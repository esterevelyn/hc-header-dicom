TI	Carrier-state of D allele in ACE gene insertion/deletion polymorphism is associated with coronary artery disease, in contrast to the C677--&gt;T transition in the MTHFR gene.
PG	527-34
AB	Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE), which plays an important role in blood pressure regulation, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) involved in homocysteine metabolism belong to a large group of polypeptides which may be potential risk factors for atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease (CAD). To assess whether polymorphisms of the genes encoding these peptides are associated with CAD in Silesian we conducted a study among 68 individuals suffering from CAD (including 52 cases after myocardial infarction), 51 subjects with positive family history of CAD and 111 controls. We analysed the distribution of genotypes and allele frequencies of the insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism in the ACE gene using PCR amplification, and the C677--&gt;T polymorphism in the MTHFR gene using PCR-RFLP analysis. We found that D allele frequency was significantly higher in CAD patients (61%) than in controls (43%) (P = 0.001, OR = 2.06). The D allele carriers (DD + ID genotypes) were more frequent in the CAD patients (85%) compared to control group (65%) (P = 0.003, OR = 3.14), whereas the familial CAD risk group shows the highest frequency of the ID genotype (57% vs 43% in controls). In contrast, the MTHFR polymorphism does not seem to be associated with the disease. Our data indicate that in Silesian CAD patients the disease is strongly associated with carrier-state of the ACE D allele, but not with the C677--&gt;T transition in the MTHFR gene.

TI	Transforming growth factor-beta1 gene C-509T and T869C polymorphisms as possible risk factors in rheumatic heart disease in Egypt.
PG	177-83
AB	OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the possible relationship between the TGF-beta1 gene C-509T and T869C polymorphisms and rheumatic heart disease (RHD), as well as their clinical significance. METHODS: Seventy-three patients with RHD diagnosed by echocardiography (mean age 31.7 +/	14.7 y, male: female ratio 20:53) and, fifty-five age and sex-matched unrelated healthy volunteers (normal control) were included. Patients were classified according to age into children (n=24, mean age 14.4 +/	3.1 y, and adults (n=49, mean age 40.2 +/	9.9 y). TGF-beta genomic DNA was extracted and amplified using primers specific for C-509T and,T869C polymorphisms. Genotyping was performed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (RFLP). RESULTS: T869C TT genotype was found significantly more frequently in RHD (total population) (OR: 3.27; [95% CI: 1.13-9.46]; P = 0.02), in children (OR: 6.0; [95% CI: 1.74-20.65]; P = 0.002) and in patients with combined valvular disease (CVD) (OR: 4.06; [95% CI: 1.32-12.48]; P = 0.01) compared to control subjects. 869T allele frequency was significantly higher in adults (OR: 1.89; [95% CI: 1.07-3.33]; P = 0.02), children (OR: 2.32; [95% CI: 1.16-4.66]; P = 0.0 1) and the total population (OR: 2.02; [95% CI: 1.21-3.39]; P = 0.006). C-509T genotypes distributions were not different between RHD patients and control subjects. However, -509T allele seems to confer susceptibility to RHD (OR: 1.78; [95% CI: 1.02-3.11]; P = 0.04). Both adults and children showed no significant difference in the genotypes distribution and allelic frequencies of TGF-beta1 C-509T polymorphism. In addition, genotype distribution and allelic frequencies of C-509T or T869C did not have any relation with the severity of the valvular affection. CONCLUSION: TGF-beta1 T869C TT genotype, 869T allele and 509T allele are possible risk factor for RHD in Egypt. Future studies on larger populations are warranted.

TI	Predisposing genetic factors for diabetic polyneuropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes: a population-based case-control study.
PG	S375-9
AB	Oxidative stress plays a key role in the development of microvascular complications of diabetes mellitus (DM). Antioxidant enzymes protect against the rapid onset of diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) by reducing oxidative stress. Genetic variations that affect activity or expression levels of the antioxidant enzymes may therefore be associated with susceptibility to DPN. We examined polymorphic markers Ala(-9)Val in SOD2 gene and Arg213Gly in SOD3 gene for possible relation to DPN in Russian type 1 diabetic patients. Four hundred Russian white patients with type 1 diabetes were studied using neurological examination according to recommendations of the San Antonio Conference on Diabetic Neuropathy. Two groups were formed from the general sample. Definition of frequency distribution of the polymorphic markers was performed in these groups using the polymerase chain reaction. Genes encoding the enzymes Mn-SOD and extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) were found to be associated with the pathogenesis of DPN.

TI	Significant association between a silent polymorphism in the neuromedin B gene and body weight in German children and adolescents.
PG	93-101
AB	Neuromedin B has been shown to exert an inhibiting effect on food consumption in rats. The corresponding gene NMB maps to chromosome 15q22.3-q23, a region expected to contain a gene for the Bardet-Biedl syndrome type 4 (BBS4). Based on its map position and the putative function of the encoded peptide, NMB can be considered as a candidate gene both for BBS4 and the development of human obesity. To examine its involvement in these phenotypes, we determined the genomic structure of human NMB, and performed a mutation screen in its coding region. In genomic DNA of six BBS4 patients and in a large population sample, two sequence variants were detected: a g.253C--&gt;A transversion creating a P73T substitution and a g.401G--&gt;A silent mutation changing the stop codon TGA into stop codon TAA. A case-control study with 92 extremely obese patients and 94 underweight students revealed a significant association between the g.401G--&gt;A polymorphism and body weight (adjustedp = 0.03), which was confirmed in a validation sample consisting of 95 extremely obese patients, and 95 normal weight and 48 underweight individuals (Mann-Whitney p = 0.02). These results suggest a contribution of NMB or a gene in its close vicinity to genetic weight control in humans.

TI	Prevalence of the C677T methylenetetra	hydrofolate reductase mutation in Thai patients with deep vein thrombosis.
PG	191-6
AB	We investigated the prevalence of a genetic variation in the 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene (C677T) using polymerase chain reaction techniques in a sample of 500 general Thai population and among 40 unselected Thai patients with an objectively confirmed history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The prevalence of the mutated homozygous and heterozygous C677T MTHFR genotype in the group of 500 healthy Thai population was 1.4 and 25.6%, respectively (allele frequency of 14.2%). Of the 40 patients studied, none were homozygotes and 15% were heterozygotes for the C677T MTHFR gene mutation (allele frequency of 7.5%). There was no significant difference in genotype frequency between patients and control groups (p = 0.09). Odds ratios for the probability of the C677T MTHFR gene mutation in the patient versus control group were 0.49 (95% CI 0. 21-1.12). These data indicated that the C677T MTHF gene mutation was not associated with DVT in the Thai population. The lower frequency of the C677T MTHFR gene mutation in our Thai population compared with reports from other studies suggests a wide heterogeneity in the 677T MTHFR genotype frequencies of the different ethnic populations even among Asians.

TI	[Evaluation of a newly discovered LDL receptor mutation (exon 10, GAC&gt;AAC, D271N, &quot;FH Graz-1&quot;) in familial hypercholesterolemia-	a familystudy].
PG	20-5
AB	Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH, prevalence 1:500) is a major cause of early atherosclerotic disease. Little is known about possible co-factors influencing individual patient's risk. We investigated this question in a large family carrying a new LDL-receptor-mutation. Genetic analysis of all exons of the LDL-receptor gene in the index case using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) revealed a previously unknown mutation in exon 10 (GAC &gt; ACC, D471N, &quot;FH Graz-1&quot;). Investigation of 21 family members (15 females, 6 males), aged 17 to 86 years, revealed 9 female and 4 male carriers of the mutation. 7 female carriers aged 17 to 58 years show no clinical signs of macrovascular disease. An 86-year old female patient, who was asymptomatic until 85, recently suffered a transient cerebral ischemic attack. All these females were normotensive. The only hypertensive 76-year old patient (ex-smoker with a history of 15 pack years) suffers from angina pectoris. 2 male carriers of the mutation (32 and 38 years old) are asymptomatic. A 65-year old patient suffers from cardiovascular disease. A 49-year old patient had a coronary artery bypass graft after a myocardial infarction at the age of 37. Additionally he has a history of bilateral thrombendarterectomy of the carotid arteries and suffers from bilateral peripheral artery disease. This patient also carries the apoE-genotype 4/3, which might be responsible for his poor response to stain therapy, and needs extracorporal lipid elimination (LDL-C &gt; 200 mg/dl under drug therapy). Both of his daughters are homozygous for the apoE-allele 3 and and responded well to stain therapy. Genetic analysis in patients with FH assures diagnosis, but is not sufficient to determine the individual patient's risk. A precise clinical examination remains the gold standard for individual risk evaluation.

TI	Association of the C677T methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase mutation with congenital heart diseases.
PG	1134-40
AB	BACKGROUND: To investigate whether the cytosine-to-thymine mutation at base 677 of the gene for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is associated with congenital heart diseases (CHD), using high throughput heteroduplex analysis based upon the powerful technique of denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. METHODS: We investigated the MTHFR genotype of a cytosine-to-thymine mutation at base 677 for 213 patients of CHDs as confirmed by cardiac catheterization and also for 195 healthy controls. RESULTS: The overall genotype frequencies of the MTHFR C677T polymorphism were not significantly different between the CHD patients and the healthy control (P = 0.345). Furthermore, taking various subgroups of CHD patients into consideration, we noted a significantly increased proportion of homozygous TT genotypes for patients suffering from valvular pulmonary stenosis (PS) or pulmonary atresia with an intact ventricular septum (PA + IVS) (p = 0.0005). For patients revealing heterotaxy syndrome, a conotruncal anomaly including tetralogy of Fallot, an interruption of the aortic arch, persistent truncus arteriosus, and aortopulmonary window, no statistically significant difference existed. CONCLUSIONS: The discrepancy in the distribution of MTHFR genotypes amongst various subtypes of CHD reflects some heterogeneity in the developmental mechanism of CHD. The increased percentage of homozygous TT genotypes might contribute to the pathogenesis of valvular PS and PA + IVS.

TI	A mutation in Wolfram syndrome type 1 gene in a Japanese family with autosomal dominant low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss.
PG	1189-94
AB	CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that Wolfram syndrome type 1 gene (WFS1) mutation is an important cause of autosomal dominant low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss (LFSNHL) in Japan. OBJECTIVE: DFNA6/14 is caused by a heterozygous mutation of WFS1 and is a common cause of autosomal dominant LFSNHL among populations in both Europe and the US. The purpose of this study was to investigate WFS1 mutations among Japanese patients whose phenotypes were consistent with those of DFNA6/14. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using audiometry and genetic analysis, we searched for WFS1 mutations in three unrelated Japanese patients with LFSNHL and a familial history of autosomal dominant hearing loss. RESULTS: One patient carried a heterozygous G2700A mutation at codon 844 in exon 8, resulting in substitution of a threonine for an alanine (A844T). Genetic analysis of the available members of the patient's family showed that the A844T mutation segregated with LFSNHL, but was not detected in any of 140 control chromosomes. It thus appears likely that the A844T mutation is causative for hearing loss in this group. Speech audiometry, self-recording audiometry and auditory brainstem responses showed the patient to have cochlear deafness without retrocochlear dysfunction. No mutation was found in the other two patients.

TI	Epigenetic modulation at birth	altered DNA-methylation in white blood cells after Caesarean section.
PG	1096-9
AB	AIM: Delivery by C-section (CS) has been associated with increased risk for allergy, diabetes and leukaemia. Whereas the underlying cause is unknown, epigenetic change of the genome has been suggested as a candidate molecular mechanism for perinatal contributions to later disease risk. We hypothesized that mode of delivery affects epigenetic activity in newborn infants. METHODS: A total of 37 newborn infants were included. Spontaneous vaginal delivery (VD) occurred in 21, and 16 infants were delivered by elective CS. Blood was sampled from the umbilical cord and 3-5 days after birth. DNA-methylation was analyzed in leucocytes. RESULTS: Infants born by CS exhibited higher DNA-methylation in leucocytes compared with that of those born by VD (p &lt; 0.001). After VD, newborn infants exhibited stable levels of DNA-methylation, as evidenced by comparing cord blood values with those 3-5 days after birth (p = 0.55). On postnatal days 3-5, DNA-methylation had decreased in the CS group (p = 0.01) and was no longer significantly different from that of VD (p = 0.10). CONCLUSION: DNA-methylation is higher in infants delivered by CS than in infants vaginally born. Although currently unknown how gene expression is affected, or whether epigenetic differences related to mode of delivery are long-lasting, our findings open a new area of clinical research with potentially important public health implications.

TI	Genetic factors and clinical significance of acanthosis nigricans in obese Japanese children and adolescents.
PG	170-5
AB	AIM: To clarify the clinical significance of acanthosis nigricans (AN) and the association of gene polymorphisms in the ss2	and ss3-adrenergic receptors (B2ADR and B3ADR) in Japanese obese children and adolescents. METHODS: Seventy obese subjects (56 boys, 14 girls) from 5 to 19 y of age were examined as to clinical features. Genetic analyses were performed in 83 obese subjects (61 boys, 22 girls), 2 to 17 y of age. Typing of gene polymorphisms in B2ADR and B3ADR was achieved by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of genomic DNA and restriction fragment-length polymorphism analysis (PCR-RFLP). RESULTS: The group with AN (n = 30) had higher values for percent overweight, BMI, waist circumference, fasting insulin, HOMA-R, leptin and PAI-1 than the AN-negative group (n = 40), but there were no significant differences in age, sex or percent body fat between the two groups. The prevalences of B2ADR Gly16 and B3ADR Arg64 were significantly higher in AN-positive (n = 26) than in AN-negative (n = 57) subjects. In addition, the AN frequency was significantly higher in the group with both Gly16 and Arg64 than in the group with neither of these alleles (55.6% vs 12.5%, p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that AN is a useful clinical marker for the severity of obesity associated with a high BMI, and that B2ADR Gly16 and B3ADR Arg64 are associated synergistically with AN in obese children and adolescents.

TI	Clinical features and molecular genetic analysis of a boy with Prader-Willi syndrome caused by an imprinting defect.
PG	906-10
AB	Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a neuroendocrine disorder caused by a non-functioning paternally derived gene(s) within the chromosome region 15q11-q13. Most cases result from microscopically visible deletions of paternal origin, or maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 15. In both instances no recurrence has been reported. In rare cases, PWS is associated with lack of gene expression from the paternal allele due to an imprinting defect. We report the clinical features and the molecular genetic analysis of the first Danish child with PWS due to a defect of the putative imprinting centre (IC). When the imprinting mutation is inherited from a carrier father, the risk that future children will be affected is theoretically 50%. It is therefore important that these families are referred to a geneticist for counselling and further investigation. Prenatal diagnosis is currently only feasible when the mutation has been identified in the affected child.

TI	Islet structure and function in the GK rat.
PG	479-500
AB	Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) arises when the endocrine pancreas fails to secrete sufficient insulin to cope with the metabolic demand because of beta-cell secretory dysfunction and/or decreased beta-cell mass. Defining the nature of the pancreatic islet defects present in T2D has been difficult, in part because human islets are inaccessible for direct study. This review is aimed to illustrate to what extent the Goto-Kakizaki rat, one of the best characterized animal models of spontaneous T2D, has proved to be a valuable tool offering sufficient commonalities to study this aspect. A comprehensive compendium of the multiple functional GK islet abnormalities so far identified is proposed in this perspective. The pathogenesis of defective beta-cell number and function in the GK model is also discussed. It is proposed that the development of T2D in the GK model results from the complex interaction of multiple events: (i) several susceptibility loci containing genes responsible for some diabetic traits (distinct loci encoding impairment of beta-cell metabolism and insulin exocytosis, but no quantitative trait locus for decreased beta-cell mass); (ii) gestational metabolic impairment inducing an epigenetic programming of the offspring pancreas (decreased beta-cell neogenesis and proliferation) transmitted over generations; and (iii) loss of beta-cell differentiation related to chronic exposure to hyperglycaemia/hyperlipidaemia, islet inflammation, islet oxidative stress, islet fibrosis and perturbed islet vasculature.

TI	Tissue specific adaptations to nutrient supply: more than just epigenetics?
PG	113-8
AB	Changes in the maternal diet either throughout pregnancy, or at defined stages therein, can have pronounced effects on organogenesis in conjunction with endocrine sensitivity. These processes can be brought about by either maternal consumption of an imbalanced diet and/or a global reduction in macro or micro-nutrient intake. The magnitude of adaptation in the fetus or offspring is dependent on which organ is most rapidly growing and developing at that particular stage of the life cycle. For a majority of organs, the period of developmental plasticity extends beyond the fetal period, continuing through lactation and into the juvenile period. During lactation, enhanced growth of the offspring appears to be a primary determinant of the magnitude of adverse cardiovascular outcome. Consequently, a change in organ development during pregnancy may not necessarily equate with compromised function in later life. In the kidney, for example, adaptations in its endocrine sensitivity to maternal nutrient restriction through fetal development can be protective against the adverse consequences of later obesity. Such adaptations do not simply represent epigenetic modifications but a plethora of responses that, taken together, can prevent, or delay, at least in the kidney, the onset of apoptosis and later glomerulosclerosis.

TI	Imprinted genes, postnatal adaptations and enduring effects on energy homeostasis.
PG	41-61
AB	The effects of imprinted genes on fetal growth and development have been firmly established. By and large, their roles conform to a conflict over provision of limited maternal resources to offspring, such that paternally expressed imprinted genes in offspring generally promote growth of the fetus, while maternally expressed imprinted genes tend to restrict it. It is comparatively recently that the important effects of imprinted genes in postnatal physiology have begun to be demonstrated, although a similar conflict may apply. In this chapter, we shall review some of the genetic evidence for imprinted effects on obesity, consider the action of selected imprinted genes in the central and peripheral control of energy homeostasis and look in detail at the intriguing effects of imprinting at the Gnas locus. Finally, we shall discuss whether these observations fit expectations of the prevailing theory for the existence of imprinting in mammals and go on to consider imprinted genes as targets for developmental programming.

TI	Maternal HIV type 1 infection suppresses MMP-1 expression in endothelial cells of uninfected newborns: nonviral vertical transmission of HIV type 1-related effects.
PG	940-4
AB	HIV-1 infection is associated with vascular alterations. This is accompanied by an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and Kaposi's sarcoma, an endothelial cell-derived tumor. We investigated the impact of maternal HIV-1 infection on phenotype and gene expression of endothelial cells in newborns. For this reason endothelial precursor cells and differentiated endothelial cells were isolated from cord blood as well as from umbilical veins and arteries of noninfected infants born to HIV-1-infected (H-group) and noninfected (Ngroup) mothers. No apparent differences in proliferation, capillary formation, and expression of endothelial cell markers were detected in these cells. Interestingly, the expression of matrix metalloproteinase was repressed significantly (X2 analysis, p &lt; 0.002) and consistently at the RNA, the protein, and the secretory levels in the H-group as compared to the N-group. Neither treatment with zidovudine (AZT), mutations in the matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) promoter, nor epigenetic changes in the promoter methylation pattern were responsible for the repression of MMP-1 expression in H-group endothelial cells. The reduced MMP-1 expression may contribute to the impaired cardiac function that has been observed in children of HIV-1-infected women. Most interestingly, our findings indicate that HIV-1-related effects can be transferred from mother to child in the absence of HIV-1 transmission.

TI	Single-nucleotide polymorphisms of VEGF gene are associated with risk of congenital valvuloseptal heart defects.
PG	878-81
AB	BACKGROUND: Disturbed vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production during early heart morphogenesis causes endocardial cushion malformation, which results in congenital heart disease (CHD). We tested whether functional VEGF -460T/C and +405G/C polymorphisms that have an impact on VEGF levels were associated with CHD. METHODS: Dried blood samples were collected from 102 CHD children and 112 healthy control neonates. Genotyping was done with polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (VEGF +405G/C) and real-time polymerase chain reaction methods (VEGF -460T/C). RESULTS: VEGF -460C allele frequency was similar in control and CHD subjects. VEGF +405C allele was less prevalent in controls than in CHD subjects (0.21 vs 0.42, P &lt; .001). Having VEGF +405C presented increased risk for CHD (odds ratio [OR] 1.72, 95% CI 1.32-2.26). VEGF -460CT/+405CC allele associations did not occur in controls but in CHD patients (0% vs 13%, OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.93-2.64), whereas -460CT/+405GG allele association was more prevalent in controls (32% vs 16%, OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.37-0.89). CONCLUSIONS: VEGF gene and allele associations may be associated with increased risk of CHD.

TI	Angiotensinogen gene polymorphism in Japanese patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
PG	184-9
AB	To examine the contribution of the renin-angiotensin system to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), we studied 96 patients with HCM (mean age 50 years, 55% male), 105 of their unaffected siblings and offspring, and 160 healthy subjects without known hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) who were frequency matched to cases by age and sex. Patients were divided into familial or sporadic HCM (FHCM or SHCM) groups with or without affected members of their family. The region of interest in the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene, the missense mutation with methione-to-threonine amino acid substitution at codon 235 in angiotensinogen (M235T), was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with the use of allele-specific oligonucleotide primers flanking the polymorphic region of the AGT gene to amplify template deoxyribonucleic acid prepared from peripheral leukocytes. The T allele frequency was higher in the SHCM group than in unaffected siblings and offspring (88% vs 78%, X2 = 4.6, p &lt; 0.05). The M allele frequency was higher in unaffected siblings and offspring than in patients with SHCM (23% vs 12%, X2 = 4.6, p &lt; 0.05). The T allele frequency among unaffected siblings and offspring was similar to that observed in healthy subjects (78% vs 78%). We conclude that HCM, especially in sporadic cases, is partially determined by genetic disposition. The molecular variant of angiotensinogen T235 seems to be a predisposing factor for cardiac hypertrophy in HCM and carries an approximately twofold increased risk.

TI	Infant feeding and the risk of type 1 diabetes.
PG	1506S-1513S
AB	Type 1 diabetes is generally considered to be a chronic, immune-mediated disease with a subclinical prodrome during which beta cell autoimmunity becomes overt disease at a variable rate in genetically susceptible individuals. Accumulated evidence supports a critical role of environmental factors in its development. Prospective birth cohort studies show that the first signs of beta cell autoimmunity may be initiated during the first year of life. This implies that risk factors for beta cell autoimmunity and type 1 diabetes must be operative in infancy. Early nutrition provides essential exogenous exposures in that period. This article discusses the role of factors related to infant nutrition in the development of beta cell autoimmunity and type 1 diabetes and the potential mechanistic pathways involved. So far, no specific dietary factor has been shown to be an unequivocal risk factor for beta cell autoimmunity or type 1 diabetes, and there are a number of contradictory observations with regard to the effect of various foods. This may reflect geographic and cultural differences in infant-feeding practices. Most studies suggest that the early introduction of complex foreign proteins may be a risk factor for beta cell autoimmunity, and a pilot intervention trial has implied that weaning to a highly hydrolyzed formula may decrease the risk of beta cell autoimmunity. Lack of vitamin D supplementation and accelerated growth might increase the risk of type 1 diabetes. Additional work, which includes the application of modern approaches such as metabolomics and epigenomics, is needed to discern the contribution of dietary factors in infancy to the diabetic disease process.

TI	Postprandial responses in hunger and satiety are associated with the rs9939609 single nucleotide polymorphism in FTO.
PG	1426-32
AB	BACKGROUND: The common rs9939609 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene is associated with adiposity, possibly by affecting satiety responsiveness. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine whether postprandial responses in hunger and satiety are associated with rs9939609, taking interactions with other relevant candidate genes into account. DESIGN: Sixty-two women and 41 men [age: 31 +/	14 y; body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 25.0 +/	3.1] were genotyped for 5 SNPs in FTO, DNMT1, DNMT3B, LEP, and LEPR. Individuals received fixed meals provided in energy balance. Hunger and satiety were determined pre	and postprandially by using visual analog scales. RESULTS: A general association test showed a significant association between postprandial responses in hunger and satiety with rs9939609 (P = 0.036 and P = 0.050, respectively). Individuals with low postprandial responses in hunger and satiety were overrepresented among TA/AA carriers in rs9939609 (FTO) compared with TT carriers (dominant and additive model: P = 0.013 and P = 0.020, respectively). Moreover, multifactor dimensionality reduction showed significant epistatic interactions for the postprandial decrease in hunger involving rs9939609 (FTO), rs992472 (DNMT3B), and rs1137101 (LEPR). Individuals with a low postprandial decrease in hunger were overrepresented among TA/AA (dominant), CC/CA (recessive), and AG/GG (dominant) carriers in rs9939609 (FTO), rs992472 (DNMT3B), and rs1137101 (LEPR), respectively (n = 39), compared with TT, AA, and/or AA carriers in these SNPs, respectively (P = 0.00001). Each SNP had an additional effect. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm a role for FTO in responsiveness to hunger and satiety cues in adults in an experimental setting. The epistatic interaction suggests that DNA methylation, an epigenetic process, affects appetite.

TI	Genetic influences on blood lipids and cardiovascular disease risk: tools for primary prevention.
PG	1509S-1517S
AB	Genetic polymorphism in human populations is part of the evolutionary process that results from the interaction between the environment and the human genome. Recent changes in diet have upset this equilibrium, potentially influencing the risk of most common morbidities such as cardiovascular diseases, obesity, diabetes, and cancer. Reduction of these conditions is a major public health concern, and such a reduction could be achieved by improving our ability to detect disease predisposition early in life and by providing more personalized behavioral recommendations for successful primary prevention. In terms of cardiovascular diseases, polymorphisms at multiple genes have been associated with differential effects in terms of lipid metabolism; however, the connection with cardiovascular disease has been more elusive, and considerable heterogeneity exists among studies regarding the predictive value of genetic markers. This may be because of experimental limitations, the intrinsic complexity of the phenotypes, and the aforementioned interactions with environmental factors. The integration of genetic and environmental complexity into current and future research will drive the field toward the implementation of clinical tools aimed at providing dietary advice optimized for the individual's genome. This may imply that dietary changes are implemented early in life to gain maximum benefit. However, it is important to highlight that most reported studies have focused on adult populations and to extrapolate these findings to children and adolescents may not be justified until proper studies have been carried out in these populations and until the ethical and legal issues associated with this new field are adequately addressed.

TI	Is folic acid good for everyone?
PG	517-33
AB	Fortification of food with folic acid to reduce the number of neural tube defects was introduced 10 y ago in North America. Many countries are considering whether to adopt this policy. When fortification is introduced, several hundred thousand people are exposed to an increased intake of folic acid for each neural tube defect pregnancy that is prevented. Are the benefits to the few outweighed by possible harm to some of the many exposed? In animals, a folic acid-rich diet can influence DNA and histone methylation, which leads to phenotypic changes in subsequent generations. In humans, increased folic acid intake leads to elevated blood concentrations of naturally occurring folates and of unmetabolized folic acid. High blood concentrations of folic acid may be related to decreased natural killer cell cytotoxicity, and high folate status may reduce the response to antifolate drugs used against malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and cancer. In the elderly, a combination of high folate levels and low vitamin B-12 status may be associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment and anemia and, in pregnant women, with an increased risk of insulin resistance and obesity in their children. Folate has a dual effect on cancer, protecting against cancer initiation but facilitating progression and growth of preneoplastic cells and subclinical cancers, which are common in the population. Thus, a high folic acid intake may be harmful for some people. Nations considering fortification should be cautious and stimulate further research to identify the effects, good and bad, caused by a high intake of folic acid from fortified food or dietary supplements. Only then can authorities develop the right strategies for the population as a whole.

TI	Variants of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma	and beta-adrenergic receptor genes are associated with measures of compensatory eating behaviors in young children.
PG	167-73
AB	BACKGROUND: Young children can regulate energy precisely in the short term, showing the potential for an innate compensation mechanism of eating behavior. However, data suggest that precise compensation is attenuated as a function of increasing adiposity, parental feeding style, and age. Common variation in candidate obesity genes may account for some of the individual variation observed in short-term energy compensation. Polymorphisms in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) and beta-adrenergic receptor (ADRB3) genes have been linked to increased body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)), obesity, and more recently dietary nutrients and preferences. In addition, common variation in ADRB3 interacts with PPARG to modulate adult body weight. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated whether variants in these genes were associated with measurable effects on child eating behavior. DESIGN: Children (n=84) aged 4-10 y were prospectively selected for variants of the PPARG locus (Pro12Ala, C1431T). Heights and weights were measured. Energy intake from a test meal was measured 90 min after ingestion of a no-energy (NE), low-energy (LE), or high-energy (HE) preload, and the compensation index (COMPX) was calculated. RESULTS: BMI differed significantly by gene model, whereby Pro12Ala was associated with a lower BMI. Poor COMPX was associated with the PPARG T1431 allele (P=0.009). There was a significant interaction between COMPX and the ADRB3 Trp64Arg variant in modulating compensation (P=0.003), whereas the Arg64 allele was associated with good compensation (P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to suggest that a genetic interaction involving ADRB3 and PPARG variants influences eating behavior in children.

TI	Molecular genetic analysis of the von Hippel-Lindau disease tumor suppressor gene in familial and sporadic cerebellar hemangioblastomas.
PG	459-66
AB	Cerebellar hemangioblastoma is one of the most frequent manifestations of the autosomal dominantly inherited von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease but also may manifest as a sporadic tumor. The purpose of this study was to define the alterations of the VHL gene in hemangioblastomas. We analyzed nine specimens from eight cerebellar hemangioblastomas (three familial and five sporadic) and six blood samples from family members of two unrelated pedigrees for mutations of the VHL gene using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing. We identified germline mutations in all VHL-associated tumors and somatic mutations in two (40%) of five sporadic hemangioblastomas. We also observed germline mutations in the peripheral blood DNA from members of two unrelated families; one is currently without VHL manifestations, and the other is affected. In addition, loss of heterozygosity of allelic markers on chromosome 3p were examined by four polymorphic microsatellite markers, and aberrant methylation of the VHL gene was investigated with a methylation-sensitive enzyme, Sma I. Allelic losses on chromosome 3p were observed from two patients with VHL disease in one family and in one of two sporadic hemangioblastomas. No hypermethylation of the VHL gene was detected in any of the tumors that we examined. Our findings suggest that the VHL tumor suppressor gene is the target for inactivation in this tumor and is involved in the pathogenesis of familial and sporadic hemangioblastomas.

TI	Single nucleotide polymorphisms in inflammation-related genes and mortality in a community-based cohort in Washington County, Maryland.
PG	807-13
AB	The purpose of this study was to examine the associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes controlling inflammatory processes and mortality. Data were analyzed from 9,933 individuals who participated in two large community-based cohort studies conducted in Washington County, Maryland, in 1974 and 1989, designated &quot;CLUE I&quot; and &quot;CLUE II,&quot; respectively. DNA from blood collected in 1989 was genotyped for 47 SNPs in 23 inflammation-related genes, including interferon-gamma (IFNgamma), lymphotoxin-alpha (LTalpha), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), C-reactive protein (CRP), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), and the human endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). All participants were followed from 1989 to the date of death or to June 20, 2005. The results showed no observable patterns of association for the SNPs and the all-cause and cause-specific mortality outcomes, although statistically significant associations were observed between at least one mortality outcome and SNPs in eNOS (reference SNP (rs) 1799983), PPARG (rs4684847), CRP (rs2794521), IFNgamma (rs2069705), TNFalpha (rs1799964), and LTalpha (rs2229094). Additionally, three of the four examined CRP SNPs were strongly associated with CRP serum concentration among those with CRP measurements. The authors' findings from this community-based prospective cohort study suggest that the selected SNPs are not associated with overall or cause-specific death, although CRP genotypes may be associated with systemic inflammation.

TI	Relation of three genetic traits to venous thrombosis in an African-American population.
PG	30-5
AB	A mutation in the Factor V gene (Factor V Leiden), a variant in the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR), and an insertion/deletion polymorphism of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme gene (ACE) may be related to abnormal blood clotting. The authors examined the associations between these genetic traits and venous thrombosis among African Americans. This study comprised 93 patients with venous thrombosis and 185 control subjects attending clinics at an urban, public hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1995-1996. Subjects' DNA was extracted from blood and assayed for these genetic traits. Odds ratios were obtained from logistic regression and used as a measure of association between each genetic trait and venous thrombosis. Factor V Leiden was unrelated to venous thrombosis, but the mutation ws too rare among our African-American subjects to evaluate adequately its relation to venous thrombosis. The homozygous and heterozygous genotypes for the V allele of the MTHFR gene were unrelated to venous thrombosis (odds ratio = 0.9, 95% confidence interval 0.5-1.8). Subjects with the deletion/deletion ACE polymorphism experienced a moderate increase in venous thrombosis risk compared with persons with the other genotypes (odds ratio = 1.5, 95% confidence interval 0.9-2.6). However, women with this ACE genotype experienced no increased risk (odds ratio = 0.9, 95% confidence interval 0.5-1.9), whereas men with this genotype had nearly three times the risk (odds ratio = 2.8, 95% confidence interval 1.2-6.2; p value for interaction = 0.06). These data indicate that the prevalence of Factor V Leiden and the V allele of the MTHFR gene is low among African Americans. The D allele of the ACE gene is equally prevalent among African Americans and whites and may be related to venous thrombosis among African-American men.

TI	Polymorphisms within the angiotensinogen gene (GT-repeat) and the risk of stroke in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease: a case-control study.
PG	164-9
AB	Stroke is one of the most devastating complications of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Currently, there are no known molecular or genetic markers that can be used to assess the risk of stroke in this population. We have previously shown that relative hypertension may be one risk factor for stroke in SCD. In a case-control study, we investigated the association between GT-repeat polymorphism within the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene and the risk of stroke in pediatric patients with SCD. After informed consent was obtained, 63 patients (21 stroke subjects and 42 nonstroke control subjects matched according to age and sex) with SCD followed at local pediatric hematology clinics were genotyped to test the association of specific GT-repeat alleles of the AGT gene and occurrence of stroke. There were statistical differences in the distribution of the genotypes among stroke and nonstroke SCD patients (chi(2) = 10.82, df = 11, P &lt; 0.05). We also found GT-repeat alleles A3 and/or A4 of the AGT gene conferred a four-fold increase in the risk of stroke (odds ratio [OR] = 4, P &lt; 0.05). The attributable odds ratio for allele A3 and A4 is 2.24 and 4.33, respectively (P &lt; 0.005). Our results suggest that GT-repeat within the AGT gene may be associated with risk of stroke in pediatric SCD. The relative risk of stroke in the presence of alleles A3 and/or A4 is fourfold greater than in the absence of these alleles. If these data are substantiated in a larger cohort of patients, our results indicate that the determination of GT-repeat of AGT gene may be a useful genetic marker to assess the risk for stroke of patients with SCD.

TI	Inherited DNA mutations contributing to thrombotic complications in patients with sickle cell disease.
PG	267-72
AB	Thrombosis may play an important role in the pathophysiology of certain complications of sickle cell disease (SCD), including stroke and avascular necrosis (AVN). Currently there is no laboratory or clinical parameter that can identify patients who are at highest risk of developing these thrombotic complications. We hypothesized that some patients with SCD have an inherited hypercoagulable state that results in an increased risk of developing stroke or AVN. We examined the role of two common inherited thrombophilic mutations that, in other populations, have been associated with arterial and venous thrombosis and are amenable to screening with DNA restriction enzyme analysis. The C677T mutation in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene and the C1565T mutation in the platelet glycoprotein IIIa (GPIIIa) gene were evaluated. We analyzed genomic DNA from 86 children and adults with SCD, including 16 patients with a history of a clinical stroke and 14 patients with AVN, for the presence of these mutations. The C677T MTHFR mutation was found in 19% of patients with stroke, 14% of patients with AVN, and 14% of patients with neither complication (P = NS). The C1565T GPIIIa mutation was found in 25% of patients with stroke, 14% of patients with AVN, and 18% of patients with neither complication (P = NS). Although each of these mutations is relatively common in patients with SCD, neither is independently associated with an increased risk of developing stroke or AVN.

TI	ADIPOQ SNP45 associated with lean body mass in physically active normal weight adolescent girls.
PG	813-8
AB	Recently, two single nucleotide polymorphisms at position 45 and 276 on the adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) have been recognized as determinants of total adiponectin levels, insulin resistance, and risk for diabetes in various obese populations. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine whether these two polymorphisms are indeed determinants in the development of metabolic disorders or whether they are secondary to other confounding factors. METHODS: To do so, we have selected 170 physically active adolescent girls (mean age, 14.03 +/	1.5 years and mean body mass index, 19.98 +/	2.5 kg/m(2)) devoid of any metabolic diseases or confounding factors, to better attribute any findings to genotype effects. Concentration of adiponectin, insulin, and glucose were determined from blood samples with appropriate kits. Body fat parameters were evaluated with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and genotype was analyzed with DNA extracted from whole blood samples followed by polymerase chain reaction and electrophoresis to separate alleles. RESULTS: Neither single nucleotide polymorphism +45T/G nor +276G/T was related to homeostasis model assessment index or adiponectin levels; however, the presence of the G allele on site 45 favored a significant decrease in lean body mass compared with those who were T homozygous (TG:36.90/TT:41.07 kg, P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that the reported increase in the risk of diabetes in subjects that were G allele carriers at site 45 in obese populations compared with normal-weight populations can be linked instead to a change in muscle mass or the muscle itself present in this genotype group.

TI	Disruption of the podosome adaptor protein TKS4 (SH3PXD2B) causes the skeletal dysplasia, eye, and cardiac abnormalities of Frank-Ter Haar Syndrome.
PG	254-61
AB	Frank-Ter Haar syndrome (FTHS), also known as Ter Haar syndrome, is an autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by skeletal, cardiovascular, and eye abnormalities, such as increased intraocular pressure, prominent eyes, and hypertelorism. We have conducted homozygosity mapping on patients representing 12 FTHS families. A locus on chromosome 5q35.1 was identified for which patients from nine families shared homozygosity. For one family, a homozygous deletion mapped exactly to the smallest region of overlapping homozygosity, which contains a single gene, SH3PXD2B. This gene encodes the TKS4 protein, a phox homology (PX) and Src homology 3 (SH3) domain-containing adaptor protein and Src substrate. This protein was recently shown to be involved in the formation of actin-rich membrane protrusions called podosomes or invadopodia, which coordinate pericellular proteolysis with cell migration. Mice lacking Tks4 also showed pronounced skeletal, eye, and cardiac abnormalities and phenocopied the majority of the defects associated with FTHS. These findings establish a role for TKS4 in FTHS and embryonic development. Mutation analysis revealed five different homozygous mutations in SH3PXD2B in seven FTHS families. No SH3PXD2B mutations were detected in six other FTHS families, demonstrating the genetic heterogeneity of this condition. Interestingly however, dermal fibroblasts from one of the individuals without an SH3PXD2B mutation nevertheless expressed lower levels of the TKS4 protein, suggesting a common mechanism underlying disease causation.

TI	Spondylocheiro dysplastic form of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome--an autosomal-recessive entity caused by mutations in the zinc transporter gene SLC39A13.
PG	1290-305
AB	We present clinical, radiological, biochemical, and genetic findings on six patients from two consanguineous families that show EDS-like features and radiological findings of a mild skeletal dysplasia. The EDS-like findings comprise hyperelastic, thin, and bruisable skin, hypermobility of the small joints with a tendency to contractures, protuberant eyes with bluish sclerae, hands with finely wrinkled palms, atrophy of the thenar muscles, and tapering fingers. The skeletal dysplasia comprises platyspondyly with moderate short stature, osteopenia, and widened metaphyses. Patients have an increased ratio of total urinary pyridinolines, lysyl pyridinoline/hydroxylysyl pyridinoline (LP/HP), of approximately 1 as opposed to approximately 6 in EDS VI or approximately 0.2 in controls. Lysyl and prolyl residues of collagens were underhydroxylated despite normal lysyl hydroxylase and prolyl 4-hydroxylase activities; underhydroxylation was a generalized process as shown by mass spectrometry of the alpha1(I)	and alpha2(I)-chain-derived peptides of collagen type I and involved at least collagen types I and II. A genome-wide SNP scan and sequence analyses identified in all patients a homozygous c.483_491 del9 SLC39A13 mutation that encodes for a membrane-bound zinc transporter SLC39A13. We hypothesize that an increased Zn(2+) content inside the endoplasmic reticulum competes with Fe(2+), a cofactor that is necessary for hydroxylation of lysyl and prolyl residues, and thus explains the biochemical findings. These data suggest an entity that we have designated &quot;spondylocheiro dysplastic form of EDS (SCD-EDS)&quot; to indicate a generalized skeletal dysplasia involving mainly the spine (spondylo) and striking clinical abnormalities of the hands (cheiro) in addition to the EDS-like features.

TI	Bayesian meta-analysis of genetic association studies with different sets of markers.
PG	859-72
AB	Robust assessment of genetic effects on quantitative traits or complex-disease risk requires synthesis of evidence from multiple studies. Frequently, studies have genotyped partially overlapping sets of SNPs within a gene or region of interest, hampering attempts to combine all the available data. By using the example of C-reactive protein (CRP) as a quantitative trait, we show how linkage disequilibrium in and around its gene facilitates use of Bayesian hierarchical models to integrate informative data from all available genetic association studies of this trait, irrespective of the SNP typed. A variable selection scheme, followed by contextualization of SNPs exhibiting independent associations within the haplotype structure of the gene, enhanced our ability to infer likely causal variants in this region with population-scale data. This strategy, based on data from a literature based systematic review and substantial new genotyping, facilitated the most comprehensive evaluation to date of the role of variants governing CRP levels, providing important information on the minimal subset of SNPs necessary for comprehensive evaluation of the likely causal relevance of elevated CRP levels for coronary-heart-disease risk by Mendelian randomization. The same method could be applied to evidence synthesis of other quantitative traits, whenever the typed SNPs vary among studies, and to assist fine mapping of causal variants.

TI	Multiple genes for essential-hypertension susceptibility on chromosome 1q.
PG	253-64
AB	Essential hypertension, defined as elevated levels of blood pressure (BP) without any obvious cause, is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease, stroke, and renal disease. BP levels and susceptibility to development of essential hypertension are partially determined by genetic factors that are poorly understood. Similar to other efforts to understand complex, non-Mendelian phenotypes, genetic dissection of hypertension-related traits employs genomewide linkage analyses of families and association studies of patient cohorts, to uncover rare and common disease alleles, respectively. Family-based mapping studies of elevated BP cover the large intermediate ground for identification of genes with common variants of significant effect. Our genomewide linkage and candidate-gene-based association studies demonstrate that a replicated linkage peak for BP regulation on human chromosome 1q, homologous to mouse and rat quantitative trait loci for BP, contains at least three genes associated with BP levels in multiple samples: ATP1B1, RGS5, and SELE. Individual variants in these three genes account for 2-5-mm Hg differences in mean systolic BP levels, and the cumulative effect reaches 8-10 mm Hg. Because the associated alleles in these genes are relatively common (frequency &gt;5%), these three genes are important contributors to elevated BP in the population at large.

TI	Permanent neonatal diabetes caused by dominant, recessive, or compound heterozygous SUR1 mutations with opposite functional effects.
PG	375-82
AB	Heterozygous activating mutations in the KCNJ11 gene encoding the pore-forming Kir6.2 subunit of the pancreatic beta cell K(ATP) channel are the most common cause of permanent neonatal diabetes (PNDM). Patients with PNDM due to a heterozygous activating mutation in the ABCC8 gene encoding the SUR1 regulatory subunit of the K(ATP) channel have recently been reported. We studied a cohort of 59 patients with permanent diabetes who received a diagnosis before 6 mo of age and who did not have a KCNJ11 mutation. ABCC8 gene mutations were identified in 16 of 59 patients and included 8 patients with heterozygous de novo mutations. A recessive mode of inheritance was observed in eight patients with homozygous, mosaic, or compound heterozygous mutations. Functional studies of selected mutations showed a reduced response to ATP consistent with an activating mutation that results in reduced insulin secretion. A novel mutational mechanism was observed in which a heterozygous activating mutation resulted in PNDM only when a second, loss-of-function mutation was also present.

TI	Polymorphisms within the C-reactive protein (CRP) promoter region are associated with plasma CRP levels.
PG	64-77
AB	Elevated plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), an inflammation-sensitive marker, have emerged as an important predictor of future cardiovascular disease and metabolic abnormalities in apparently healthy men and women. Here, we performed a systematic survey of common nucleotide variation across the genomic region encompassing the CRP gene locus. Of the common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified, several in the CRP promoter region are strongly associated with CRP levels in a large cohort study of cardiovascular risk in European American and African American young adults. We also demonstrate the functional importance of these SNPs in vitro.

TI	A genomewide scan for type 1-diabetes susceptibility in Scandinavian families: identification of new loci with evidence of interactions.
PG	1301-13
AB	Type 1 diabetes mellitus (TIDM) has a multifactorial etiology, with major genetic-susceptibility determinants located in the HLA and insulin-gene (INS) regions. Linkage data implicating other disease-susceptibility loci are conflicting. This is likely due to (1) the limited power for detection of contributions of additional susceptibility loci, given the limited number of informative families available for study, (2) factors such as genetic heterogeneity between populations, and (3) potential gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. To circumvent some of these problems, we have conducted a genomewide linkage analysis for T1DM-susceptibility loci in 408 multiplex families from Scandinavia, a population expected to be homogeneous for genetic and environmental factors. In addition to verifying the HLA and INS susceptibility loci, the study provides confirmation of IDDM15 on chromosome 6q21. Suggestive evidence of additional susceptibility loci was found on chromosomes 2p, 5q, and 16p. For some loci, the support for linkage increased substantially when families were stratified on the basis of HLA or INS genotypes, with statistically significant heterogeneity between the stratified subgroups. Our data support both the existence of non-HLA genes of significance for T1DM and interaction between HLA and non-HLA loci in the determination of the T1DM phenotype.

TI	The Turner syndrome-associated neurocognitive phenotype maps to distal Xp.
PG	672-81
AB	Turner syndrome (TS) is associated with a characteristic neurocognitive profile that includes impaired visuospatial/perceptual abilities. We used a molecular approach to identify a critical region of the X chromosome for neurocognitive aspects of TS. Partial deletions of Xp in 34 females were mapped by FISH or by loss of heterozygosity of polymorphic markers. Discriminant function analysis optimally identified the TS-associated neurocognitive phenotype. Only subjects missing approximately 10 Mb of distal Xp manifested the specified neurocognitive profile. The phenotype was seen with either paternally or maternally inherited deletions and with either complete or incomplete skewing of X inactivation. Fine mapping of informative deletions implicated a critical region of &lt;2 Mb within the pseudoautosomal region (PAR1). We conclude that haploinsufficiency of PAR1 gene(s) is the basis for susceptibility to the TS neurocognitive phenotype.

TI	Partial paternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 6 in an infant with neonatal diabetes, macroglossia, and craniofacial abnormalities.
PG	1586-91
AB	Neonatal diabetes, which can be transient or permanent, is defined as hyperglycemia that presents within the first month of life and requires insulin therapy. Transient neonatal diabetes mellitus has been associated with abnormalities of the paternally inherited copy of chromosome 6, including duplications of a portion of the long arm of chromosome 6 and uniparental disomy, implicating overexpression of an imprinted gene in this disorder. To date, all patients with transient neonatal diabetes mellitus and uniparental disomy have had complete paternal isodisomy. We describe a patient with neonatal diabetes, macroglossia, and craniofacial abnormalities, with partial paternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 6 involving the distal portion of 6q, from 6q24-qter. This observation demonstrates that mitotic recombination of chromosome 6 can also give rise to uniparental disomy and neonatal diabetes, a situation similar to that observed in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, another imprinted disorder. This finding has clinical implications, since somatic mosaicism for uniparental disomy of chromosome 6 should also be considered in patients with transient neonatal diabetes mellitus.

TI	Clinical and molecular genetic analysis of 19 Wolfram syndrome kindreds demonstrating a wide spectrum of mutations in WFS1.
PG	1279-90
AB	Wolfram syndrome is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus and progressive optic atrophy. mtDNA deletions have been described, and a gene (WFS1) recently has been identified, on chromosome 4p16, encoding a predicted 890 amino acid transmembrane protein. Direct DNA sequencing was done to screen the entire coding region of the WFS1 gene in 30 patients from 19 British kindreds with Wolfram syndrome. DNA was also screened for structural rearrangements (deletions and duplications) and point mutations in mtDNA. No pathogenic mtDNA mutations were found in our cohort. We identified 24 mutations in the WFS1 gene: 8 nonsense mutations, 8 missense mutations, 3 in-frame deletions, 1 in-frame insertion, and 4 frameshift mutations. Of these, 23 were novel mutations, and most occurred in exon 8. The majority of patients were compound heterozygotes for two mutations, and there was no common founder mutation. The data were also analyzed for genotype-phenotype relationships. Although some interesting cases were noted, consideration of the small sample size and frequency of each mutation indicated no clear-cut correlations between any of the observed mutations and disease severity. There were no obvious mutation hot spots or clusters. Hence, molecular screening for Wolfram syndrome in affected families and for Wolfram syndrome-carrier status in subjects with psychiatric disorders or diabetes mellitus will require complete analysis of exon 8 and upstream exons.

TI	Imprinting-mutation mechanisms in Prader-Willi syndrome.
PG	397-413
AB	Microdeletions of a region termed the &quot;imprinting center&quot; (IC) in chromosome 15q11-q13 have been identified in several families with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) or Angelman syndrome who show epigenetic inheritance for this region that is consistent with a mutation in the imprinting process. The IC controls resetting of parental imprints in 15q11-q13 during gametogenesis. We have identified a larger series of cases of familial PWS, including one case with a deletion of only 7.5 kb, that narrows the PWS critical region to &lt;4. 3 kb spanning the SNRPN gene CpG island and exon 1. Identification of a strong DNase I hypersensitive site, specific for the paternal allele, and six evolutionarily conserved (human-mouse) sequences that are potential transcription-factor binding sites is consistent with this region defining the SNRPN gene promoter. These findings suggest that promoter elements at SNRPN play a key role in the initiation of imprint switching during spermatogenesis. We also identified three patients with sporadic PWS who have an imprinting mutation (IM) and no detectable mutation in the IC. An inherited 15q11-q13 mutation or a trans-factor gene mutation are unlikely; thus, the disease in these patients may arise from a developmental or stochastic failure to switch the maternal-to-paternal imprint during parental spermatogenesis. These studies allow a better understanding of a novel mechanism of human disease, since the epigenetic effect of an IM in the parental germ line determines the phenotypic effect in the patient.

TI	A 28-kb deletion spanning D15S63 (PW71) in five families: a rare neutral variant?
PG	1588-94
AB	Methylation analysis with probe PW71 (D15S63) is an established procedure to test patients suspected of having Prader-Willi syndrome or Angelman syndrome. Using this test, we have identified a 28-kb deletion spanning D15S63 in five independent families. Sequence analysis revealed identical breakpoints in all the families. The haplotype data are compatible with a common ancestral origin of the deletion in at least two families. The deletion was not found in 1, 000 unrelated controls. Although the deletion maps within the imprinting-center region, neither maternal nor paternal inheritance of the deletion appears to affect imprinting in proximal 15q. We conclude that the deletion is a rare neutral variant that can lead to false-positive results in the PW71-methylation test.

TI	Evidence from human oocytes for a genetic bottleneck in an mtDNA disease.
PG	769-75
AB	We have examined oocytes from a patient with Kearn-Sayre syndrome caused by mtDNA rearrangements. In mtDNA diseases, mutant and wild-type mtDNA frequently coexist in affected individuals (the condition of heteroplasmy). The proportion of mutant mtDNA transmitted from mother to offspring is variable because of a genetic bottleneck, and the &quot;dose&quot; of mutant mtDNA received influences the severity of the phenotype. The feasibility of prenatal diagnosis is critically dependent on the nature and timing of this bottleneck. Significant levels of rearranged mtDNA were detectable in the majority of the patient's oocytes, by use of multiplex PCR, with wide variation, in the levels of mutant and wild-type molecules, between individual oocytes. We also used length variation in a homopolymeric C tract, which is often heteroplasmic in normal controls, to identify founder subpopulations of mtDNAs in this patient's oocytes. We present direct evidence that the number of segregating units (n) is three to five orders of magnitude less than the number of mitochondria in the human female oocyte. In some cases, the best estimate of n may correspond to a single mitochondrion, if it is assumed that intergenerational transmission of mtDNA can be treated as a single sampling event. The bottleneck appears to contribute a major component of the variable transmission from mother to oocyte, in this patient and in a control. That this bottleneck had occurred by the time that oocytes were mature advances the prospects for prenatal diagnosis of mtDNA diseases.

TI	Imprinted expression of SNRPN in human preimplantation embryos.
PG	1009-14
AB	Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) are two clinically distinct neurogenetic disorders arising from a loss of expression of imprinted genes within the human chromosome region 15q11-q13. Recent evidence suggests that the SNRPN gene, which is defective in PWS, plays a central role in the imprinting-center regulation of the PWS/AS region. To increase our understanding of the regulation of expression of this imprinted gene, we have developed single-cell-sensitive procedures for the analysis of expression of the SNRPN gene during early human development. Transcripts of SNRPN were detected in human oocytes and at all stages of preimplantation development analyzed. Using embryos heterozygous for a polymorphism within the SNRPN gene, we showed that monoallelic expression from the paternal allele occurs by the 4-cell stage. Thus, the imprinting epigenetic information inherited in the gametes is recognized already in the preimplantation embryo. The demonstration of monoallelic expression in embryos means that efficient preimplantation diagnosis of PWS may be made by analysis for the presence or absence of SNRPN mRNA.

TI	Evidence for a Turner syndrome locus or loci at Xp11.2-p22.1.
PG	1757-66
AB	Turner syndrome is the complex human phenotype associated with complete or partial monosomy X. Principle features of Turner syndrome include short stature, ovarian failure, and a variety of other anatomic and physiological abnormalities, such as webbed neck, lymphedema, cardiovascular and renal anomalies, hypertension, and autoimmune thyroid disease. We studied 28 apparently nonmosaic subjects with partial deletions of Xp, in order to map loci responsible for various components of the Turner syndrome phenotype. Subjects were carefully evaluated for the presence or absence of Turner syndrome features, and their deletions were mapped by FISH with a panel of Xp markers. Using a statistical method to examine genotype/phenotype correlations, we mapped one or more Turner syndrome traits to a critical region in Xp11.2-p22.1. These traits included short stature, ovarian failure, high-arched palate, and autoimmune thyroid disease. The results are useful for genetic counseling of individuals with partial monosomy X. Study of additional subjects should refine the localization of Turner syndrome loci and provide a rational basis for exploration of candidate genes.

TI	Inherited interstitial duplications of proximal 15q: genotype-phenotype correlations.
PG	1342-52
AB	We present the cytogenetic, molecular cytogenetic, and molecular genetic results on 20 unrelated patients with an interstitial duplication of the proximal long arm of chromosome 15. Multiple probes showed that the Prader-Willi/Angelman critical region (PWACR) was included in the duplication in 4/20 patients, each ascertained with developmental delay. The duplication was also found in two affected but not in three unaffected sibs of one of these patients. All four probands had inherited their duplication from their mothers, three of whom were also affected. Two of the affected mothers also carried a maternally inherited duplication, whereas the duplication in the unaffected mother and in an unaffected grandmother was paternal in origin, raising the possibility of a parental-origin effect. The PWACR was not duplicated in the remaining 16 patients, of whom 4 were referred with developmental delay. In the 14 families for which parental samples were available, the duplication was inherited with equal frequency from a phenotypically normal parent, mother or father. Comparative genomic hybridization undertaken on two patients suggested that proximal 15q outside the PWACR was the origin of the duplicated material. The use of PWACR probes discriminates between a large group of duplications of no apparent clinical significance and a smaller group, in which a maternally derived PWACR duplication is consistently associated with developmental delay and speech difficulties but not with overt features of either Prader-Willi syndrome or Angelman syndrome.

TI	Balanced translocation 46,XY,t(2;15)(q37.2;q11.2) associated with atypical Prader-Willi syndrome.
PG	388-94
AB	The lack of normally active paternal genes in 15q11-q13, as an outcome of either a paternal deletion or maternal disomy, accounts for &gt;95% of all patients with Prader-Willi syndrome. Other mechanisms, including imprinting mutations and unbalanced translocations involving pat 15q11-q13, have been described elsewhere. In this study, we present a patient with a rare balanced, de novo translocation-46,XY,t(2;15)(q37.2;q11.2)-involving breakage within the Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome region of the paternal homologue, without an apparent deletion. The patient demonstrated several manifestations of the Prader-Willi syndrome but was clinically atypical. Cytogenetic and molecular studies of this case demonstrated the translocation breakpoint to be between SNRPN and IPW, with mRNA expression of SNRPN and PAR-5 but absence of IPW and PAR-1 expression. These results suggest that disruption of either IPW expression or a nearby gene by an upstream break may contribute to the Prader-Willi syndrome phenotype and that expression of SNRPN or other upstream genes is responsible for other aspects of the classical Prader-Willi syndrome phenotype.

TI	Molecular definition of the chromosome 7 deletion in Williams syndrome and parent-of-origin effects on growth.
PG	781-92
AB	Williams syndrome (WS) is a developmental disorder with variable phenotypic expression associated, in most cases, with a hemizygous deletion of part of chromosomal band 7q11.23 that includes the elastin gene (ELN). We have investigated the frequency and size of the deletions, determined the parental origin, and correlated the molecular results with the clinical findings in 65 WS patients. Hemizygosity at the ELN locus was established by typing of two intragenic polymorphisms, quantitative Southern analysis, and/or FISH. Polymorphic markers covering the deletion and flanking regions were ordered by a combination of genetic and physical mapping. Genotyping of WS patients and available parents for 13 polymorphisms revealed that of 65 clinically defined WS patients, 61 (94%) had a deletion of the ELN locus and were also hemizygous (or noninformative) at loci D7S489B, D7S2476, D7S613, D7S2472, and D7S1870. None of the four patients without ELN deletion was hemizygous at any of the polymorphic loci studied. All patients were heterozygous (or noninformative) for centromeric (D7S1816, D7S1483, and D7S653) and telomeric (D7S489A, D7S675, and D7S669) flanking loci. The genetic distance between the most-centromeric deleted locus, D7S489B, and the most-telomeric one, D7S1870, is 2 cM. The breakpoints cluster at approximately 1 cM to either side of ELN. In 39 families informative for parental origin, all deletions were de novo, and 18 were paternally and 21 maternally derived. Comparison of clinical data, collected in a standardized quantifiable format, revealed significantly more severe growth retardation and microcephaly in the maternal deletion group. An imprinted locus, silent on the paternal chromosome and contributing to statural growth, may be affected by the deletion.

TI	The impact of imprinting: Prader-Willi syndrome resulting from chromosome translocation, recombination, and nondisjunction.
PG	1008-16
AB	Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is most often the result of a deletion of bands q11.2-q13 of the paternally derived chromosome 15, but it also occurs either because of maternal uniparental disomy (UPD) of this region or, rarely, from a methylation imprinting defect. A significant number of cases are due to structural rearrangements of the pericentromeric region of chromosome 15. We report two cases of PWS with UPD in which there was a meiosis I nondisjunction error involving an altered chromosome 15 produced by both a translocation event between the heteromorphic satellite regions of chromosomes 14 and 15 and recombination. In both cases, high-resolution banding of the long arm was normal, and FISH of probes D15S11, SNRPN, D15S10, and GABRB3 indicated no loss of this material. Chromosome heteromorphism analysis showed that each patient had maternal heterodisomy of the chromosome 15 short arm, whereas PCR of microsatellites demonstrated allele-specific maternal isodisomy and heterodisomy of the long arm. SNRPN gene methylation analysis revealed only a maternal imprint in both patients. We suggest that the chromosome structural rearrangements, combined with recombination in these patients, disrupted normal segregation of an imprinted region, resulting in uniparental disomy and PWS.

TI	Gene structure, DNA methylation, and imprinted expression of the human SNRPN gene.
PG	335-46
AB	The human SNRPN (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N) gene is one of a gene family that encode proteins involved in pre-mRNA splicing and maps to the smallest deletion region involved in the Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) within chromosome 15q11-q13. Paternal only expression of SNRPN has previously been demonstrated by use of cell lines from PWS patients (maternal allele only) and Angelman syndrome (AS) patients (paternal allele only). We have characterized two previously unidentified 5' exons of the SNRPN gene and demonstrate that exons -1 and 0 are included in the full-length transcript. This gene is expressed in a wide range of somatic tissues and at high, approximately equal levels in all regions of the brain. Both the first exon of SNRPN (exon -1) and the putative transcription start site are embedded within a CpG island. This CpG island is extensively methylated on the repressed maternal allele and is unmethylated on the expressed paternal allele, in a wide range of fetal and adult somatic cells. This provides a quick and highly reliable diagnostic assay for PWS and AS, which is based on DNA-methylation analysis that has been tested on &gt; 100 patients in a variety of tissues. Conversely, several CpG sites approximately 22 kb downstream of the transcription start site in intron 5 are preferentially methylated on the expressed paternal allele in somatic tissues and male germ cells, whereas these same sites are unmethylated in fetal oocytes. These findings are consistent with a key role for DNA methylation in the imprinted inheritance and subsequent gene expression of the human SNRPN gene.

TI	Severe and mild mutations in cis for the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene, and description of five novel mutations in MTHFR.
PG	1268-75
AB	Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) catalyzes the synthesis of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, a methyl donor in the conversion of homocysteine to methionine. Patients with severe MTHFR deficiency have hyperhomocysteinemia, hypomethioninemia, and a range of neurological and vascular findings with a variable age at onset. We have previously described nine mutations in patients with severe MTHFR deficiency. A mild form of MTHFR deficiency, associated with a thermolabile enzyme, has been proposed as a genetic risk factor for cardiovascular disease and for neural tube defects. We have shown that a common missense mutation (an alanine-to-valine substitution) encodes this thermolabile variant. We now report an additional five mutations causing severe MTHFR deficiency and an analysis of genotype (alanine/valine status) and enzyme thermolability in 22 patients with this inborn error of metabolism. Six of these patients have four mutations in the MTHFR gene-two rare mutations causing severe deficiency and two mutations for the common alanine-to-valine mutation that results in thermolability. Even in severe MTHFR deficiency, the thermolabile variant is frequently observed, and there is a strong relationship between the presence of this variant and increased enzyme thermolability.

TI	Allele-specific replication of 15q11-q13 loci: a diagnostic test for detection of uniparental disomy.
PG	423-30
AB	Allele-specific replication differences have been observed in imprinted chromosomal regions. We have exploited this characteristic of an imprinted region by using FISH at D15S9 and SNRPN (small nuclear ribonucleo protein N) on interphase nuclei to distinguish between Angelman and Prader-Willi syndrome patient samples with uniparental disomy of chromosome 15q11-q13 (n = 11) from those with biparental inheritance (n = 13). The familial recurrence risks are low when the child has de novo uniparental disomy and may be as high as 50% when the child has biparental inheritance. The frequency of interphase cells with asynchronous replication was significantly lower in patients with uniparental disomy than in patients with biparental inheritance. Within the sample population of patients with biparental inheritance, those with altered methylation and presumably imprinting center mutations could not be distinguished from those with no currently detectable mutation. This test is cost effective because it is performed on interphase cells from the same hybridized cytological preparation in which a deletion is excluded, and additional specimens are not required to determine the parental origin of chromosome 15.

TI	Testing parental imprinting in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus by the marker-association-segregation-chi 2 method.
PG	1080-7
AB	Among patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), an excess of DR3 and DR4 alleles is classically described when compared with the general population. In addition, an excess of maternal DR3 and paternal DR4 alleles among patients (DR3DR4) is observed. In order to explain these observations, two alternative hypotheses can be tested: maternal effect and parental imprinting. Maternal effect has been tested and not rejected on a sample of 416 caucasians affected with IDDM. Under this hypothesis, the children of a DR3 mother are expected to have an earlier exposure and, hence, an earlier age at onset. However, we did not observe such a difference in age at onset in this data set. Using the marker-association-segregation-chi 2 method, we have tested four hypotheses with different parental effects of two susceptibility alleles, alpha 0 and beta 0, at two different closely linked loci. Under the hypothesis that best fitted the data, the probability of being affected depended on the parental inheritance of the susceptibility alleles, suggesting parental imprinting (i.e., differential role of maternal and paternal allele), without evidence for a cis-trans effect. We conclude that parental imprinting on a specific allelic combination may explain the observations on the HLA genotypes of the patients and their relatives.

TI	AGT genetic variation, plasma AGT, and blood pressure: An analysis of the Utah Genetic Reference Project pedigrees.
PG	917-23
AB	BACKGROUND: Much remains unknown about the genetic factors that contribute to essential hypertension. The Utah Genetic Reference Project (UGRP) large pedigree collection provides new opportunities to study quantitative relationships between genetic variation, endophenotypes, and blood pressure. METHODS: We analyzed the relationship between common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes spanning the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene and promoter region, plasma AGT levels, and systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in 424 individuals from 41 two-generation UGRP families. RESULTS: Plasma AGT levels are significantly correlated among UGRP family members. Correlations are higher for males than for females. Parent-offspring correlations for plasma AGT (0.30) are higher than those for SBP (0.26) and DBP (0.17) (all P values &lt;0.01). The additive heritability (h(2)) for plasma AGT is high (0.74) and substantially exceeds heritability estimates for SBP (0.26) and DBP (0.16) (all P values &lt;0.01). Significant linkage (logarithm of the odds (LOD) &gt;3) is found between six AGT SNPs and plasma AGT. A model that utilizes three AGT haplotype groups produces the best LOD score (5.1) that exceeds the best single SNP LOD score (3.8). Plasma AGT and blood pressure were not significantly correlated. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma AGT levels demonstrate high heritability in 41 UGRP families. Locus-specific heritability estimates for AGT SNPs and haplotypes approach 67%, indicating that variation at AGT accounts for a large percentage of the heritability of plasma AGT. A three-way haplotype model outperforms single SNPs for quantitative linkage analysis to plasma AGT. In these predominantly normotensive individuals, plasma AGT did not correlate significantly with blood pressure.

TI	Angiotensin converting enzyme gene insertion/deletion polymorphism, angiotensinogen gene polymorphisms, family history of hypertension, and childhood blood pressure.
PG	858-66
AB	Earlier epidemiologic studies have yielded inconsistent results on the extent and timing of the blood pressure (BP) increase in offspring of hypertensive parents. We hypothesized that a familial influence on the BP of the offspring exists from birth on, but becomes significant only later in childhood. We studied the influence of familial occurrence of hypertension on the BP of 3596 children aged 6 to 18 years during a 6-year follow-up. In addition, we examined the possible associations of BP variations with polymorphisms of two candidate genes for hypertension, ie, those coding for the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and those coding for angiotensinogen. A positive family history of hypertension was reflected as the occurrence of higher systolic BP values from the age of 9 years and upward among the females and from the age of 12 years and upward among the males. The mean differences in BP varied from 3.2 to 5.8 mm Hg (systolic) and 2.1 to 5.9 mm Hg (diastolic) between the female offspring of normotensive and hypertensive parents and grandparents. The systolic BP values were significantly higher among females with a hypertensive history in two generations in comparison with females from normotensive families. Among the male offspring of hypertensive and normotensive families, the BP differences were inconsistent. The deletion/deletion males had higher systolic BP values than those with other ACE genotypes. In contrast, variation at the angiotensinogen gene locus was not significantly associated with BP. We conclude that parental history of hypertension is a risk factor for high blood pressure among the offspring from the ages of 9 to 12 years and upward, and hypertension within two generations may enhance this effect. Although the common genetic variation of ACE may influence blood pressure in male children and adolescents, our data do not suggest a role for the common variation of the angiotensinogen gene as a BP regulator during childhood.

TI	Bilateral pheochromocytomas and congenital anomalies associated with a de novo germline mutation in the von Hippel-Lindau gene.
PG	E3
AB	A 12-year-old boy presented with severe hypertension, congenital microcephaly, severe hearing loss, developmental delay, cryptorchidism, and bilateral pheochromocytomas, without the phenotypic features of multiple endocrine neoplasia type II syndromes (MEN-2). Sequence analysis of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified gnomic DNA identified a missense mutation at nucleotide 451 of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene (A451G) that changes a codon for serine (AGT) to one for glycine (GGT) at amino acid position 80 (S80G). The sequence DNA analysis of the parents did not show a mutation in the VHL gene that was previously identified in their affected son. The observed constellation of microcephaly, deafness, cryptorchidism, developmental delay, hypertension, and bilateral pheochromocytoma in association with a VHL mutation A451G in a patient with negative family history has not previously been described in the literature. Knowledge that VHL mutation plays a critical role in sporadic pheochromocytoma should aid in the future diagnosis and treatment of this tumor. Genetic testing in known pheochromocytoma families is indicated to identify genetically abnormal subjects that carry the MEN-2, VHL, and glomus tumor gene mutations.

TI	Hunting for a hypoglycemia gene: severe neonatal hypoglycemia in a consanguineous family.
PG	40-6
AB	Hypoglycemia is a dreaded complication in diabetes mellitus patients treated with insulin, but is also a symptom that is observed in many disorders. In some metabolic diseases of early infancy, low blood glucose is the major presentation and the condition can become life-threatening. Such cases are often attributed to inherited hyperinsulinism. Vidnes and Oyasaeter [1977: Pediatr Res 11:943-949] described a son of consanguineous Pakistani parents with severe neonatal hypoglycemia and concluded that the patient probably suffered from an isolated glucagon deficiency. We have continued the investigation of this family, which now includes a hypoglycemic daughter and two healthy children. The original diagnosis is questioned because the second case of hypoglycemia can be explained by hyperinsulinism. We proceeded with microsatellite marker analysis for selected candidate genes under the assumption that the condition is autosomal recessive and that affected children are homozygous for a mutated allele. The four known genetic causes for inborn hyperinsulinism (mutations in the genes ABCC8, KCNJ11, GLUD1, and GCK) were excluded. Furthermore, we eliminated 13 candidate genes coding for transcription factors involved in pancreas development and differentiation. The analysis was also negative for the genes encoding insulin and glucagon, their receptors, and processing enzymes. The identification of a novel gene for persistent neonatal hypoglycemia can be expected to yield fundamental information about glucose homeostasis, and will therefore have implications for the understanding of diabetes as well.

TI	Polymorphism R25P in the gene encoding transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta1) is a newly identified risk factor for proliferative diabetic retinopathy.
PG	278-83
AB	Associations of the genetic polymorphisms in the promoter region and the signal peptide sequence of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta1) gene with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) were studied. A total of 245 Caucasian subjects comprised the two groups: NIDDM patients with PDR (n = 73) and NIDDM patients without PDR (n = 172). Allele frequencies of common TGF-beta1 polymorphisms (at positions -988C/A, -800G/A, -509C/T, +869T/C (L10P), and +915G/C (R25P)) were determined by PCR-based methodology. All polymorphisms were in strong linkage disequilibrium (P &lt; 10(-2)). Significantly higher frequencies of both the L allele and the R allele of the signal sequence polymorphisms in PDR subjects were found (after a correction for multiple comparisons, P(corr) &lt; 10(-2) and P(corr) &lt; 10(-4), respectively). Calculated odds ratios (ORs) for the LL and RR genotypes were 2.89 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.6-5.1) and 19.73 (95% CI, 2.6-146.8), respectively. No significant differences between groups were found for the -800G/A and -509C/T polymorphisms. The -988A allele was not represented in our sample. Multiple logistic regression identified age, diabetes duration, and R25P polymorphism as significant predictors (P = 0.002, P = 0.000003, and P = 0.007, respectively). The frequencies of genotype combinations of the -800G/A, -509C/T, L10P, and R25P TGF-beta(1) polymorphisms were significantly different between the PDR and non-PDR groups (chi(2) = 37.83, df = 20, P &lt; 10(-2)). The frequency of haplotype consisting of majority alleles was found significantly associated with PDR (P &lt; 0.03). The presented data indicate that the R25P polymorphisms in the TGF-beta1 gene could be regarded as a strong genetic risk factor for PDR.

TI	Familial interstitial 570 kbp deletion of the UBE3A gene region causing Angelman syndrome but not Prader-Willi syndrome.
PG	233-7
AB	Angelman syndrome (AS) is a disorder of psychomotor development caused by loss of function of the imprinted UBE3A gene. Since the paternal UBE3A copy is regularly silent, only mutations inactivating the maternal copy cause AS. Among 1,272 patients suspected of AS, we found one with an isolated deletion of the UBE3A gene on the maternally inherited chromosome. Initial DNA methylation testing at the SNURF-SNRPN locus in the patient revealed a normal pattern. The deletion was only detected through allelic loss at microsatellite loci D15S1506, D15S122, and D15S210, and confirmed with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) probes derived from the loci. It extends approximately 570 kilobase pairs (kbp), encompassing the UBE3A locus, and is flanked by loci PAR/SN and D15S986. The deletion is familial, and haplotype studies suggest that a great grandfather of the index patient already carried this deletion, and that it causes AS when inherited through the female germline but not Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) when paternally inherited. Our findings support the hypothesis that the functional loss of maternal UBE3A gene activity is sufficient to cause AS and that the deleted region does not contain genes or other structures that are involved in PWS. Finally, this case highlights that methylation tests can fail to detect some familial AS cases with a recurrence risk of 50%.

TI	Rearrangements of chromosome 15 in epilepsy.
PG	125-8
AB	A number of observations point to chromosome 15 as a good candidate to harbor genes involved in epilepsy. This hypothesis is supported by at least two lines of evidence: one is the finding that haploinsufficiency of the 15q11-q13 region, of maternal origin, is responsible for Angelman syndrome, one of the cardinal manifestations of which is epilepsy; the second is the observation that extra copies of this same genomic region, in the form of inv-dup(15) or intrachromosomal duplications, again of maternal origin, are usually associated with a severe neurological phenotype characterized by developmental delay and untreatable seizures. Therefore, both reduced and increased dosage of genes from the 15q11-q13 region, possibly subjected to maternal imprinting, appear to be causally involved in severe forms of epilepsy. We tested the hypothesis that submicroscopic rearrangements of this genomic region might be responsible for nonsyndromic epilepsy in both familial and sporadic forms. To this purpose, we genotyped 118 epileptic patients and their parents with closely spaced microsatellite markers mapped within the 15q11-q13 region. We report on the results of these studies and review the relevant literature.

TI	Possible dosage effect of maternally expressed genes on visual recognition memory in Prader-Willi syndrome.
PG	71-5
AB	Seventeen patients with Prader-Willi syndrome (7 with paternal deletion of chromosome 15q11-q13 and 10 with maternal uniparental disomy [UPD]), and 9 controls performed a computerized visual recognition task. A series of color digital photographs were presented; most were presented twice, but the remainder appeared only once. Photographs presented twice were separated in their presentation by either 0, 10, 30, 50 or 100 intervening photographs. Subjects indicated whether each photograph had been presented previously. This procedure was implemented twice, once using photographs of foods, and once using photographs of nonfood objects. As the number of intervening photographs between the first and second presentation increased, subjects were less likely to remember having seen the photograph before. Performance by UPD subjects was less affected by increasing the number of intervening photographs relative to the other two groups, suggesting they had superior visual recognition memory. This raises the possibility of a beneficial effect of having two copies maternally expressed genes on chromosome 15. UBE3A is suggested as a possible candidate for this effect.

TI	Fluorescence in situ hybridization detectable mosaicism for Angelman syndrome with biparental methylation.
PG	145-9
AB	We present a child with mild to moderate global developmental delay including severe speech impairment, inappropriate happy demeanor, wide-based gait, frequent ear infections with mild hearing loss, deep-set eyes, a wide mouth, widely-spaced teeth, normal head circumference, and no seizures. Results of peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosomal analysis with GTG banding were normal. However, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies showed mosaicism for a deletion of probes (D15S10 and SNRPN) from the Angelman syndrome (AS) critical region with approximately 40% of peripheral lymphocytes having the deletion. The deleted chromosome 15 also showed centromeric duplication, which was detected with a D15Z1 probe [46,XX, dic(15)(pter--&gt;q11.1::p11.2--&gt;q11. 1::q13--&gt;qter)]. The same duplication pattern was observed in 30% of the nuclei obtained from a buccal smear. Methylation studies using polymerase chain reaction with sodium bisulfite-treated DNA demonstrated a normal biparental methylation pattern. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case with AS and a FISH detectable deletion in a mosaic pattern. We recommend FISH studies for the detection of mosaicism in the patients with AS clinical findings even if results of the methylation studies are normal.

TI	Submicroscopic deletion in cousins with Prader-Willi syndrome causes a grandmatrilineal inheritance pattern: effects of imprinting.
PG	19-24
AB	The Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) critical region on 15q11-q13 is subject to imprinting. PWS becomes apparent when genes on the paternally inherited chromosome are not expressed. Familial PWS is rare. We report on a family in which a male and a female paternal first cousin both have PWS with cytogenetically normal karyotypes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis shows a submicroscopic deletion of SNRPN, but not the closely associated loci D15S10, D15S11, D15S63, and GABRB3. The cousins' fathers and two paternal aunts have the same deletion and are clinically normal. The grandmother of the cousins is deceased and not available for study, and their grandfather is not deleted for SNRPN. DNA methylation analysis of D15S63 is consistent with an abnormality of the imprinting center associated with PWS. &quot;Grandmatrilineal&quot; inheritance occurs when a woman with deletion of an imprinted, paternally expressed gene is at risk of having affected grandchildren through her sons. In this case, PWS does not become evident as long as the deletion is passed through the matrilineal line. This represents a unique inheritance pattern due to imprinting.

TI	Female with autistic disorder and monosomy X (Turner syndrome): parent-of-origin effect of the X chromosome.
PG	312-6
AB	We have ascertained and examined a patient with autistic disorder (AD) and monosomy X (Turner syndrome). The patient met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV)/International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) criteria for AD verified by the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised. The patient exhibited both social and verbal deficits and manifested the classical physical features associated with monosomy X. Skuse et al. [1997: Nature 387:705-708] reported three such cases of AD and monosomy X in their study of Turner syndrome and social cognition. They observed that monosomy X females with a maternally inherited X chromosome had reduced social cognition when compared with monosomy X females with a paternally inherited X chromosome. All three cases of AD and monosomy X were maternally inherited. Based on their data, they suggested that there was a gene for social cognition on the X chromosome that is imprinted and not expressed when the X chromosome is of maternal origin. Thus, we conducted parent-of-origin studies in our AD/monosomy X patient by genotyping X chromosome markers in the patient and her family. We found that the patient's X chromosome was of maternal origin. These findings represent the fourth documented case of maternal inheritance of AD and monosomy X and provide further support for the hypothesis that parent-of-origin of the X chromosome influences social cognition.

TI	The contribution of uniparental disomy to congenital development defects in children born to mothers at advanced childbearing age.
PG	454-60
AB	Most instances of maternal uniparental disomy (UPD) start as trisomies and, similar to the latter, show a significant increase of mean maternal age at delivery. To investigate the incidence of UPD in offspring of older mothers, we investigated two groups of patients: 1) 50 patients with unclassified developmental defects born to mothers 35 years or older at delivery were tested for UPD for all autosomes by means of microsatellite marker analysis; 2) The incidence of UPD versus other etiologies in correlation, with maternal age below versus 35 years and above at delivery was studied in patients investigated in our laboratory for maternal UPD 15 (Prader-Willi syndrome, PWS), paternal UPD 15 (Angelman syndrome, AS), and maternal UPD 7 (Silver-Russell syndrome, SRS). In group 1, four patients of 50 showed UPD for an autosome that clarified the etiology of their developmental problems: a 27-year-old woman with growth retardation and early puberty disclosed maternal heterodisomy 14; a 15-year-old girl revealed paternal isodisomy 15; a 6-year-old boy with suspected Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome was shown to have maternal heterodisomy 16 with additional mosaic partial trisomy 16(pter-p13); a 16-month-old girl with intrauterine growth retardation and a dysmorphic pattern revealed maternal heterodisomy 7. In group 2 the offspring of older mothers showed a clear increase of UPD compared with the mothers below 35 years at delivery. The binomial distribution gave P-values of 1.9 x 10(-10), 2.6 x 10(-4), and 0.01 for PWS, AS, and SRS, respectively. The correlation between increase of paternal UPD 15 with advanced maternal age might be explained by maternal non-disjunction leading to hypohaploid gamete (nullisomy) for chromosome 15 with subsequent or concomitant duplication of the paternal homologue (paternal isodisomy). The three UPD 15 AS cases with mothers older than 35 years at delivery revealed isodisomy, whereas the three cases from younger mothers showed heterodisomy. This study confirms the hypothesis that uniparental disomy is a not negligible cause of congenital developmental anomalies in children of older mothers.

TI	Molecular and clinical correlation study of Williams-Beuren syndrome: No evidence of molecular factors in the deletion region or imprinting affecting clinical outcome.
PG	34-43
AB	Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) results from a deletion of 7q11.23 in 90-95% of all clinically typical cases. Clinical manifestation can be variable and therefore, deletion size, inherited elastin (ELN) and LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1) alleles, gender, and parental origin of deletion have been investigated for associations with clinical outcome. In an analysis of 85 confirmed deletion cases, no statistically significant associations were found after Bonferroni's correction for multiple pairwise comparisons. Furthermore, the present data do not support presence of imprinted genes in the WBS common deletion despite a nonsignificant excess of maternal over paternal deletions. Maternal deletion cases were more likely to have a large head circumference in the present data. Also, pairwise comparisons between individual WBS clinical features have been conducted and revealed significant associations between (1) low birth weight and poor postnatal weight gain (&lt;10th percentile at the time of examination) and (2) transient infantile hypercalcemia and a stellate iris pattern. The latter association could indicate a common underlying etiology.

TI	Trisomy 16q in a female newborn with a de novo X;16 translocation and hypoplastic left heart.
PG	128-31
AB	We report a case of a newborn female with minor dysmorphic features and hypoplastic left heart. Chromosome studies showed that she was the carrier of an unbalanced translocation between the X-chromosome and chromosome 16, resulting in monosomy for Xp and trisomy for 16q. Only a handful of partial trisomy 16q cases have been reported in the literature among liveborns. The great majority of these cases have had significant anomalies in contrast to what has been seen in our patient. The absence of dysmorphic features and other significant abnormalities in this case (with the exception to the hypoplastic left heart), suggested that the inactivation of the derivative X chromosome might have played a role in the mild phenotype of this patient. Conventional cytogenetic studies were conducted in this patient in conjunction with fluorescent in situ hybridization studies, which were used to characterize the X inactivation pattern. The studies revealed that the X chromosome material in the derivative chromosome was inactive while the chromosome 16 derived material in the derivative chromosome was early replicating and active in all cells studied.

TI	Interstitial duplications of chromosome region 15q11q13: clinical and molecular characterization.
PG	82-9
AB	Duplications of chromosome region 15q11q13 often occur as a supernumerary chromosome 15. Less frequently they occur as interstitial duplications [dup(15)]. We describe the clinical and molecular characteristics of three patients with de novo dup(15). The patients, two males and one female (ages 3-21 years), had nonspecific findings that included autistic behavior, hypotonia, and variable degrees of mental retardation. The extent, orientation, and parental origin of the duplications were assessed by fluorescent in situ hybridization, microsatellite analyses, and methylation status at D15S63. Two patients had large direct duplications of 15q11q13 [dir dup(15)(q11q13)] that extended through the entire Angelman syndrome/Prader-Willi syndrome (AS/PWS) chromosomal region. Their proximal and distal breaks, at D15S541 or D15S9 and between D15S12 and D15S24, respectively, were comparable to those found in the common AS/PWS deletions. This suggests that duplications and deletions may be the reciprocal product of an unequal recombination event. These two duplications were maternally derived, but the origin of the chromatids involved in the unequal crossing over in meiosis differs. In one patient, the duplication originated from two different maternal chromosomes, while in the other patient it arose from the same maternal chromosome. The third patient had a much smaller duplication that involved only D15S11 and parental origin could not be determined. There was no obvious correlation between phenotype and extent of the duplication in these patients.

TI	Maternal disomy and Prader-Willi syndrome consistent with gamete complementation in a case of familial translocation (3;15) (p25;q11.2).
PG	134-9
AB	Maternal uniparental disomy (UPD) for chromosome 15 is responsible for an estimated 30% of cases of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). We report on an unusual case of maternal disomy 15 in PWS that is most consistent with adjacent-1 segregation of a paternal t(3;15)(p25;q11.2) with simultaneous maternal meiotic nondisjunction for chromosome 15. The patient (J.B.), a 17-year-old white male with PWS, was found to have 47 chromosomes with a supernumerary, paternal der(15) consisting of the short arm and the proximal long arm of chromosome 15, and distal chromosome arm 3p. The t(3;15) was present in the balanced state in the patient's father and a sister. Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis demonstrated that the PWS critical region resided on the derivative chromosome 3 and that there was no deletion of the PWS region on the normal pair of 15s present in J.B. Methylation analysis at exon alpha of the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein-associated polypeptide N (SNRPN) gene showed a pattern characteristic of only the maternal chromosome 15 in J.B. Maternal disomy was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction analysis of microsatellite repeats at the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor beta3 subunit (GABRB3) locus. A niece (B.B.) with 45 chromosomes and the derivative 3 but without the der(15) demonstrated a phenotype consistent with that reported for haploinsufficiency of distal 3 p. Uniparental disomy associated with unbalanced segregation of non-Robertsonian translocations has been reported previously but has not, to our knowledge, been observed in a case of PWS. Furthermore, our findings are best interpreted as true gamete complementation resulting in maternal UPD 15 and PWS.

TI	Characterization of a supernumerary small marker X chromosome in two females with similar phenotypes.
PG	45-50
AB	We describe two female patients mosaic for a cell line with an extra marker X chromosome in addition to a normal 46,XX cell line. To our knowledge, these cases are the first reports of females who had a cell line with a supernumerary marker X chromosome in addition to a normal cell line. They also had strikingly similar manifestations, including small hands and feet, minor facial anomalies, obesity, and mental retardation. The DNA content of the mar(X) chromosomes was investigated by fluorescent in situ hybridization using pericentromeric probes. The XIST gene, which is necessary for initiation of X-inactivation, was deleted from both marker chromosomes, suggesting that these chromosomes were not subject to inactivation. The short arm breakpoints of the mar(X)s were between the DNA markers DXS423E on Xp11.21 and UBE1 on Xp11.23. In Patient 1, mar(X) contained the androgen receptor gene and the DNA marker DXS1, both mapping to Xq11.2, whereas in Patient 2 the chromosome breakpoint was proximal to these markers. We suggest that the similar phenotypes of these patients may be due to the overexpression of genes in the common pericentromeric region of the X chromosome.

TI	Clinical spectrum and molecular diagnosis of Angelman and Prader-Willi syndrome patients with an imprinting mutation.
PG	195-206
AB	Recent studies have identified a new class of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) patients who have biparental inheritance, but neither the typical deletion nor uniparental disomy (UPD) or translocation. However, these patients have uniparental DNA methylation throughout 15q11-q13, and thus appear to have a mutation in the imprinting process for this region. Here we describe detailed clinical findings of five AS imprinting mutation patients (three families) and two PWS imprinting mutation patients (one new family). All these patients have essentially the classical clinical phenotype for the respective syndrome, except that the incidence of microcephaly is lower in imprinting mutation AS patients than in deletion AS patients. Furthermore, imprinting mutation AS and PWS patients do not typically have hypopigmentation, which is commonly found in patients with the usual large deletion. Molecular diagnosis of these cases is initially achieved by DNA methylation analyses of the DN34/ZNF127, PW71 (D15S63), and SNRPN loci. The latter two probes have clear advantages in the simple molecular diagnostic analysis of PWS and AS patients with an imprinting mutation, as has been found for typical deletion or UPD PWS and AS cases. With the recent finding of inherited microdeletions in PWS and AS imprinting mutation families, our studies define a new class of these two syndromes. The clinical and molecular identification of these PWS and AS patients has important genetic counseling consequences.

TI	Intersitial deletion of 20p: new candidate region for Hirschsprung disease and autism?
PG	298-304
AB	We describe a patient with Hirschsprung disease and autism. High-resolution karyotyping indicated that the patient has an interstitial deletion of 20p11.22-p11.23. Microsatellite analysis showed a deletion involving a 5-6 cM region from the maternally derived chromosome 20. The deleted region is proximal to, and does not overlap, the recently characterized Alagille syndrome region. This region of 20p has not yet been implicated in Hirschsprung disease or autism. However, this region contains several genes that could plausibly contribute to any phenotype that includes abnormal neural development.

TI	A 5-year-old white girl with Prader-Willi syndrome and a submicroscopic deletion of chromosome 15q11q13.
PG	137-41
AB	We report on a 5-year-old white girl with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and a submicroscopic deletion of 15q11q13 of approximately 100-200 kb in size. High resolution chromosome analysis was normal but fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), Southern hybridization, and microsatellite data from the 15q11q13 region demonstrated that the deletion was paternal in origin and included the SNRPN, PAR-5, and PAR-7 genes from the proximal to distal boundaries of the deletion segment. SNRPN and PW71B methylation studies showed an abnormal pattern consistent with the diagnosis of PWS and supported the presence of a paternal deletion of 15q11q13 or an imprinting mutation. Biparental (normal) inheritance of PW71B (D15S63 locus) and a deletion of the SNRPN gene were observed by microsatellite, quantitative Southern hybridization, and/or FISH analyses. Our patient met the diagnostic criteria for PWS, but has no reported behavior problems, hyperphagia, or hypopigmentation. Our patient further supports SNRPN and possibly other genomic sequences which are deleted as the cause of the phenotype recognized in PWS patients.

TI	Alagille syndrome with interstitial 20p deletion derived from maternal ins(7;20).
PG	537-41
AB	We present a 6-year-old Chinese boy with Alagille syndrome and an interstitial 20p deletion, with a karyotype of 46,XY,der(20)dir ins(7;20)(q11.23;p11.23p12.2 or p12.2p13)mat. He had a peculiar face and suffered from congenital heart disease, growth retardation, severe cholestasis, hepatosplenomegaly, and impaired renal function. The karyotype of his mother showed a balanced translocation, 46,XX,dir ins(7;20)(q11.23; p11.23p12.2 or p12.2p13), and her phenotype was normal. His dead elder brother was highly suspected as another victim of Alagille syndrome. The findings in the present family suggested that if Alagille syndrome is a single gene defect, the putative gene responsible for the syndrome would not be located at the insertion breakpoints but located within the deletion extent.

TI	Asymmetry of methylation with FMR-1 full mutation in two 45,X/46,XX mosaic females associated with normal intellect.
PG	507-8
AB	The full FMR-1 mutation is known to cause the fragile X syndrome [Fra(X)], but variable expression in females, including normal to deficient intellect, may be related to random X-inactivation (lyonization). We have evaluated 2 mosaic 45,X/46,XX females who are cytogenetically fra(X) positive, have an FMR-1 full mutation, and are of normal intellect. There were 50% fra(X) chromosomes in the 45,X cells of one of the females; this has not been reported previously. In both patients, there was a strong asymmetry of FMR-1 methylation with the normal allele being totally or 90% unmethylated and the mutant allele being similarly methylated. Thus, the apparent selective inactivation of the full mutant FMR-1 allele appears to have resulted in limited expression with normal intellect. The presence of the fra(X) chromosome in 45,X cells is unique; however, there may be no relationship to the asymmetric inactivation of the mutant allele which could be due to chance or a mechanism yet to be delineated.

TI	Mental retardation and Ullrich-Turner syndrome in cases with 45,X/46X,+mar: additional support for the loss of the X-inactivation center hypothesis.
PG	136-45
AB	Four cases having mosaicism for a small marker or ring [45,X/46,X,+mar or 45,X/46,X,+r] chromosome were ascertained following cytogenetic studies requested because of minor anomalies (cases 1, 3, and 4) and/or short stature (cases 2 and 4). While all 4 cases had traits typical of Ullrich-Turner syndrome (UTS), cases 1, 3, and 4 had manifestations not usually present in UTS, including unusual facial appearance, mental retardation/developmental delay (MR/DD) (cases 3 and 4), and syndactylies (case 1). The facial appearances of cases 1 and 3 were similar yet distinct from that of case 4. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), each of the markers in these 4 cases was identified as having been derived from an X chromosome. The level of mosaicism for the mar/r(X) cell line in these cases varied from 70% (case 1) to 16% (case 4) but was not apparently correlated with the presence of MR/DD. Replication studies demonstrated a probable early replication pattern for the mar/r(X) in cases 1, 3, and 4, while the marker in case 2 was apparently late replicating. To date, 41 individuals having mosaicism for a small mar/r(X) chromosome have been described. Interestingly, most of the 14 individuals having a presumedly active mar/r(X) demonstrated clinical findings atypical of UTS, including abnormal facial changes (11) and MR/DD (13). MR was noted most frequently in those cases having at least 50% mosaicism for the marker or ring. In contrast, atypical UTS facial appearance or MR/DD was not noted in 14 of the 16 cases with UTS who carried a probable late replicating marker or ring. In conclusion, although the phenotype of 45,X/46,X,mar/r(X) individuals appears to be influenced by the genetic content and degree of mosaicism for the mar/r(X), the most significant factor associated with MR/DD appears to be the activity status of the mar/r(X) chromosome. Thus, our 4 cases provide further support for the hypothesis that a lack of inactivation of a small mar/r(X) chromosome may be a factor leading to the MR and other phenotypic abnormalities seen in this subset of individuals having atypical UTS.

TI	X-inactivation pattern in an Ullrich-Turner syndrome patient with a small ring X and normal intelligence.
PG	490-3
AB	In a description of 8 girls who had Ullrich-Turner syndrome (UTS) with a small r(X), mental retardation, and other unusual findings, it was hypothesized that the distinctive phenotype was associated with the loss of the X inactivation center from the r(X) and lack of genetic inactivation of the ring [Van Dyke et al., 1992]. Here, we present a 17-year-old young woman with 45,X/46,X,r(X)(?p11q13) mosaicism, Ullrich-Turner syndrome, and normal intelligence. In situ hybridization with the X-centromere DNA probe DXZ1 (Oncor, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) was performed on previously G-banded slides, and the probe hybridized to the centromere regions of the normal X and the ring. The r(X) appears to be inactivated since a buccal smear demonstrated 5% Barr bodies. Furthermore, DAPI stain and FISH analysis with the X-centromere DNA probe DXZ1 was employed to distinguish the inactive X from the active X, and verified the presence of a sex chromatin mass in fibroblasts. These observations are consistent with the active-ring-X-and-mental-retardation hypothesis since the ring in this patient, although very small, appears to be normally inactivated and she has normal intelligence.

PG	41-4
AB	We present a girl with a mos45,X,-21, +der(21)t(X;21) (p21.3;p11.2)/46,X,t(X;21) (p21.3;p11.2) chromosome constitution. The ratio of these cells was 59/26 in phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated lymphocytes. The 45,X,der(21)t(Xp-;21p+) cells lacked an X inactivation center located at Xq13 on the derivative X chromosome; in these cells, the whole normal X chromosome and the distal part of Xp translocated onto the derivative chromosome 21 were early replicating. She had moderate mental retardation and other findings different from those that occur in the Ullrich-Turner syndrome. Her phenotype may be due to the functional excess of the distal part of Xp on the derivative 21 in 45,X,der(21)t(Xp-;21p+) cells; thus, this might be another type of the &quot;lack of X-inactivation&quot; syndrome.

TI	Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of a whole-arm translocation involving chromosomes 18 and 20 with alpha-satellite DNA probes: detection of a centromeric DNA break?
PG	340-4
AB	Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with alpha-satellite DNA probes was used to study whole-arm chromosome translocation products in a family in which the propositus was shown to have a monosomy 18p/trisomy 20p imbalance. By this approach, we show that the chromosome 18 alpha-satellite DNA block is split into 2 smaller units, whereas the chromosome 20 breakpoint is not included within the alpha-satellite DNA region. We found no evidence to suggest that this split alpha-satellite DNA region has reduced or impaired the function of the centromere or that it contributed to the phenotype of the propositus. The FISH technique critically demonstrated the involvement of a whole-arm translocation in this case and provided accurate identification of breakpoints, which was not possible with standard banding techniques.

TI	45,X/46,X,+r(X) can have a distinct phenotype different from Ullrich-Turner syndrome.
PG	39-43
AB	We present a patient with 45,X/46,X,+r(X) mosaicism and lack of inactivation of either the normal or the ring X in the 46,X,+r(X) cells. The patient has mental retardation, syndactyly, minor facial anomalies, and a congenital heart defect. Although most patients with 45,X/46,X,+r(X) have the Ullrich-Turner syndrome, 2 previously described patients with this karyotype also had a distinct phenotype consisting of severe mental retardation, syndactyly, and abnormal face. The unusually severe phenotype in these patients was thought to be due to lack of X-inactivation of the ring X chromosome. The findings in our patient support this hypothesis.

TI	Ullrich-Turner syndrome with a small ring X chromosome and presence of mental retardation.
PG	996-1005
AB	Since some patients with Ullrich-Turner syndrome (UTS) have mental retardation, we reviewed our experience to look for a high-risk subgroup. Among 190 UTS and gonadal dysgenesis patients with X chromosome abnormalities, 12 had mental retardation. All of the six (100%) with a small ring X were educable (EMI) or trainable mentally impaired (TMI) with more severe delay than expected in UTS. Among the 184 with other X abnormalities, only 6 had similar delays (2 from postnatal catastrophes), for a frequency of 3.3% mental retardation among those without a small ring X; only 2.2% of these had unexplained mental retardation. Polymerase chain reaction studies showed no Y-derived material in the 2 patients who were evaluated, and in situ hybridization confirmed X origin of the ring in the 6 subjects who were evaluated. We describe the phenotype of the 6 individuals with a small ring X, and an additional 2 patients with a small ring X who were identified outside the survey. The subjects with a small ring X comprised a clinically distinct subgroup which had EMI/TMI and shorter stature than expected in UTS. Seizures and a head circumference less than 10th centile were observed in half of the patients with a small ring X, and strabismus, epicanthus, and single palmar creases were present in more than half. A &quot;triangular&quot; face in childhood, pigmentary dysplasia, sacral dimple, and heart defects were also common. Neck webbing appeared to be less frequent than in 45,X. We hypothesize that the high risk of mental retardation in this form of the UTS results from lack of lyonization of the ring X due to loss of the X inactivation center. Excluding those with a small ring X, mental retardation is not significantly increased in patients with UTS.

PG	392-400
AB	Five matings to a dir ins (6;2)(q16;q31q33) carrier have produced a high frequency (42%) of offspring with unbalanced karyotypes. Five children have the derivative chromosome 2 resulting in del (2)(q31q33) and one individual received the derivative chromosome 6 leading to dup (2)(q31q33). The findings associated with the deletion include pre	and postnatal growth retardation, developmental delay, minor facial anomalies, seizures, complex structural heart defects, and limb deficiency. Autopsy of one individual showed complex brain malformations including hydrocephalus secondary to obstruction of the foramina of Monro, extensive heterotopias and polymicrogyria, and an unusual form of total anomalous pulmonary venous return. We compare the findings in these children to those of previously reported cases and construct an overview of the range of anomalies. Apparently, no other individual with dup (2)(q31q33) has been described. We compare the physical peculiarities of our patient with those of individuals with duplications of overlapping regions of 2q.

TI	Cytogenetic and molecular study of Angelman syndrome.
PG	314-8
AB	Six patients, including two sibs, with Angelman syndrome (AS; three females and three males, aged 11 to 18 years) were studied cytogenetically. Molecular analysis was also performed. Using high-resolution banding technique, we detected a microdeletion in the proximal region of chromosome 15q in four cases. The deleted segment was heterogenous between these patients, and the common deleted region appeared to be 15q11.2. Four patients with deleted 15q were all sporadic cases, whereas in the sib cases we could not detect a visible deletion in the long arm of chromosome 15. However, there was no clinical difference between sporadic cases and sib cases. Densitometric analysis of autoradiographic bands of Southern hybridization using two DNA segments, pML34 and pTD3-21, as probes demonstrated that two patients had only one copy for each of the probes. In the remaining four patients, including the sibs, two copies of each sequence were retained. The probes used here detect a molecular deletion in most Prader-Willi syndrome patients. Thus the segment causing AS is localized adjacent to the critical segment of Prader-Willi syndrome. There seemed to be heterogeneity for the molecular deletion within AS individuals.

TI	X;14 translocation:an exception to the critical region hypothesis on the human X-chromosome.
PG	87-96
AB	We report on a family in which an X;14 translocation has been identified. A phenotypically normal female, carrier of an apparently balanced X-autosome translocation t(X;14)(q22;q24.3) in all her cells and a small interstitial deletion of band 15q112 in some of her cells had 2 offspring. She represents a fifth case of balanced X-autosome translocation with the break point inside the postulated critical region of Xq(q13 q26) associated with fertility. The break point in this case is located in Xq22, the same band as in four previously published exceptional cases. In most of her cells, the normal X was inactivated. Her daughter, the proposita, has an unbalanced karyotype 46,X,der(X), t(X;14)(q22;q24.3)mat, del(15)(q11.1q11.3)mat. She is mildly retarded and has some Prader-Willi syndrome manifestations. She has two normal 14 chromosomes, der(X), and deletion 15q11.2. Her clinical abnormalities probably could be attributed to the deletions 15q and Xq rather than 14q duplication. In most of cells, der(X) was inactivated. We assume that spreading of inactivation was extended to the 14q segment on the derivative X. Late replication and gene dose studies support this view. Another daughter, who inherited the balanced X;14 translocation and not deletion 15 chromosome, is phenotypically normal.

TI	Genetic dosage compensation in a family with velo-cardio-facial/DiGeorge/22q11.2 deletion syndrome.
PG	548-54
LID	10.1002/ajmg.a.33861 [doi]
AB	Cytogenetic studies of a male child carrying the 22q11.2 deletion common in patients with velo-cardio-facial/DiGeorge syndrome showed an unexpected rearrangement of the 22q11.2 region in his normal appearing mother. The mother carried a 3 Mb deletion on one copy and a reciprocal, similar sized duplication on the other copy of chromosome 22q11.2 as shown by fluorescence in situ hybridization and array comparative genome hybridization analyses. The most parsimonious mechanism for the rearrangement is a mitotic non-allelic homologous recombination event in a cell in the early embryo soon after fertilization. The normal phenotype of the mother can be explained by the theory of genetic dosage compensation. This is the second documented case of such an event for this or any genomic disorder. This finding helps to reinforce this phenomenon in a human model, and has significant implications for recurrence risks for the dose-compensated mother.

TI	Evaluation of 64 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms as risk factors for neural tube defects in a large Irish study population.
PG	14-21
LID	10.1002/ajmg.a.33755 [doi]
AB	Individual studies of the genetics of neural tube defects (NTDs) contain results on a small number of genes in each report. To identify genetic risk factors for NTDs, we evaluated potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are biologically plausible risk factors for NTDs but that have never been investigated for an association with NTDs, examined SNPs that previously showed no association with NTDs in published studies, and tried to confirm previously reported associations in folate-related and non-folate-related genes. We investigated 64 SNPs in 34 genes for association with spina bifida in up to 558 case families (520 cases, 507 mothers, 457 fathers) and 994 controls in Ireland. Case-control and mother-control comparisons of genotype frequencies, tests of transmission disequilibrium, and log-linear regression models were used to calculate effect estimates. Spina bifida was associated with over-transmission of the LEPR (leptin receptor) rs1805134 minor C allele [genotype relative risk (GRR): 1.5; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0-2.1; P = 0.0264] and the COMT (catechol-O-methyltransferase) rs737865 major T allele (GRR: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.1-2.0; P = 0.0206). After correcting for multiple comparisons, these individual test P-values exceeded 0.05. Consistent with previous reports, spina bifida was associated with MTHFR 677C&gt;T, T (Brachyury) rs3127334, LEPR K109R, and PDGFRA promoter haplotype combinations. The associations between LEPR SNPs and spina bifida suggest a possible mechanism for the finding that obesity is a NTD risk factor. The association between a variant in COMT and spina bifida implicates methylation and epigenetics in NTDs.

TI	Marfan syndrome with neonatal progeroid syndrome-like lipodystrophy associated with a novel frameshift mutation at the 3' terminus of the FBN1-gene.
PG	2749-55
AB	We report on a 25-year-old woman with pronounced generalized lipodystrophy and a progeroid aspect since birth, who also had Marfan syndrome (MFS; fulfilling the Ghent criteria) with mild skeletal features, dilated aortic bulb, dural ectasia, bilateral subluxation of the lens, and severe myopia in addition to the severe generalized lipodystrophy. She lacked insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia, hepatic steatosis, and diabetes. Mutation analysis in the gene encoding fibrillin 1 (FBN1) revealed a novel de novo heterozygous deletion, c.8155_8156del2 in exon 64. The severe generalized lipodystrophy in this patient with progeroid features has not previously been described in other patients with MFS and FBN1 mutations. We did not find a mutation in genes known to be associated with congenital lipodystrophy (APGAT2, BSCL2, CAV1, PTRF-CAVIN, PPARG, LMNB2) or with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria (ZMPSTE24, LMNA/C). Other progeria syndromes were considered unlikely because premature greying, hypogonadism, and scleroderma-like skin disease were not present. Our patient shows striking similarity to two patients who have been published in this journal by O'Neill et al. [O'Neill et al. (2007); Am J Med Genet Part A 143A:1421-1430] with the diagnosis of neonatal progeroid syndrome (NPS). This condition also known as Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by accelerated aging and lipodystrophy from birth, poor postnatal weight gain, and characteristic facial features. The course is usually progressive with early lethality. However this entity seems heterogeneous. We suggest that our patient and the two similar cases described before represent a new entity, a subgroup of MFS with overlapping features to NPS syndrome.

TI	Phenotypic variability of a deletion and duplication 6q16.1 --&gt; q21 due to a paternal balanced ins(7;6)(p15;q16.1q21).
PG	2762-7
AB	Constitutional insertional translocations are rare findings in clinical cytogenetics. Here, we report on the unbalanced segregation of a balanced paternal insertional translocation ins(7;6)(p15;q16.1q21) to three children. Investigations by conventional karyotyping, FISH with locus-specific probes, microsatellite marker analysis, and SNP-array based copy number analysis revealed a direct orientation of the inserted segment, a size of 11.3 Mb, and breakpoints between rs4370337 and rs12660854 and rs12110990 and rs4946730 on 6q16.1 and 6q21, respectively, as well as within BAC clone RP11-182J2 on 7p15. A 17-year-old daughter inherited the der(6) chromosome and was affected by severe mental retardation, obesity, and minor anomalies. Two further children inherited the der(7) chromosome. A daughter shows an almost unremarkable phenotype and only minor features in neuropsychological testing at 19 years of age. Her 14-year-old half-brother demonstrates a mild delay in cognitive development most likely jointly caused by the chromosomal rearrangement and asphyxia during delivery. The patient with the deletion confirms the previously reported phenotype of severe mental retardation and obesity in patients with del(6)(q16.2), while both patients with partial trisomy for the same segment of chromosome 6 are further examples for a generally less severe phenotype associated with duplications than with deletions, and even for the recent insight that chromosomal aneusomies of several megabases may go without major clinical consequences.

TI	Pancreatic hypoplasia presenting with neonatal diabetes mellitus in association with congenital heart defect and developmental delay.
PG	340-6
AB	Congenital pancreatic hypoplasia is a rare cause of neonatal diabetes. We report on a series of three patients with pancreatic agenesis and congenital heart defects. All had abdominal scan evidence of pancreatic agenesis. In addition, Patient 1 had a ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus and pulmonary artery stenosis; Patient 2 had a truncus arteriosus and Patient 3 had tetralogy of Fallot. Two of the three patients have developmental delay. All three patients were isolated cases within the family. Investigations included sequencing of GCK, ABCC8, IPF1, NEUROD1, PTF1A, HNF1B, INS, ISL1, NGN3, HHEX, G6PC2, TCF7L2, SOX4, FOXP3 (Patients 1 and 2), GATA4 and KCNJ11 genes (all three patients), but no mutations were found. Genetic investigation to exclude paternal UPD 6, methylation aberrations and duplications of 6q24 was also negative in all three. 22q11 deletion was excluded in all three patients. Array CGH in Patient (1) showed a approximately 250 kb, paternally inherited duplication of chromosome 12q [arr cgh 12q24.33 (B35:CHR12:131808577-132057649++) pat], not found in the other two patients. Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus due to pancreatic hypoplasia with congenital heart defects has been reported before and may represent a distinct condition. We discuss this rare association and review previously reported literature.

TI	Clinical and molecular characterization of a large family with an interstitial 15q11q13 duplication.
PG	1933-41
AB	The clinical significance of an interstitial duplication of chromosome 15q11q13 is still not well documented. This abnormality has been associated with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) and varying degrees of mental retardation. The clinical variability appears to be influenced by the parental origin of the duplication. We present here the clinical evaluation and psychological assessment of the largest reported family with 12 carriers on three generations. Patients exhibit mental retardation, motor and visuo-motor skills impairments and adaptive functioning deficit without formal diagnosis of autism. There appeared to be evidence in the family of reduced penetrance in duplication of paternal origin. This familial 15q11q13 duplication was precisely investigated by cytogenetic and molecular techniques including fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), PCR analysis of microsatellite markers, array-comparative genomic hybridization analysis (Array-CGH) and semi-quantitative methylation-sensitive PCR. Results showed an inherited 15q11q13 duplication of maternal origin in 10 patients and of paternal origin in the remaining two. The size of the duplicated area was around 6 Mb with breakpoints in accordance with those previously reported. This report extends the clinical spectrum of the 15q11q13 duplication, and we recommend the investigation of 15q11q13 duplication not only in subjects with autistic spectrum disorder but also in patients with low normal intelligence and dyspraxia.

TI	Partial hexasomy for the Prader-Willi-Angelman syndrome critical region due to a maternally inherited large supernumerary marker chromosome.
PG	2034-8
AB	Extra copies of the Prader-Willi-Angelman syndrome critical region (PWASCR) have been shown to have detrimental phenotypic effects depending on the parent of origin. Hexasomy for the PWASCR is rare; only 6 cases have been described to date. We report on a 15-year-old girl referred for developmental delay and seizures with a mosaic tricentric small marker chromosome (SMC) 15 identified by routine G-banding chromosome studies. C-banding and FISH confirmed the presence of three chromosome 15 centromeres as well as four copies of the PWASCR on the SMC in approximately 60% of interphase cells. Microsatellite genotyping documented maternal inheritance of the SMC, and methylation-sensitive multiplex ligation-dependent PCR amplification (MS-MLPA) showed that the extra copies of the PWASCR contained on the marker chromosome bear a methylation pattern similar to a normal maternal chromosome, implying maternal inheritance. These findings are consistent with the patient's phenotype as paternal inheritance of such a marker chromosome is thought to be benign. However, this patient's phenotype is the mildest described to date and may be a result of mosaicism for the SMC.

Multiple repeat elements within the region mediate rearrangements, including interstitial duplications, interstitial triplications, and supernumerary isodicentric marker chromosomes, as well as the deletions that cause Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS). Recently, duplications of maternal origin concerning the same critical region have been implicated in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). We present a 6-month-old girl carrying a de novo duplication of maternal origin of the 15q11.2-q14 PWS/AS region (17.73 Mb in size) [46,XX,dup(15)(q11.2-q14)] detected with a high-resolution microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH). The patient is characterized by severe hypotonia, obesity, microstomia, long eyelashes, hirsutism, microretrognathia, short nose, severe psychomotor retardation, and multiple episodes of drug-resistant epileptic seizures, while her brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) documented partial corpus callosum dysplasia. In our patient the duplicated region is quite large extending beyond the Prader-Willi-Angelman critical region (PWACR), containing a number of genes that have been shown to be involved in ASD, exhibiting a severe phenotype, beyond the typical PWS/AS clinical manifestations. Reporting of similar well-characterized clinical cases with clearly delineated breakpoints of the duplicated region will clarify the contribution of specific genes to the phenotype.

TI	Evaluation of C677T and A1298C polymorphisms of the MTHFR gene as maternal risk factors for Down syndrome and congenital heart defects.
PG	2080-7
AB	Abnormal folate/homocysteine metabolism due to polymorphisms in genes involved in this pathway has been implicated as an etiologic factor in Down syndrome (DS). This case-control study aimed to evaluate the effect of maternal C677T and A1298C polymorphisms of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) as risk factors for the development of DS and congenital heart defects (CHD). The distribution of these genotypic variants was similar between mothers of children with DS (n = 239) and control mothers of normal children (n = 197), but the combined genotypes 677CT or TT and 1298AA increased the risk of having offspring with DS (OR = 1.99; 95% CI 1.11-3.55). The presence of the 677T allele in case mothers resulted in a 2.07-fold higher odds of CHD in the offspring (P &lt; 0.01). Among the 57 mothers of CHD-affected children with DS who carried the MTHFR 677CT or TT genotypes and did not have periconceptional folic acid intake, we observed a 2.26-fold increased odds (95% CI 1.25-4.09) of having any CHD-affected child with DS. Our results show that MTHFR genetic polymorphisms may be involved in the etiology of DS in our population when controlling for age. We noted a borderline significant association for the C677T polymorphism (P = 0.05). Maternal 677T allele may be associated with an increased occurrence of CHD in children with DS and we anticipate that women who carry this polymorphism would benefit from periconceptional folic acid supplementation.

TI	Molecular characterization of co-occurring Duchenne muscular dystrophy and X-linked oculo-facio-cardio-dental syndrome in a girl.
PG	1249-52
AB	Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an X-linked condition at the severe end of the spectrum of dystrophinopathies. Females with dystrophin mutations are at risk for cardiomyopathy, but are usually asymptomatic during childhood. However, some girls can exhibit features of Duchenne muscular dystrophy because of skewed X-inactivation, aneuploidy, or chromosomal rearrangement. Oculo-facio-cardio-dental syndrome is a rare X-linked disorder, lethal in males, that comprises microphthalmia, congenital cataracts, congenital heart defect, canine radiculomegaly, and digital anomalies. We report on a 7-year-old girl who was referred for muscular hypotonia, with clinical features of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, including elevated serum creatine phosphokinase, pseudohypertrophy of calf muscles, and muscle weakness, which became evident at 3 years of age. In addition, she had multiple congenital anomalies including atrial septal defect, cataracts, dental and digital anomalies, a constellation that suggested the diagnosis of oculo-facio-cardio-dental syndrome, a condition caused by mutations in BCOR. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis of muscle, and mutation analysis of DMD showed a maternally inherited deletion of exons 30-43, confirming the diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Studies of lymphocytes showed essentially complete skewing of X-inactivation. Mutation analysis of BCOR revealed a de novo frameshift mutation (c.1005delC). Thus, we report for the first time on an individual with the co-occurrence of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and oculo-facio-cardio-dental syndrome.

TI	Epidemiology of acephalus/acardius monozygotic twins: new insights into an epigenetic causal hypothesis.
PG	640-9
AB	Apart from a series of 10 acephalus/acardius (Ac/Ac) cases described from a pathological point of view, and the analysis of a review of published cases, we have been unable to find any epidemiological studies on Ac/Ac. Using data from the Spanish Collaborative Study of Congenital Malformations (ECEMC), we present here what seems to be the first epidemiological analysis of a consecutive series of the Ac/Ac type of monozygotic twins (MZT). Among a total of 2,281,604 consecutive births, 11 cases of Ac/Ac MZT were detected, giving a frequency of 0.48 per 100,000 births. However, we consider the period 1980-1985 as the baseline for our data, as in this period voluntary termination of pregnancy was not possible in Spain, and the frequency of Ac/Ac MZT was 0.49 per 100,000 births. Nonetheless, this frequency should be considered as a minimal estimation. The characteristics of these Ac/Ac cases indicate that they are more frequent in males (sex ratio 2.67). In addition, gestational age in Ac/Ac cases was 2.41 and 3.12 weeks lower than in malformed and control twins, respectively. Similarly, their mothers are 4.54 and 4.68 years younger than mothers of separate malformed and control twins, respectively. To understand the biological basis behind the occurrence of MZT in the context of recent observations, we evaluate the hypothesis that the epigenetic processes involved in the early cleavage of the embryo, and in blastocyst formation during development, may be implicated in twinning.

TI	Ovarian failure and dilated cardiomyopathy due to a novel lamin mutation.
PG	567-72
AB	Two unrelated young women presented with similar dysmorphic features including severe retrognathia, beaked nose, narrow chest, sloping shoulders, and an acrogeric appearance of the hands and feet. Neither had any evidence of skeletal myopathy, but both developed progressive dilated cardiomyopathy, both experienced premature ovarian failure, and both were found to have the same heterozygous novel missense mutation c.176T&gt;G in exon 1 of the LMNA gene, resulting in a leucine to arginine change at codon 59 (Leu59Arg). Mutations in the LMNA gene cause a variety of disorders including dilated cardiomyopathy, muscular dystrophy, familial lipodystrophy, progeria, atypical progeroid syndromes, and mandibuloacral dysplasia. Genotype-phenotype correlation has been reported for some of these conditions. Our patients are the only ones known to have the specific mutation Leu59Arg and also share a set of features not entirely consistent with any of the laminopathies previously described. A previously reported patient with an adjacent mutation (Ala57Pro) had &quot;atypical Werner syndrome&quot; with dilated cardiomyopathy, hypogonadism, and sloping shoulders. While each of these clinical features does occur in other laminopathy syndromes, these patients form a phenotypic cluster distinct from other laminopathies and clinically overlapping with Malouf syndrome. LMNA sequencing should be considered for patients presenting with dilated cardiomyopathy and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, including those previously diagnosed with Malouf syndrome.

TI	Further clinical delineation of the Borjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome in patients with PHF6 mutations.
PG	246-50
AB	Borjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome is an X-linked condition caused by PHF6 mutations. The classical description of males with this disorder includes severe intellectual disability with epilepsy, microcephaly, short stature, obesity, hypogonadism, and gynecomastia. We present three males with PHF6 mutations whose features included deep-set eyes, large ears, coarse face, tapering fingers, and truncal obesity. Unlike the original description of the syndrome; however, the males described herein had varying degrees of intellectual disability and hypogonadism, were of normal to tall stature, had normal to large head sizes, and did not have seizures. This departure from the usual clinical description of Borjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome is consistent with recent reports of males with mutations in PHF6. In addition, we describe the phenotype and X-inactivation pattern in two females heterozygous for PHF6 mutations, both of whom have mild features of the syndrome.

TI	Molecular characterization of a balanced rearrangement of chromosome 12 in two siblings with Noonan syndrome.
PG	2723-30
AB	The etiology of Noonan syndrome (NS) has been greatly elucidated with the discovery of the disease causative genes PTPN11, KRAS, SOS1, and RAF1, all involved in the RAS/MAPK-signaling cascade. Given that overall mutations are identified in about 70% of patients, identification of other NS associated genes remains a high priority to fully understand the etiopathogenesis of the condition. We report two affected siblings with an apparently balanced rearrangement of chromosome 12 ins(12)(q12p11.2p12.3) which segregates with the Noonan phenotype. The rearrangement was inherited from the phenotypically normal mother who had mosaicism for the derivative chromosome 12. There were no mutations of PTPN11, KRAS, SOS1, or RAF1 genes detected in the probands. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis we identified the three breakpoints involved at 12p12.3, 12p11.2, and 12q12. By microarray analysis, there were no gains or losses near the breakpoints. Neither, the PTPN11 or KRAS region on chromosome 12 was involved in the rearrangement. We hypothesize that other NS candidate gene(s) may be located in the breakpoint regions of chromosome 12 causing the Noonan phenotype in both of these children.

TI	A small and active ring X chromosome in a female with features of Kabuki syndrome.
PG	2816-21
AB	A ring X chromosome is found in about 6% of patients with Turner syndrome (TS), often with mosaicism for a 45,X cell line. Patients with this karyotype are reported to have a higher incidence of a more severe phenotype including mental retardation. In fact, some studies have shown a correlation between this severity and the presence or absence of an intact and functional X inactivation center (XIST). However, the phenotype of the individuals with r(X) cannot be entirely defined in terms of their X-inactivation patterns. Nevertheless, a small group of these patients have been described to manifest clinical features reminiscent of the Kabuki syndrome. Here we present a female patient with clinical features resembling Kabuki syndrome and a mos 45,X/46,X,r(X) karyotype. Methylation analyses of polymorphic alleles of the androgen receptor gene showed that both alleles were unmethylated suggesting an active ring chromosome. A specific X chromosome array CGH was performed estimating the size of the ring to be 17 Mb, lacking the XIST gene, and including some genes with possible implications in the phenotype of the patient.

TI	Cognition and behavior in pre-pubertal children with Prader-Willi syndrome and associations with sleep-related breathing disorders.
PG	3018-25
AB	Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is characterized by hypotonia, hypogonadism, obesity, and short stature. Neurobehavioral abnormalities, cognitive impairment, and sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD) are common. In the general population associations between neurobehavioral and cognitive abnormalities and SRBD have been found. We investigated cognition, behavior, and SRBD in children with PWS. Thirty-one pre-pubertal PWS children were evaluated (5 with paternal deletion, 14 with maternal disomy, 4 with imprinting-center mutation, and in 8 the defect was not specified). Cognition was assessed by Wechsler scale subtests, and behavior by parent-questionnaires. Polysomnography was performed. Cognition, behavior, and associations with SRBD were evaluated. All cognitive subtests were significantly below O SDS, with the lowest median (interquartile range) scores for the Block design subtest (-2.7 SDS (-3.0 to -0.3)). In 60%, verbal subtests were less affected than performance subtests. Parents reported problem behavior related to &quot;emotions/behavior not adapted to the social situation&quot; and &quot;insensitivity to social information.&quot; All children had SRBD, with an Apnea Hypopnea Index of 4.1/hr (2.6-7.9). One performance subtest score was significantly higher in children with better sleep efficiency, and daytime sleepiness was associated with more autistic-like social impairment. In contrast to our expectations, behavior was worse in children with better sleep-related breathing. In pre-pubertal PWS children, cognition is impaired. Neurobehavioral abnormalities are common, particularly autistic-like social impairment. Sleep efficiency was associated with better performance on one of the performance subtests, and neurobehavioral abnormalities were associated with daytime sleepiness. In contrast, we could not confirm a positive association of neurobehavioral abnormalities with SRBD in PWS.

TI	Molecular and clinical characterization of two patients with Prader-Willi syndrome and atypical deletions of proximal chromosome 15q.
PG	1955-62
AB	Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is caused by the disturbed expression of genes from the imprinted region of 15q11-q13, but the specific contributions of individual genes remain unknown. Most paternal PWS deletions are bracketed by recurrent breakpoints BP1 or BP2 and BP3. Atypical deletions are very rare. In the present work, we describe the molecular analysis of two patients with atypical deletions using microsatellite analysis, methylation-specific MLPA, and microarray CGH. A deletion of about 2 Mb in Patient 1 started at BP2 and ended in the middle of the typically deleted region within the UBE3A gene. The deletion in Patient 2 started 1.3 Mb distal from BP2 within the C15ORF2 gene, extended over 9.5 Mb, and ended within the AVEN gene in proximal 15q14. In Patient 1 both deletion breakpoints involved repetitive regions, which precluded cloning of the junction and pointed to non-allelic homologous recombination as a possible mechanism of this rearrangement. The breakpoints in Patient 2 were sequenced, and their structure suggested non-homologous end joining as the most likely cause of this deletion. The phenotype of both patients did not depart significantly from the typical clinical picture of PWS, although some symptoms in Patient 2 were also reminiscent of the phenotype of individuals with the recently described 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome. Our findings support previous observations of relatively mild phenotypic effects resulting from deletions that extend distally from the PWS region and observations of the modest effects of different types of genetic defects on the spectrum and severity of symptoms in PWS.

TI	Paternal uniparental isodisomy for chromosome 14 with mosaicism for a supernumerary marker chromosome 14.
PG	2165-71
AB	Uniparental disomy (UPD) describes the inheritance of two homologous chromosomes from a single parent. Disease phenotypes associated with UPD and chromosomal imprinting, rather than with mutations, include Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (paternal UPD11p), Angelman syndrome (paternal UPD15), Prader-Willi syndrome (maternal UPD15), and transient neonatal diabetes (paternal UPD6). Here we report on the first case of paternal uniparental isodisomy of chromosome 14 with a mosaicism for a supernumerary marker chromosome 14. The patient demonstrated a small thorax with a 'coat hanger' shape of the ribs, kyphoscoliosis, hypoplasia of the maxilla and mandible, a broad nasal bridge with anteverted nares, contractures of the wrists with ulnar deviation bilaterally, diastasis recti, and marked muscle hypotonia. Vertical skin creases under the chin and stippled epiphyses of the humeri were features not previously described in patients with paternal UPD14. This case illustrates that as with the finding of an isochromosome, a supernumerary marker chromosome can be an important clue to the presence of UPD14.

TI	Hyperhomocysteinemia and MTHFR polymorphisms in association with orofacial clefts and congenital heart defects: a meta-analysis.
PG	952-60
AB	Several studies have reported an association between hyperhomocysteinemia, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphisms and cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CLP), and congenital heart defects (CHDs). However, findings have been inconsistent. A meta-analysis was performed of published studies until September 2006 investigating these associations in both mothers and children. Homocysteine data were provided in two CLP and three CHD studies, and MTHFR polymorphisms were reported in ten CLP and eight CHD studies. Data were analyzed using the random effects model in the Cochrane Review Manager. The pooled odds ratio (OR) of maternal hyperhomocysteinemia was 2.3 (95% CI 0.4-11.9) for CLP, and 4.4 (2.6-7.3) for CHDs. The MTHFR C677T polymorphism and CLP showed pooled ORs of 1.2 (0.9-1.5) in mothers and 1.0 (0.9-1.2) in children, whereas these estimates for the A1298C polymorphism were 1.0 (0.7-1.2) in mothers and 0.9 (0.6-1.2) in children. The MTHFR C677T polymorphism in CHD studies demonstrated a pooled OR of 1.0 (0.8-1.3) for mothers and 1.1 (0.9-1.5) for children. Two studies investigating the maternal A1298C polymorphism in CHDs demonstrated a pooled OR of 1.2 (0.8-1.8). Only one CHD study reported an OR of 1.3 (0.8-2.1) for this polymorphism in children. In conclusion, this meta-analysis demonstrates that maternal hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor for CHDs. The MTHFR polymorphisms C677T and A1298C in both mothers and children are not independently associated with CLP or CHDs. Future studies should be performed to investigate the interactions between maternal hyperhomocysteinemia, B-vitamin intake, related polymorphisms and the risk of CLP and CHDs.

TI	Whole genome microarray analysis of gene expression in Prader-Willi syndrome.
PG	430-42
AB	Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is caused by loss of function of paternally expressed genes in the 15q11-q13 region and a paucity of data exists on transcriptome variation. To further characterize genetic alterations in this classic obesity syndrome using whole genome microarrays to analyze gene expression, microarray and quantitative RT-PCR analysis were performed using RNA isolated from lymphoblastoid cells from PWS male subjects (four with 15q11-q13 deletion and three with UPD) and three age and cognition matched nonsyndromic comparison males. Of more than 47,000 probes examined in the microarray, 23,383 were detectable and 323 had significantly different expression in the PWS lymphoblastoid cells relative to comparison cells, 14 of which were related to neurodevelopment and function. As expected, there was no evidence of expression of paternally expressed genes from the 15q11-q13 region (e.g., SNRPN) in the PWS cells. Alterations in expression of serotonin receptor genes (e.g., HTR2B) and genes involved in eating behavior and obesity (ADIPOR2, MC2R, HCRT, OXTR) were noted. Other genes of interest with reduced expression in PWS subjects included STAR (a key regulator of steroid synthesis) and SAG (an arrestin family member which desensitizes G-protein-coupled receptors). Quantitative RT-PCR for SAG, OXTR, STAR, HCRT, and HTR2B using RNA isolated from their lymphoblastoid cells and available brain tissue (frontal cortex) from separate individuals with PWS and control subjects and normalized to GAPD gene expression levels validated our microarray gene expression data. Our analysis identified previously unappreciated changes in gene expression which may contribute to the clinical manifestations seen in PWS.

TI	X-chromosome inactivation patterns in females with Prader-Willi syndrome.
PG	469-75
AB	Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder caused by loss of paternally expressed genes from the 15q11-q13 region generally due to a paternally-derived deletion of the 15q11-q13 region or maternal disomy 15 (UPD). Maternal disomy 15 is usually caused by maternal meiosis I non-disjunction associated with advanced maternal age and after fertilization with a normal sperm leading to trisomy 15, a lethal condition unless trisomy rescue occurs with loss of the paternal chromosome 15. To further characterize the pathogenesis of maternal disomy 15 process in PWS, the status of X-chromosome inactivation was calculated to determine whether non-random skewing of X-inactivation is present indicating a small pool of early embryonic cells. We studied X-chromosome inactivation in 25 females with PWS-UPD, 35 with PWS-deletion, and 50 controls (with similar means, medians, and age ranges) using the polymorphic androgen receptor (AR) gene assay. A significant positive correlation (r = 0.5, P = 0.01) was seen between X-chromosome inactivation and age for only the UPD group. Furthermore, a significantly increased level (P = 0.02) of extreme X-inactivation skewness (&gt;90%) was detected in our PWS-UPD group (24%) compared to controls (4%). This observation could indicate that trisomy 15 occurred at conceptus with trisomy rescue in early pregnancy leading to extreme skewness in several PWS-UPD subjects. Extreme X-inactivation skewness may also lead to additional risks for X-linked recessive disorders in PWS females with UPD and extreme X-chromosome skewness.

TI	Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) detects a large X chromosome deletion including FMR1, FMR2, and IDS in a female patient with mental retardation.
PG	1358-65
AB	Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) by array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is a new clinical test for the detection of well-characterized genomic disorders caused by chromosomal deletions and duplications that result in gene copy number variation (CNV). This powerful assay detects an abnormality in approximately 7-9% of patients with various clinical phenotypes, including mental retardation. We report here on the results found in a 6-year-old girl with mildly dysmorphic facies, obesity, and marked developmental delay. CMA was requested and showed a heterozygous loss in copy number with clones derived from the genomic region cytogenetically defined as Xq27.3-Xq28. This loss was not cytogenetically visible but was seen on FISH analysis with clones from the region. Further studies confirmed a loss of one copy each of the FMR1, FMR2, and IDS genes (which are mutated in Fragile X syndrome, FRAXE syndrome, and Hunter syndrome, respectively). Skewed X-inactivation has been previously reported in girls with deletions in this region and can lead to a combined Fragile X/Hunter syndrome phenotype in affected females. X-inactivation and iduronate 2-sulfatase (IDS) enzyme activity were therefore examined. X-inactivation was found to be random in the child's peripheral leukocytes, and IDS enzyme activity was approximately half of the normal value. This case demonstrates the utility of CMA both for detecting a submicroscopic chromosomal deletion and for suggesting further testing that could possibly lead to therapeutic options for patients with developmental delay.

TI	Prevalence of Angelman syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome in Estonian children: sister syndromes not equally represented.
PG	1936-43
AB	In 2000-2004, we performed a focused search for individuals with Angelman syndrome (AS) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) aiming to establish the prevalence data for the individuals born between 1984 and 2004 in Estonia. All persons with probable AS or PWS (n = 184) were studied using the DNA methylation test. Individuals with abnormal methylation were all further tested by chromosomal and FISH analysis, and if necessary for uniparental disomy and UBE3A gene mutation. Nineteen cases with abnormal methylation test result were identified. Seven of them had AS, including six (85.7%) due to 15q11-13 deletion and one paternal UPD15. Twelve subjects had PWS: 4 (33%) 15q11-13 deletions, 6 (50%) maternal UPD15, 1 unbalanced chromosome 14;15 translocation resulting in a chromosome 15pter-q13 deletion, and 1 Robertsonian 15q;15q translocation. The minimum livebirth prevalence in 1984-2004 for AS was 1:52,181 (95% CI 1:25,326-1:1,29,785) and for PWS 1:30,439 (95% CI 1:17,425-1:58,908). The livebirth prevalence of AS and PWS increased within this period, but the change was statistically significant only for PWS (P = 0.032), from expected 1:88,495 (95% CI 1:24,390-1:3,22,580) to expected 1:12,547 (95% CI 1:540-1:29,154). Six individuals with AS and 11 with PWS were alive on the prevalence day (January 1, 2005), indicating the point prevalence proportion of 1:56,112 (95% CI 1:25,780-1:1,52,899) and 1:30,606 (95% CI 1:17,105-1:61,311), respectively. Our results showing the birth prevalence of AS 1.7 times less than PWS challenge the opinion that both syndromes are equally represented, and are in line with the view that mutations in sperm and oocytes occur at different frequencies.

TI	Is there a higher incidence of maternal uniparental disomy 14 [upd(14)mat]? Detection of 10 new patients by methylation-specific PCR.
PG	2039-49
AB	Maternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 14 [upd(14)mat] is associated with a characteristic phenotype including pre	and postnatal growth retardation, muscular hypotonia, feeding problems, motor delay, small hands and feet, precocious puberty and truncal obesity. Patients with upd(14)mat show features overlapping with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and are probably underdiagnosed. Maternal upd(14) is frequently described in carriers of a Robertsonian translocation involving chromosome 14, but is also found in patients with a normal karyotype. Based on the above mentioned criteria we have identified six patients with upd(14)mat including two patients with a normal karyotype, one patient with a de novo Robertsonian translocation (14;21), one patient with a familial Robertsonian translocation (13;14) and two patients with a marker chromosome. In addition, we analyzed a cohort of 33 patients with low birth weight, feeding difficulties and consecutive obesity in whom PWS had been excluded by methylation analysis of SNRPN. In four of these patients (12%) we detected upd(14)mat. For rapid testing of upd(14)mat we analyzed the methylation status of the imprinted MEG3 locus. In conclusion, we recommend considering upd(14)mat in patients with low birth weight, growth retardation, neonatal feeding problems, muscular hypotonia, motor delay, precocious puberty and truncal obesity as well as in patients with a PWS like phenotype presenting with low birth weight, feeding difficulties and obesity.

TI	A case of mosaic supernumerary ring chromosome 15 with two copies of the segment 15p11.1-q14.
PG	1663-8
AB	Although supernumerary marker chromosomes derived from chromosome 15 (SMC(15)) are the most common marker chromosome in humans, ring SMC(15)s are rare. Here we report on a 16-month-old patient who has a ring SMC(15) with two copies of the segment 15p11.1-q14 region. She exhibits hypotonia, developmental delay, speech delay, microstomia, micrognathia, and other mild dysmorphic features. The ring was present in 22% of her peripheral blood lymphocyte cells. FISH study revealed that the ring was derived from chromosome 15, and had neither telomere sequence nor satellite III paracentromeric DNA. It had alpha satellite DNA, and two copies of the segment 15q11.2 to CTD 2125J1 (at 15q14, 2.2 Mbp telomeric of the common breakpoint 5). The ring-containing cells had four copies of 15p11.1-q14. The ring can be described as r(15)(::p11.1 --&gt; q14::q14 --&gt; p11.1::). Southern-blot analysis of the methylation pattern in the PW/AS critical region showed biparental inheritance, and the ring was maternally derived. This patient's phenotype was comparable to ring SMC(15) patients with three copies of the Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome (PWS/AS) critical region.

TI	Risks of human conotruncal heart defects associated with 32 single nucleotide polymorphisms of selected cardiovascular disease-related genes.
PG	21-6
AB	Investigating possible genetic polymorphisms and gene-environment interactions in the etiology of human conotruncal defects is a prudent research approach. In this study we explore gene-only and gene-environment effects of 32 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on conotruncal defect risks. The genes bearing these SNPs participate in one of five pathogenetic processes, homocysteine metabolism, coagulation, cell-cell interaction, inflammatory response, and blood pressure regulation. We used DNA samples and data from a California population-based case-control interview study (1987-1988 birth cohort). We employed a multilocus allele-specific hybridization assay. Allelic variants were determined by genotyping 155 infants with conotruncal defects (cases) and 437 infants without malformations (controls). Among the 32 SNPs, four were associated with odds ratios of 2 or more, and two with odds ratios of 0.5 or less. The four SNPs were F2 G20210A (prothrombin) with an odds ratio of 2.5 (95% confidence interval; 0.9-7.0), F7 promoter (-323) 10-bp del/ins with an odds ratio of 2.3 (0.8-6.8), ITGB3 leu33pro (platelet glycoprotein IIIa) with an odds ratio of 2.2 (0.9-5.7), and NPPA T2238C (atrial natriuretic precursor peptide) with an odds ratio of 2.9 (0.8-10.1). Two SNPs were associated with decreased risks: TNF (tumor necrosis factor, G (-376A)) and ADD1 gly460trp (alpha adducin) with odds ratios of 0.5 (0.1-2.3) and 0.5 (0.2-1.9), respectively. Analyses that investigated a potential gene-nutrient interaction between maternal periconceptional vitamin use and MTHFR genotypes did not indicate that the CT or TT genotype contributed to conotruncal defect risk in infants even in the absence of maternal use of multivitamin supplements with folic acid. Analyses that investigated a potential interaction on risk between NOS3 genes and maternal cigarette smoking, revealed some evidence for higher risk of conotruncal defects in infants whose mothers smoked cigarettes periconceptionally and who had one of the variant alleles for NOS3 A(-922G) or NOS3 glu298asp compared to those infants whose mothers did not smoke and whose genotypes were wild-type. Our results provide some support for involvement of genetic variation of biologically relevant candidate genes for some birth defects whose pathogenesis may be related to altered vascular tone or integrity. In particular, NPPA appears to be a good candidate gene for conotruncal defects and warrants further investigation.

TI	A unique patient with an Ullrich-Turner syndrome variant and mosaicism for a tiny r(X) and a partial proximal duplication 1q.
PG	303-6
AB	A 7-year old female with global cognitive impairment, short attention span, hyperactivity, impulsivity, and many compulsive behaviors was referred to the Genetics Clinic. Height was below the 5th centile and weight was at the 5th centile while head circumference was at the 50th centile. Minor anomalies included bluish sclera, low set and slightly posteriorly rotated auricles and a narrow palate with marked overbite. There was no significant family history. Chromosome analysis showed an unbalanced, mosaic female karyotype consisting of three cell lines: 46,X,+r[46]/45,X[37]/45,X,dup(1)(q11q21.3) [17] de novo.ish r(X)(DXZ1+,XIST+). Expression of XIST was observed in cDNA from the patient, suggesting the presence of an inactive X chromosome. Inactivation was confirmed by detection of a methylated allele of androgen receptor. This methylated allele was under-represented in undigested DNA, consistent with it arising from the r(X) which was present in only a minority of the patient's cells. The clinical phenotype of the tiny r(X) syndrome in our patient is obviously further influenced by mosaicism for the dup(1). Few cases of duplication of the proximal portion of chromosome 1 have been reported. Of these, the duplication either was present in all cells or involved different band regions so that a direct comparison would be difficult. However, the lower percentage of mosaicism for the dup(1) in our patient would suggest a milder influence on the clinical phenotype.

PG	27-32
AB	We reascertained a family in which first cousins were affected by Angelman syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome. A paracentric inversion of 15q11-q15 had previously been reported in this family but we show, using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), that the rearrangement segregating in this family is not a paracentric inversion but an inverted intrachromosomal insertion, inv ins(15)(q15q13q11.2). We also describe a further recombinant resulting in a maternal duplication of the Prader-Willi/Angelman critical region. This family illustrates the importance of distinguishing paracentric inversions from intrachromosomal insertions.

PG	243-8
AB	Through the nitric oxide (NO) production in the vascular system, the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS or NOS3) is a key enzyme in blood pressure regulation and atherosclerosis control. Several previous studies have suggested an important role of eNOS as a genetic risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. In this context, a genetic association study was carried out between two eNOS polymorphisms (the ecNOS4a/b VNTR and the G894T substitution) in a sample of 101 nuclear families having one affected offspring of ischemic heart disease (IHD). Transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) revealed partial associations between the VNTR marker and IHD in patients with a type A behavior pattern (TABP) (P = 0.0325, RR = 3.67) and for the haplotype formed by variant b of the VNTR and the T mutation of the G894T substitution in the IHD-affected subgroup having body mass index (BMI) lower than 25 (P = 0.0348, RR = 0.22). However, once multiple testing correction was applied, the associations became nonsignificant. A significant effect of the haplotype b-G increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) plasma levels was detected (P = 0.021 after Bonferroni correction). From a population point of view, frequencies found for G894T substitution in Spain were significantly different from other populations.

TI	Oculo-facio-cardio-dental syndrome: skewed X chromosome inactivation in mother and daughter suggest X-linked dominant Inheritance.
PG	261-6
AB	Oculo-facio-cardio-dental syndrome (OFCD) is an uncommon multiple congenital anomaly syndrome that is characterized by congenital cataracts, multiple minor facial dysmorphic features, congenital heart defects, and dental anomalies including canine radiculomegaly and oligodontia. Although most cases of OFCD are sporadic, since all reported OFCD individuals have been female, it has been suggested that OFCD is an X-linked dominant trait. Here we report two affected female patients with OFCD, a mother and daughter, who both had congenital cataracts, microphthalmia, characteristic dental anomalies, and typical facial dysmorphisms. These features were diagnostic for OFCD; thus, these cases represent the second documented instance of mother-to-daughter OFCD transmission. In addition to the clinical features typically seen in OFCD individuals, the affected daughter exhibited several additional congenital anomalies including intestinal malrotation and hypoplastic thumbs. Thus, these cases further define and expand the OFCD clinical phenotype. These two individuals also displayed a skewed pattern of X chromosome inactivation. Together, these data strongly support the hypothesis that OFCD is inherited as an X-linked dominant condition.

TI	Transient neonatal diabetes mellitus type 1.
PG	335-42
AB	Transient neonatal diabetes mellitus type 1 (TNDM1) is a rare but remarkable form of diabetes which presents in infancy, resolves in the first months of life, but then frequently recurs in later life. It is caused by overexpression of the imprinted genes PLAGL1 and HYMAI on human chromosome 6q24. The expression of these genes is normally restricted to the paternal allele as a result of maternal DNA methylation. TNDM1 is not associated with mutation of PLAGL1 or HYMAI, but rather with their overexpression via uniparental disomy, chromosome duplication, or relaxation of imprinting. Study of patients with TNDM1 has provided valuable insights into the causes of imprinting disorders. Over half of patients with maternal hypomethylation at the TNDM1 locus have additional hypomethylation of other maternally methylated imprinted genes throughout the genome, and the majority of these patients have mutations in the transcription factor ZFP57. TNDM1 with maternal hypomethylation has also been observed in patients conceived by assisted reproduction, and in discordant monozygotic twins. The variable clinical features of TNDM1 may be associated with variation in the nature of the underlying epigenetic and genetic mutations, and future study of this disorder is likely to yield further insights not only into the biological mechanisms of imprinting, but also into the contribution of epigenetics to diabetes.

TI	Maladaptive behavior differences in Prader-Willi syndrome due to paternal deletion versus maternal uniparental disomy.
PG	67-77
AB	Maladaptive behavior was compared across 23 people with Prader-Willi syndrome due to paternal deletion to 23 age	and gender-matched subjects with maternal uniparental disomy. Controlling for the higher IQs of the uniparental disomy group, deleted cases showed significantly higher maladaptive ratings on the Child Behavior Checklist's Internalizing, Externalizing, and Total domains as well as more symptom-related distress on the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale. Across both measures, deleted cases were more apt to skin-pick, bite their nails, hoard, overeat, sulk, and withdraw. A dampening of symptom severity is suggested in Prader-Willi syndrome cases due to maternal uniparental disomy. Findings are compared to Angelman syndrome, and possible genetic mechanisms are discussed, as are implications for Prader-Willi syndrome and obsessive-compulsive behaviors.

TI	Generalized lysosome-associated membrane protein-2 defect explains multisystem clinical involvement and allows leukocyte diagnostic screening in Danon disease.
PG	1309-20
AB	Danon disease, an X-linked dominant disorder, results from mutations in the lysosome-associated membrane protein-2 (LAMP2) gene and presents with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, and mental retardation. To investigate the effects of LAMP2 gene mutations on protein expression in different tissues, we screened LAMP2 gene mutations and LAMP-2 protein deficiency in the skeletal muscle of nine unrelated patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and vacuolar myopathy. We identified three novel families (including one affected mother) with unreported LAMP2 gene null mutations and LAMP-2 protein deficiency in skeletal and myocardial muscle, leukocytes, and fibroblasts. LAMP-2 protein deficiency was detectable in various tissues, including leukocytes, explaining the multisystem clinical involvement. Skeletal muscle immunopathology showed that mutant protein was not localized in the Golgi complex, vacuolar membranes expressed sarcolemmal-specific proteins, and the degree of muscle fiber vacuolization correlated with clinical muscle involvement. In our female patient, muscle histopathology and LAMP-2 protein analysis was inconclusive, indicating that diagnosis in females requires mutation identification. The random X-chromosome inactivation found in muscle and leukocytes excluded the possibility that selective involvement of some tissues in females is due to skewed X-chromosome inactivation. Therefore, biochemical analysis of leukocytes might be used for screening in male patients, but genetic screening is required in females.

TI	Transgenerational inheritance of the insulin-resistant phenotype in embryo-transferred intrauterine growth-restricted adult female rat offspring.
PG	E1270-9
AB	To determine mechanisms underlying the transgenerational presence of metabolic perturbations in the intrauterine growth-restricted second-generation adult females (F2 IUGR) despite normalizing the in utero metabolic environment, we examined in vivo glucose kinetics and in vitro skeletal muscle postinsulin receptor signaling after embryo transfer of first generation (F1 IUGR) to control maternal environment. Female F2 rats, procreated by F1 pre	and postnatally nutrient	and growth-restricted (IUGR) mothers but embryo transferred to gestate in control mothers, were compared with similarly gestating age	and sex-matched control (CON) F2 progeny. Although there were no differences in birth weight or postnatal growth patterns, the F2 IUGR had increased hepatic weight, fasting hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and unsuppressed hepatic glucose production, with no change in glucose futile cycling or clearance, compared with F2 CON. These hormonal and metabolic aberrations were associated with increased skeletal muscle total GLUT4 and pAkt concentrations but decreased plasma membrane-associated GLUT4, total pPKCzeta, and PKCzeta enzyme activity, with no change in total SHP2 and PTP1B concentrations in IUGR F2 compared with F2 CON. We conclude that transgenerational presence of aberrant glucose/insulin metabolism and skeletal muscle insulin signaling of the adult F2 IUGR female offspring is independent of the immediate intrauterine environment, supporting nutritionally induced heritable mechanisms contributing to the epidemic of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

TI	Epigenetics of programmed obesity: alteration in IUGR rat hepatic IGF1 mRNA expression and histone structure in rapid vs. delayed postnatal catch-up growth.
PG	G1023-9
AB	Maternal food restriction (FR) during pregnancy results in intrauterine growth-restricted (IUGR) offspring that show rapid catch-up growth and develop metabolic syndrome and adult obesity. However, continued nutrient restriction during nursing delays catch-up growth and prevents development of obesity. Epigenetic regulation of IGF1, which modulates growth and is synthesized and secreted by the liver, may play a role in the development of these morbidities. Control (AdLib) pregnant rats received ad libitum food through gestation and lactation, and FR dams were exposed to 50% food restriction from days 10 to 21. FR pups were nursed by either ad libitum-fed control dams (FR/AdLib) or FR dams (FR/FR). All pups were weaned to ad libitum feed. Maternal FR resulted in IUGR newborns with significantly lower liver weight and, with the use of chromatin immunoprecipitation, decreased dimethylation at H3K4 in the IGF1 region was observed. Obese adult FR/AdLib males had decreased dimethylation and increased trimethylation of H3K4 in the IGF1 region. This corresponded to an increase in mRNA expression of IGF1-A (134 +/	5%), IGF1-B (165 +/	6%), IGF1 exon 1 (149 +/	6%), and IGF1 exon 2 (146 +/	7%) in the FR/AdLib compared with the AdLib/AdLib control group. In contrast, nonobese FR/FR had significantly higher IGF1-B mRNA levels (147 +/	19%) than controls with no difference in IGF1-A, exon 1 or exon 2. Modulation of the rate of IUGR newborn catch-up growth may thus protect against IGF1 epigenetic modifications and, consequently, obesity and associated metabolic abnormalities.

TI	Fetal programming of pulmonary vascular dysfunction in mice: role of epigenetic mechanisms.
PG	H247-52
AB	Insults during the fetal period predispose the offspring to systemic cardiovascular disease, but little is known about the pulmonary circulation and the underlying mechanisms. Maternal undernutrition during pregnancy may represent a model to investigate underlying mechanisms, because it is associated with systemic vascular dysfunction in the offspring in animals and humans. In rats, restrictive diet during pregnancy (RDP) increases oxidative stress in the placenta. Oxygen species are known to induce epigenetic alterations and may cross the placental barrier. We hypothesized that RDP in mice induces pulmonary vascular dysfunction in the offspring that is related to an epigenetic mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we assessed pulmonary vascular function and lung DNA methylation in offspring of RDP and in control mice at the end of a 2-wk exposure to hypoxia. We found that endothelium-dependent pulmonary artery vasodilation in vitro was impaired and hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy in vivo were exaggerated in offspring of RDP. This pulmonary vascular dysfunction was associated with altered lung DNA methylation. Administration of the histone deacetylase inhibitors butyrate and trichostatin A to offspring of RDP normalized pulmonary DNA methylation and vascular function. Finally, administration of the nitroxide Tempol to the mother during RDP prevented vascular dysfunction and dysmethylation in the offspring. These findings demonstrate that in mice undernutrition during gestation induces pulmonary vascular dysfunction in the offspring by an epigenetic mechanism. A similar mechanism may be involved in the fetal programming of vascular dysfunction in humans.

TI	Deletion of the eNOS gene has a greater impact on the pulmonary circulation of male than female mice.
PG	L299-306
AB	Nitric oxide is involved in development and postnatal adaptation of the pulmonary circulation. This study aimed to determine whether genetic deletion of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) would lead to maldevelopment of the pulmonary arteries in fetal life, compromise adaptation to extrauterine life, and be associated with a pulmonary hypertensive phenotype in adult life and if any abnormalities were detected, were they sex dependent. Morphometric analyses were made on lung tissue from male and female fetal, newborn, 14-day-old, and adult endothelial NOS-deficient (eNOS-/-) or inducible NOS-deficient (iNOS-/-) and wild-type mice. Hemodynamic studies were carried out on adult mice with deletion of either eNOS or iNOS genes. We found that in eNOS-/	mice, lung development was normal in fetal, newborn, and adult lungs. Pulmonary arterial muscularity was greater than normal in both male and female eNOS-/	during fetal life and at birth, but the abnormality persisted only in male mice. Right ventricular hypertrophy was present in 14-day-old and adult male eNOS-/	but not in female mice. Adult male eNOS-/	mice had higher mean right ventricular and systemic pressures than female eNOS-/	mice (P &lt; 0.05). Thus deletion of the eNOS gene was associated with structural evidence of pulmonary hypertension in both sexes during fetal life, but pulmonary hypertension persisted only in the male. In neither sex did iNOS or neuronal NOS appear to compensate for the eNOS deletion. Adult iNOS-/	mice did not have structural or hemodynamic evidence of pulmonary hypertension. Possible compensatory mechanisms are discussed.

TI	Maternal obesity and fetal metabolic programming: a fertile epigenetic soil.
PG	R711-22
AB	The incidence of obesity and overweight has reached epidemic levels in the United States and developed countries worldwide. Even more alarming is the increasing prevalence of metabolic diseases in younger children and adolescents. Infants born to obese, overweight, and diabetic mothers (even when normal weight) have increased adiposity and are at increased risk of later metabolic disease. In addition to maternal glucose, hyperlipidemia and inflammation may contribute to the childhood obesity epidemic through fetal metabolic programming, the mechanisms of which are not well understood. Pregravid obesity, when combined with normal changes in maternal metabolism, may magnify increases in inflammation and blood lipids, which can have profound effects on the developing embryo and the fetus in utero. Fetal exposure to excess blood lipids, particularly saturated fatty acids, can activate proinflammatory pathways, which could impact substrate metabolism and mitochondrial function, as well as stem cell fate, all of which affect organ development and the response to the postnatal environment. Fetal and neonatal life are characterized by tremendous plasticity and the ability to respond to environmental factors (nutrients, oxygen, hormones) by altering gene expression levels via epigenetic modifications. Given that lipids act as both transcriptional activators and signaling molecules, excess fetal lipid exposure may regulate genes involved in lipid sensing and metabolism through epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic regulation of gene expression is characterized by covalent modifications to DNA and chromatin that alter gene expression independent of gene sequence. Epigenetic modifications can be maintained through positive and negative feedback loops, thereby creating stable changes in the expression of metabolic genes and their main transcriptional regulators. The purpose of this article is to review current literature on maternal-fetal lipid metabolism and maternal obesity outcomes and to suggest some potential mechanisms for fetal metabolic programming in key organ systems that regulate postnatal energy balance, with an emphasis on epigenetics and the intrauterine environment.

TI	A candidate gene study of obstructive sleep apnea in European Americans and African Americans.
PG	947-53
AB	RATIONALE: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is hypothesized to be influenced by genes within pathways involved with obesity, craniofacial development, inflammation, and ventilatory control. OBJECTIVES: We conducted the first candidate gene study of OSA using family data from European Americans and African Americans, selecting biologically plausible genes from within these pathways. METHODS: A total of 1,080 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 729 African Americans and 505 SNPs were genotyped in 694 European Americans. Coding for SNPs additively, association testing on the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) as a continuous trait, and OSA as a dichotomous trait (AHI &gt;/=15) was conducted using methods that account for familial correlations in models adjusted for age, age-squared, and sex, with and without body mass index. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In European Americans, variants within C-reactive protein (CRP) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) were associated with AHI (CRP: beta = 4.6; SE = 1.1; P = 0.0000402) (GDNF: beta = 4.3; SE = 1; P = 0.0000201) and with the dichotomous OSA trait (CRP: odds ratio = 2.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-3.9; P = 0.000170) (GDNF: odds ratio = 2; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-2.89; P = 0.0000433). In African Americans, rs9526240 within serotonin receptor 2a (HTR2A: odds ratio = 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-2.9; P = 0.00005233) was associated with OSA. CONCLUSIONS: This candidate gene analysis identified the potential role of genes operating through intermediate disease pathways to influence sleep apnea phenotypes, providing a framework for focusing future replication studies.

TI	Association between apoliprotein E gene polymorphism and hypercholesterolemic phenotype in Maracaibo, Zulia state, Venezuela.
PG	330-6
AB	Apoliprotein (Apo) E gene polymorphisms have been associated with high plasma lipids levels and cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to determine allelic and genotypic frequencies and to evaluate the associations of polymorphisms with hypercholesterolemic phenotypes in a patient population in Maracaibo, Zulia State. Two hundred and twenty-one patients with ages between 9 and 78 years old attending the Endocrine-Metabolic Center at the University of Zulia, Zulia, Venezuela, were recruited. The lipid profile was determined by enzymatic methods. ApoE polymorphisms were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. One hundred and thirty-three dyslipidemic and 88 patients with normal lipids profile were evaluated. The higher proportion of patients corresponded to hypercholesterolemia isolated (46.61%), followed by hypercholesterolemia combined with hypertriglyceridemia and low levels of high-density lipoprotein (21.8%). ApoE epsilon3 allele was the most frequent in the evaluated population (0.80), both in the control group (0.78) and in the dyslipidemic group (0.82), followed by the epsilon4 allele (0.12) for both groups and the epsilon2 allele with values of 0.10 and 0.06, for control and dyslipidemic group, respectively. The epsilon3epsilon3 and epsilon3epsilon4 genotypes were the most frequent in the population, with values of 62.89% and 22.17%, respectively. The genotype frequencies were 57.95% and 66.17% for epsilon3epsilon3; 23.86% and 21.05% for epsilon3epsilon4 in nondyslipidemicos and dyslipidemic patient groups, respectively. The epsilon4epsilon4 genotype was observed only in hypercholesterolemic patients. The homozygote epsilon2epsilon2 and heterozygote epsilon2epsilon3 genotypes were more frequent at the normal lipids profile group, consistent with diverse reports that indicate the association of the epsilon4 allele with elevated cholesterol levels and low cholesterol levels when the epsilon2 allele is present. ApoE polymorphism seems to be associated with variance in serum lipids levels in the population evaluated.

TI	Are nutrition-induced epigenetic changes the link between socioeconomic pathology and cardiovascular diseases?
PG	362-72
AB	The prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM 2) is decreasing in developed countries despite the increase in the percentage of subjects with obesity and other well-recognized cardiovascular risk factors. In contrast, the recent transition of the economic model experienced by developing countries, characterized by the adoption of a Western lifestyle, that we have named &quot;socioeconomic pathology,&quot; has led to an increase in the burden of CVD. It has been demonstrated that conventional cardiovascular risk factors in developed and developing countries are the same. Why then does the population of developing countries currently have a higher incidence of CVD than that of developed countries if they share the same risk factors? We have proposed the existence of a higher susceptibility to the development of systemic inflammation at low levels of abdominal obesity in the population of developing countries and the consequent endothelial dysfunction, insulin resistance, DM 2, and CVD. In contrast, an important percentage of obese people living in developed countries have a healthy phenotype and low risk of developing CVD and DM 2. Human epidemiologic studies and experimental dietary interventions in animal models have provided considerable evidence to suggest that nutritional imbalance and metabolic disturbances early in life may later have a persistent effect on an adult's health that may even be transmitted to the next generations. Epigenetic changes dependent on nutrition could be key in this evolutionary health behavior, acting as a buffering system, permitting the adaptation to environmental conditions by silencing or increasing the expression of certain genes.

TI	Possible pathomechanisms of sudden infant death syndrome: key role of chronic hypoxia, infection/inflammation states, cytokine irregularities, and metabolic trauma in genetically predisposed infants.
PG	517-46
AB	Chronic hypoxia, viral infections/bacterial toxins, inflammation states, biochemical disorders, and genetic abnormalities are the most likely trigger of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Autopsy studies have shown increased pulmonary density of macrophages and markedly more eosinophils in the lungs accompanied by increased T and B lymphocytes. The elevated levels of immunoglobulins, about 20% more muscle in the pulmonary arteries, increased airway smooth muscle cells, and increased fetal hemoglobin and erythropoietin are evidence of chronic hypoxia before death. Other abnormal findings included mucosal immune stimulation of the tracheal wall, duodenal mucosa, and palatine tonsils, and circulating interferon. Low normal or higher blood levels of cortisol often with petechiae on intrathoracic organs, depleted maternal IgG antibodies to endotoxin core (EndoCAb) and early IgM EndoCAb triggered, partial deletions of the C4 gene, and frequent IL-10-592*A polymorphism in SIDS victims as well as possible hypoxia-induced decreased production of antiinflammatory, antiimmune, and antifibrotic cytokine IL-10, may be responsible for the excessive reactions to otherwise harmless infections. In SIDS infants, during chronic hypoxia and times of infection/inflammation, several proinflammatory cytokines are released in large quantities, sometimes also representing a potential source of tissue damage if their production is not sufficiently well controlled, eg, by pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). These proinflammatory cytokines down-regulate gene expression of major cytochrome P-450 and/or other enzymes with the specific effects on mRNA levels, protein expression, and enzyme activity, thus affecting metabolism of several endogenous lipophilic substances, such as steroids, lipid-soluble vitamins, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, thromboxanes, and exogenous substances. In SIDS victims, chronic hypoxia, TNF-alpha and other inflammatory cytokines, and arachidonic acid (AA) as well as n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (FA), stimulated and/or augmented superoxide generation by polymorphonuclear leukocytes, which contributed to tissue damage. Chronic hypoxia, increased amounts of nonheme iron in the liver and adrenals of these infants, enhanced activity of CYP2C9 regarded as the functional source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in some endothelial cells, and nicotine accumulation in tissues also intensified production of ROS. These increased quantities of proinflammatory cytokines, ROS, AA, and nitric oxide (NO) also resulted in suppression of many CYP450 and other enzymes, eg, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), an enzyme important in the metabolism of FA during gluconeogenesis and glyceroneogenesis. PEPCK deficit found in SIDS infants (caused also by vitamin A deficiency) and eventually enhanced by PACAP lipolysis of adipocyte triglycerides resulted in an increased FA level in blood because of their impaired reesterification to triacylglycerol in adipocytes. In turn, the overproduction and release of FA into the blood of SIDS victims could lead to the metabolic syndrome and an early phase of type 2 diabetes. This is probably the reason for the secondary overexpression of the hepatic CYP2C8/9 content and activity reported in SIDS infants, which intensified AA metabolism. Pulmonary edema and petechial hemorrhages often present in SIDS victims may be the result of the vascular leak syndrome caused by IL-2 and IFN-alpha. Chronic hypoxia with the release of proinflammatory mediators IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6, and overloading of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems due to the narrowing airways and small pulmonary arteries of these children could also contribute to the development of these abnormalities. Moreover, chronic hypoxia of SIDS infants induced also production of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha), which stimulated synthesis and release of different growth factors by vascular endothelial cells and intensified subclinical inflammatory reactions in the central nervous system, perhaps potentiated also by PACAP and VIP gene mutations. These processes could lead to the development of brainstem gliosis and disorders in the release of neuromediators important for physiologic sleep regulation. All these changes as well as eventual PACAP abnormalities could result in disturbed homeostatic control of the cardiovascular and respiratory responses of SIDS victims, which, combined with the nicotine effects and metabolic trauma, finally lead to death in these often genetically predisposed children.

TI	[Quick diagnosis of Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes by means of methylation test by PCR].
PG	583-6
AB	OBJECTIVE: Angelman (AS) and Prader-Willi (PWS) syndromes are two different neurogenetic diseases caused by a deficiency of maternal (AS) or paternal (PWS) contributions of the region 15q11-13. Molecular diagnosis of these pathologies can be accomplished by several techniques: DNA polymorphism (microsatellite) analysis, cytogenetic techniques of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and methylation test by Southern blot (SB), with the latter being the most reliable. Recently, a new technique, based on the study of methylation through treatment with sodium bisulphite and subsequent polymerase chain reaction (PCR), has become available. We have evaluated this technique, comparing the results with those previously obtained by SB in a group of patients suspected of having PWS or AS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Genomic DNA from 70 patients with suspected PWS or AS was used. Methylation testing by SB was carried out using the probe PW71B labeled with radioactivity. For methylation testing by PCR the DNA was treated with sodium bisulphite and hydroquinone and PCR preformed using specific primers for the maternal and paternal alleles. RESULTS: Of the 70 patients studied by PCR, 45 were normal, 17 and 8 showed altered molecular patterns that were compatible with PWS and AS, respectively. The concordance with the results obtained previously with SB was 100%. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the reliability of this new technique is very good and it has advantages compared to SB, since it requires a smaller quantity of DNA and can be applied for diagnosis in newborns.

AB	The growth trends of Singapore children spanning 5 decades are reviewed, based on 8 anthropometric studies from 1957 till 2002. The heights of pre-school children and school age children appear to have optimised according to their genetic potential, but the weights and body mass indices of children still appear to be increasing from 6 to 18 years for both sexes, probably as a consequence of increasing affluence. This trend is reflected in the increasing obesity prevalence in school children over the past 30 years, and the concomitant increased morbidity associated with the metabolic syndrome, necessitates further research into the causes of obesity. Barker's hypothesis first suggested that changes in the intra-uterine environment can cause fetal adaptations which persist into adulthood, and are responsible for many chronic diseases of adult life. More recently, intense research in the field of epigenetics suggests that the environment can also influence the phenotype through gene expression, through modification of DNA methylation and histones which, in turn, influences gene expression. The challenge for the future is to determine if there are clear epigenetic changes, which are responsible for the increased prevalence of childhood and adolescent obesity, and whether these changes are transmitted through generations. Unravelling these epigenetic mechanisms may be the key to the prevention of obesity and the metabolic syndrome.

PG	389-96
AB	48 Tunisian people suffering from the IDDM auto-immune disease were compared to 35 control healthy persons for the polymorphisms of the complement BF, C2 and C4 proteins and genes, of the IgG (Gm allotypes) as well as of the TNF alpha and TCR C beta genes. Our study shows that the BFF1-C4A3-C4BQO and BFS-C4AQ0-C4B1 complotypes are associated to IDDM (RR of 2.97 and 3.07 respectively), as previously reported for other circummediterranean populations. The frequency of the Gm 21.28; 1.17; .. haplotype is increased, but not significantly, among the patients. The RFLP analysis reveals that the 2.65 kb SacI allelic restriction fragment of the C2 gene may be considered as a genetic marker of susceptibility to IDDM because its frequency raises to 0.206 among the patients vs 0.021 in the healthy individuals (p less than 0.001). The frequencies of the C4AQ0 and C4BQ0 alleles are more important among the IDDM patients than within the control sample, but the only C4BQ0 allele frequency is significantly increased. Both C4AQ0 and C4BQO result mainly from deletions. The frequencies of the allelic restriction fragments of the TNF alpha and TCRC beta genes are not significantly different among the patients and the controls. But the small sample size don't allow us to conclude definitively. It would be very interesting to extend the RFLP analysis to the TCR V beta and V alpha gene regions on more numerous samples.

TI	[Increased haemoglobin A2 levels in pseudoxanthoma elasticum].
PG	645-51
AB	BACKGROUND: Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is normally associated with mutations in the ABCC6 gene. A PXE phenotype without mutations in ABCC6 has been described in Greek and Italian patients presenting with beta thalassemia. We attempted to determine the incidence of beta thalassemia in a cohort of French patients with PXE. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty patients with PXE were included in the study. Laboratory examinations comprised hemoglobin electrophoresis, ABCC6 gene study and in some studies: mutation analysis, beta-globin gene. RESULTS: No cases of beta thalassemia were diagnosed in this cohort of French patients with PXE. However, 20% of the latter exhibited a significant but isolated (i.e. without microcytic anemia) increase of hemoglobin A2 (HbA2). Statistical comparisons showed no difference in terms of geographical origin or severity of PXE between patients with high levels of HbA2 and those with normal levels of HbA2 other than the extent of cutaneous involvement. Study of the beta-globin gene displayed mutations only in the two patients with the highest recorded levels of HbA2. ABCC6 + beta-globin digenism was ruled out of the pathogenesis of PXE. DISCUSSION: The PXE phenotype seen in some patients with beta thalassemia appears to be associated with epigenetic modification of ABCC6 transcription and depends specifically on the beta globin locus. Isolated increase in HbA2 is probably a laboratory marker for PXE. Here again, a functional epigenetic reaction between ABCC6 and the beta-globin locus was suspected. However, these reciprocal interactions are clearly unequal since the change in ABCC6 transcription occurring during the course of beta thalassaemia is responsible for a PXE phenotype while increased HbA2 during the course of PXE has no clinical consequences.

TI	[Nutritionnal epigenomics: consequences of unbalanced diets on epigenetics processes of programming during lifespan and between generations].
PG	2S19-28
AB	Epigenetic changes associated with DNA methylation and histone modifications leading to chromatin remodeling and regulation of gene expression underlie the developmental programming of obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and metabolic syndrome. This review focuses on converging data supporting the hypothesis that, in addition to &quot;thrifty genotype&quot; inheritance, individuals with obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome (MetS) with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases have suffered improper &quot;epigenetic programming&quot; during their fetal/postnatal development due to maternal inadequate nutrition and metabolic disturbances and also during their lifetime, that could even be transmitted to the next generation(s). We highlight the susceptibility of epigenetic mechanisms controlling gene expression to environmental influences due to their inherent malleability, emphasizing the participation of transposable elements and the potential role of imprinted genes during critical time windows in epigenetic programming, from the very beginning of development, throughout life. Increasing our understanding on epigenetic patterns significance and their role in development, evolution and adaptation and on small molecules (nutrients, drugs) that reverse epigenetic (in)activation should provide us with the means to &quot;unlock&quot; silenced (enhanced) genes, and to &quot;convert&quot; the obsolete human thrifty genotype into a &quot;squandering&quot; phenotype.

TI	Prader-Willi syndrome with an unusually large 15q deletion due to an unbalanced translocation t(4;15).
PG	267-73
AB	Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a neurobehavioral disorder caused by deletions in the 15q11-q13 region, by maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 15 or by imprinting defects. Structural rearrangements of chromosome 15 have been described in about 5% of the patients with typical or atypical PWS phenotype. An 8-year-old boy with a clinical diagnosis of PWS, severe neurodevelopmental delay, absence of speech and mental retardation was studied by cytogenetic and molecular techniques, and an unbalanced de novo karyotype 45,XY,der(4)t(4;15)(q35;q14),-15 was detected after GTG-banding. The patient was diagnosed by SNURF-SNRPN exon 1 methylation assay, and the extent of the deletions on chromosomes 4 and 15 was investigated by microsatellite analysis of markers located in 4qter and 15q13-q14 regions. The deletion of chromosome 4q was distal to D4S1652, and that of chromosome 15 was located between D15S1043 and D15S1010. Our patient's severely affected phenotype could be due to the extent of the deletion, larger than usually seen in PWS patients, although the unbalance of the derivative chromosome 4 cannot be ruled out as another possible cause. The breakpoint was located in the subtelomeric region, very close to the telomere, a region that has been described as having the lowest gene concentrations in the human genome.

AB	From among the many suspected patients with Prader-Willi (PWS) or Angelman (AS) syndromes received for diagnosis in a routine genetics laboratory, we present our protocol for the exclusion of a possible, rare imprinting centre (IC) defect. Deletion detection utilising two FISH probes-SNRPN within the IC, and another probe outside the IC, on the same suspension remaining from the cytogenetic harvest, provides a simple, quick and cost-effective system for exclusion of an IC defect, for patients with an abnormal methylation analysis.

TI	Origin of uniparental disomy 6: presentation of a new case and review on the literature.
PG	41-5
AB	Paternal uniparental disomy (UPD) of chromosome 6 has been reported several times in patients with (transient) neonatal diabetes mellitus ((T)NDM). Here we present our short tandem repeat typing results in a new patient with NDM, revealing a paternal isodisomy (UPiD). Summarising these data with those published previously on complete paternal (n=13) and maternal (n=2) UPD6, all cases show isodisomy. In general, several modes of UPD formation have been suggested: While a meiotic origin of UPD mainly results in a uniparental heterodisomy (UPhD), UPiD is probably the result of a post-zygotic mitotic error. This mode of formation consists of a mitotic nondisjunction in a disomic zygote, followed by either a trisomic rescue or a reduplication. Endoduplication in a monosomic zygote is another possible but less probable mechanism, taking into consideration that monosomic zygotes are not viable. The exclusive finding of isodisomy in case of chromosome 6 therefore gives strong evidence that segregational errors of this chromosome are mainly influenced by postzygotic factors. This hypothesis is supported by the observation of two cases with partial paternal UPiD6 originating from mitotic recombination events. The influence of mitotic segregational errors in UPD6 formation is in agreement with the results in trisomy/UPD of other chromosomes of the C group (7 and 8), and is in remarkable contrast to the findings in studies on the origin of the frequent aneuploidies. Multiple factors ensure normal segregation and we speculate that they vary in importance for each chromosome.

TI	Unbalanced translocation t(15;22) in &quot;severe&quot; Prader-Willi syndrome.
PG	125-30
AB	A 13-year-old girl with an unbalanced karyotype 45,XX,-15,der(22)t(15;22)(q13;q13.3) de novo had Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), (score 13.5), but with features of mental and physical retardation more severe than usually seen in PWS. The clinical diagnosis of PWS was confirmed by methylation analysis that showed absence of the paternal band. With GTG banding, the cytogenetic breakpoint on chromosome 15q13, with 15q14 intact, encompassed the PWS region, while the breakpoint on 22q was terminal. Investigations with FISH utilised ten different probes/combinations, namely SNRPN/PML, TUPLE1/22q13.3, TUPLE/ARSA, GABRB3, three YAC clones and one cosmid for specific regions within chromosome 15q, painting probes for the long arm of chromosomes 15 and 22 and a pantelomere probe. Deletion of SNRPN,TYAC 9 (at 15q11-12), TYAC19 (at 15q13) and GABRB3 (within the PWS locus), was evident on the derivative (22) chromosome, while TYAC10 (at 15q22), cos15-5 (at 15q22) and PML (15q22) were not deleted. On the der(22), 22q13.3 and ARSA were not deleted, but the most distal non specific pantelomeric probe was deleted. Thus, the severe phenotype could be attributable to deletion on chromosome 15q extending beyond q13 to q14, (further than the usual chromosome 15q deletion (q11-13) in PWS), or be related to loss of the very terminal 22q region (from ARSA to the pantelomere) or be due to genetic factors elsewhere in the genome.

PG	35-40
AB	Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHC) is a known risk factor for venous and arterial thrombosis. Thrombophilia workup includes the level of homocysteine and other related parameters such as: vitamin B(12), folic acid, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T genotype. As the levels of homocysteine, vitamin B(12), folic acid, and MTHFR C677T genotype are linked biochemically, we hypothesized that a statistical association will be found between them. The purpose of the present study was to assess the association between the four parameters in patients with a thrombotic event or recurrent fetal loss. The potential study population included 326 patients who were referred to the Thrombosis and Hemostasis Unit; 125 of these patients had at least one pathological test result of the four parameters. The correlations between homocysteine and vitamin B(12) as well as between homocysteine and folic acid were found to be weak (r = -0.236 and r = -0.209, respectively). No significant difference was revealed between the mean homocysteine level and the CC, CT, and TT MTHFR genotypes (p = 0.246). In conclusion, in the population studied, the association between homocysteine, vitamin B(12), folic acid, and MTHFR C677T is weak. The results raise doubt as to whether the current routine evaluation of HHC, as part of thrombophilia workup, truly reflects the increased risk of thrombosis.

TI	Effect of apolipoprotein B polymorphism on body mass index, serum protein and lipid profiles in children of Guangxi, China.
PG	411-20
AB	BACKGROUND: Some studies have demonstrated that genetic variance of apolipoprotein B (APOB) plays an important role in lipid metabolism in childhood. However, little information exists about the distribution and effect of the APOB polymorphism among the population from Guangxi, where populations have developed through complex interaction among various ethnic groups over the centuries. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of genetic polymorphisms at the APOB XbaI, EcoRI and MspI restriction sites with body mass index (BMI), serum protein and lipid profiles in children of Guangxi. METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from 200 healthy children from Guangxi. APOB XbaI, EcoRI and MspI genotypes were determined by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. BMI was evaluated. Fasting serum levels of total protein (TP), albumin (Alb), globulin (Glo), lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)], total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1) and apoB were measured. RESULTS: Subjects with X+ allele exhibited significantly higher BMI, and serum levels of Lp(a), TC, TG, LDL-C and apoB than those with X	allele (p&lt;0.05), whereas for TP and Alb the opposite were found (p&lt;0.05). E	/E	carriers had significantly higher Lp(a), TC, HDL-C, and apoA1 concentrations than did E + /E	or E + /E+ (p&lt;0.05), whereas for TP and Alb the opposite were found (p&lt;0.05). Higher Lp(a), TC, HDL-C, and lower TP, Alb concentrations were observed in individuals with E	allele as compared to E+ allele (p&lt;0.05). No significant differences in BMI, serum protein and lipid parameters were determined for the polymorphism study of the APOB MspI locus (p&gt;0 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: APOB XbaI and EcoRI restriction sites may serve as potential genetic markers affecting BMI, serum protein and lipid profiles in children from Guangxi. Living habits and diet should be modified, according to the genetic polymorphism of APOB. In addition, because the groups of rare allele carriers of XbaI and MspI polymorphisms are very small, the significance of the statistical analysis may be weak.

TI	Influence of the leptin G-2548A polymorphism on leptin levels and anthropometric measurements in healthy Spanish adolescents.
PG	335-9
AB	Polymorphisms in the leptin gene (LEP) have been associated with leptin levels and obesity in some studies in adults though this link has scarcely been investigated in children. In our study, we examined the relationship of the LEP G-2548A polymorphism with leptin levels, anthropometric variables and body composition in a population-based sample of pubescent children. Our study included 880 healthy schoolchildren (419 males and 461 females), 12-16 years of age. Plasma leptin levels were determined by ELISA. The LEP polymorphism was determined by allelic discrimination TaqMan assay. Male carriers of the AA genotype had significantly lower plasma leptin levels than GA (p &lt; 0.008) and GG (p &lt; 0.001) carriers and significantly lower mean hip circumference (HC) values than GG carriers (p = 0.04). In girls, leptin levels were also lower in A-allele carriers than in GG carriers, and BMI and HC were significantly lower in AA carriers as compared with GG carriers. In addition, the frequency of the A allele was significantly lower (chi(2): 4.58, p = 0.032) in the OW-obese than in the NW group. In conclusion, the LEP G-2548A polymorphism is associated with variations in leptin levels, BMI and HC in Spanish pubertal children, and evidence suggests a link between the G allele and presence of overweight in girls.

TI	Association study and mutation analysis of adiponectin shows association of variants in APM1 with complex obesity in women.
PG	492-501
AB	We performed an association study and mutation analysis of the adiponectin (APM1) gene to study its involvement in the development of obesity. We also studied the interaction with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). 223 obese women and 87 healthy female control subjects were used for association analysis. Mutation analysis was done on 95 morbidly obese adults and 123 overweight and obese children and adolescents. We selected 6 haplotype tagging SNPs in APM1 and the Pro12Ala variant (rs1805192) in PPARgamma to study the interaction. The G allele of rs2241766 was more common in controls (cases 10.8% vs. controls 18.4%, nominal p = 0.011; OR = 0.57, nominal p = 0.018). The rs2241766/rs3774261 haplotype was also associated with obesity (nominal p = 0.004). Only the latter association remained significant after controlling for the False Discovery Rate. Resequencing of exon 2, exon 3 and intron 2 in 95 individuals did not reveal any SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium with rs2241766. No interaction with the Pro12Ala variant in PPARgamma was detected. Mutation analysis of APM1 did not identify mutations. In conclusion, we found an association of an APM1 haplotype with obesity and found that APM1 mutations are not a common cause of monogenic obesity in our cohort.

TI	Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) genetic variation and early onset of non-fatal myocardial infarction.
PG	732-41
AB	Although Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein (CETP) mediates the transfer of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides between lipoprotein particles and thus plays a crucial role in reverse cholesterol transport, the association of variations in the CETP gene with acute myocardial infarction (MI) remains unclear. In this study we examined whether common genetic variation in the CETP gene is related to early-onset non-fatal MI risk in a population-based case-control study from western Washington State. Genotyping for the CETP -2708 G/A, -971 A/G, -629 A/C, Intron-I TaqI G/A and exon-14 A/G (I405V) SNPs was performed in 578 cases with first acute non-fatal MI and in 666 demographically similar controls, free of clinical cardiovascular disease, identified randomly from the community. In-person interviews and non-fasting blood specimens provided data on coronary heart disease risk factors. In men, there was little evidence for an association between single SNPs and MI risk, but in women the age	and race-adjusted OR was found to be significant in 4 out of the 5 CETP single variants. Haplotype analysis revealed two haplotypes associated with MI risk among men. As compared to men homozygous for the most common haplotype D (-2708 G, -971 G, -629 C, TaqI G and exon-14 A), the fully-adjusted multiplicative model identified haplotype G (-2708 G, -971 A, -629 A, TaqI G and exon-14 G) was associated with a 4.0-6.0-fold increased risk of MI for each additional copy; [95%CI 2.4-14.8] and haplotype B (-2708 G, -971 G, -629 A, TaqI A and exon-14 A) showed a significant decreased risk for early onset MI [OR = 0.18; 95%CI 0.04	0.75]. An evolutionary-based haplotype analysis indicated that the two haplotypes associated with the MI risk are most evolutionarily divergent from the other haplotypes. Variation at the CETP gene locus is associated with the risk of early-onset non-fatal MI. This association was found to be independent of HDL-C levels. These data and the sex-specific findings require confirmation in other populations.

TI	Screening of the endothelin1 gene (EDN1) in a cohort of patients with essential left ventricular hypertrophy.
PG	601-10
AB	Our objective was to analyse the role of endothelin1 gene (EDN1) variation in essential left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). We searched for EDN1 variants in 145 Spanish patients with an essential form of LVH (not secondary to hypertension, aortic stenosis, or any other disease that could explain the hypertrophy). The five EDN1 coding exons and 1.5 kilobases of the promoter region were analysed through single strand conformation analysis and direct sequencing. We found four nucleotide changes: -1224 C/A (promoter), -131 ins/del A (exon 1, 5'-non-translated sequence), A/G in codon 106 (exon 3, silent), and G/T in codon 198 (exon 5, lys198asn). To determine the association between these polymorphisms and cardiac hypertrophy, we compared the genotype frequencies from these 145 patients with 250 healthy controls. We found a higher frequency of patients homozygous for 198 lys (198 KK) (65% vs. 52%; p = 0.01; OR = 1.76) and for -1224 AA (73% vs. 66%; p = 0.19). Homozygotes for -1224 A + 198 K (AA+KK) were significantly more frequent in patients (62% vs. 45%; p = 0.0007; OR = 2.10; 95% CI = 1.35-3.25). The expression of the -1224 C/A and exon 5 K198N variants was analysed with cells in culture. These in vitro studies showed that these variations did not differ in their expression levels. In conclusion, our work has shown that EDN1 variation, and in particular homozygosity for the -1224A/198K haplotype, is associated with the risk of developing cardiac hypertrophy. However, these EDN1 variants do not affect in vitro gene expression.

TI	Conditional ETDT analysis of the human leukocyte antigen region in type 1 diabetes.
PG	215-21
AB	Several studies have indicated that additional genes in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region, other than the class II genes HLA-DQB1 and -DRB1 (the IDDM1 locus), may contribute to susceptibility and resistance to type 1 diabetes. The relative magnitude of these non	DR/DQ effects is uncertain and their map location is unknown owing to the extraordinary linkage disequilibrium that extends over the 3.5 Mb of the MHC. The homozygous parent test has been proposed as a method for detection of additional risk factors conditional on HLA-DQB1 and -DRB1. However, this method is inefficient since it uses only parents homozygous for the primary disease locus, the DQB1-DRB1 haplotype. To overcome this limitation, Conditional ETDT was used in the present report to test for association conditional on the DQB1-DRB1 haplotype, thereby allowing all parents to be included in the analysis. First, we confirm in UK and Sardinian type 1 diabetic families that allelic variation at HLA-DRB1 has a very significant effect on the association of DQB1 and vice versa. The Conditional ETDT was then applied to the HLA TNF (tumour necrosis factor) region and microsatellite marker D6S273 region, both of which have been reported to contribute to IDDM1 independent of the HLA-DQB1-DRB1 genes. We found no evidence for a major role for either of these two regions in IDDM1.

TI	Ring-X chromosomes: their cognitive and behavioural phenotype.
PG	295-305
AB	We tested the cognitive abilities and educational attainments of 47 patients with a ring X chromosome, to evaluate the extent to which these variables correlated with failure of r(X) inactivation and with mosaicism. We found possession of a r(X) chromosome was associated with an increased risk of significant learning difficulties, and with associated behavioural maladjustment, compared with 45,X Turner females. Nearly a third had been educated outside mainstream schools. The proportion of cells in peripheral blood containing an inactivated r(X) chromosome was negatively correlated with nonverbal IQ. The parental origin of the normal chromosome did not appear to affect adjustment or abilities. In a minority of r(X) cases associated with mental retardation, there had been a failure to inactivate the ring, due to loss of the XIST locus. However, failure of X-inactivation was not necessarily associated with a severe phenotype. The degree of impairment in IQ depended on the size of the active ring, and hence was proportionate to the number of (as yet unidentified) genes whose functional disomy affected brain development and functioning.

PG	277-93
AB	We studied 47 patients with a 45,X/46,X,r(X) karyotype to identify phenotypic differences between these patients and 45,X patients, and to determine whether these differences could be explained by the status of genes within the ring. Only 2 patients had the 'severe' r(X) phenotype, and both were consistent with this resulting from functional disomy of genes normally subject to X inactivation. A further 7 patients also carried active rings but these patients did not have a more severe phenotype than those whose rings were inactivated, probably because their rings were smaller and did not contain the (as yet unidentified) genes whose functional disomy is particularly damaging. Patients with a r(X) did not show clear physical differences when compared with a 45,X series, except for a possible reduction in the frequency of oedema in those whose r(X) had an Xq breakpoint distal to DXS128E, at Xq13.2. Thus some protection from oedema may be provided by the presence of two copies of Xq13.2.

TI	Combining genetic markers and clinical risk factors improves the risk assessment of impaired glucose metabolism.
PG	196-206
AB	BACKGROUND: Although several candidate gene polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), relatively few studies have assessed the ability of T2DM candidate genes to assess the risk of impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and T2DM beyond the information provided by clinical risk factors. OBJECTIVE: To test whether the inclusion of genetic markers in a regression model provides a better assessment of the risk of IFG, IGT, and T2DM than a model based only on non-genetic risk factors commonly assessed in clinical settings. METHODS: Subjects (n = 485; 213 parents, 272 offspring) from the Quebec Family Study, not known to haveT2DM, were measured for several risk factors and underwent an oral glucose tolerance test. Thirty-eight SNPs in 25 susceptibility/ candidate genes previously reported to be associated with T2DM were genotyped. In order to identify risk factors associated with IFG/IGT/T2DM, two logistic regression models were tested: a full model (FM) including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), systolic and diastolic blood pressure, smoking status, and the 38 SNPs; and a reduced model (RM), in which the SNPs were dropped, which allowed us to test the null-hypothesis that the markers are not associated with the risk of IFG/IGT/T2DM. Performances of the models were compared by using a likelihood ratio test and the receiver-operating characteristic curves (ROC).The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated from the ROC curve. RESULTS: The analyses showed that age (P &lt; 0.0001), BMI (P &lt; 0.0001), and six variants (IGF2BP2 rs4402960, P = 0.002; ADIPOQ+276 G&gt;T, P = 0.004; UCP2Ala55Val, P = 0.01; CDKN2AI2B rs3731201, P = 0.02; rs495490, P = 0.02, and rsl 0811661, P = 0.03) were significantly associated with the risk of IFG/IGT/T2DM. Dropping genetic markers from the analysis significantly reduced the fit of the model to the data (chi-square = 38.98, P &lt; 0.00001 contrasting RM to FM), suggesting that the genetic markers are significantly associated with the risk of IFG/IGT/T2DM. Furthermore, the AUC was higher for FM than for RM (0.85 (95% CI 0.81-0.89) versus 0.81 (95% CI 0.76-0.85), P = 0.004). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that combining genetic markers with traditional clinical risk factors has the potential to improve our ability to assess the risk of complex diseases such as T2DM.

TI	Genomic imprinting: concept and clinical consequences.
PG	4-11
AB	One of the major discoveries in modern genetics is the phenomenon of genomic, or parental, imprinting. The parent-of-origin effects seen after transmission of an imprinted gene from parents to their children do not follow the genetic rules postulated by Gregor Mendel. This has obvious consequences for genetic counselling. Aberrant imprinting can lead to a wide variety of clinical disorders ranging from the development of tumours to pronounced growth abnormalities and from mental retardation to developmental disorders of language or autism as seen in Turner's syndrome. Here we describe the basic principles of genomic imprinting and discuss a number of well-characterized clinical disorders associated with genomic imprinting.

TI	Association of apolipoprotein E and B polymorphisms with serum lipids.
PG	657-62
AB	Genetic polymorphism of apolipoprotein E (apoE) and the Xbal restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms (RFLP) of the gene for apolipoprotein B (apoB) have both been shown to be associated with plasma lipid concentration. We studied the combined effect of these gene polymorphisms on serum cholesterol concentrations in 300 subjects aged nine to 18 years. In three way ANOVA, there was a statistically significant interaction between the effects of apoE phenotype and gender on serum cholesterol (P = 0.009). Therefore, males and females were analysed separately by two way ANOVA: there was no interaction between the effects of apoE phenotype and apoB Xbal polymorphism in either gender. In females, there were independent effects of both the apoE phenotype (P = 0.020) and the apoB Xbal genotype (P = 0.037) on serum cholesterol, but in males these effects were not statistically significant. These data suggest that variations at the apolipoprotein B and E gene locus play a role in the determination of serum cholesterol concentration in young female Finns.

TI	Independent association of tumor necrosis factor polymorphism with type 1 diabetes susceptibility.
PG	76-85
AB	The contribution of SNPs in TNF genes to type 1 diabetes (T1D) is not well established and may be confounded by the linkage disequilibrium within the HLA genes. Seven SNPs in the TNF genes (TNFA and TNFB) were genotyped in a Korean cohort (398 T1D patients and 1422 nondiabetic controls), along with HLA DRB1, DQB1, and MICA (MHC class I chain-related genes). Among them, three SNPs (TNFB+318, TNFA-857, and TNFA-308) and two common TNF haplotypes showed significant association with the risk of T1D (P= 5 x 10(-3)-10(-5)). T1D patients were more often heterozygous for the alleles at the TNFB+318 (OR = 1.7, P= 10(-3)) and TNFA-308 (OR = 1.7, P &lt; 10(-5)) than were the controls. Genetic association analyses of the DRB1, DQB1, and MICA alleles with the risk of T1D revealed dramatic associations in several alleles as expected. Independent analyses to discern the genetic effects of TNF polymorphisms on the risk of T1D suggested that these genetic influences might be not totally dependent on the nearby HLA genes. Our results support the hypothesis that two susceptibility loci in the MHC (one in the HLA class II and another in the central MHC region) act epistatically to increase susceptibility to T1D.

TI	TNFa-e microsatellite, HLA-DRB1 and -DQB1 alleles and haplotypes in Brazilian patients presenting recently diagnosed type 1 diabetes mellitus.
PG	300-4
AB	TNF microsatellite and HLA class II polymorphisms were studied in 28 recently diagnosed Brazilian patients presenting type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and in 120 healthy controls. TNFa-e and HLA-DRB1/DQB1 alleles were identified using sets of sequence-specific primers. Compared to controls, the DRB1*03 and DQB1*02 allele groups, TNFa1 allele, and the TNFa4-b5-c1-d4-e3 and TNFa10-b5-c1-d4-e3 haplotypes were overrepresented in patients. TNF microsatellite together with HLA polymorphisms is associated with type 1 diabetes in Brazilian patients, corroborating the participation of the MHC genes in disease susceptibility.

TI	Timing of dietary estrogenic exposures and breast cancer risk.
PG	14-35
AB	The same dietary component, such as fat or phytochemicals in plant foods, can have an opposite effect on breast cancer risk if exposed in utero through a pregnant mother or at puberty. Dietary exposures during pregnancy often have similar effects on breast cancer risk among mothers and their female offspring. High fat intake and obesity are illustrative examples: excessive pregnancy weight gain that increases high birth weight is associated with increased breast cancer risk among mothers and daughters. High body weight during childhood is inversely linked to later breast cancer risk. The main reason why the age when dietary exposures occur determines their effect on breast cancer risk likely reflects the extensive programming of the mammary gland during fetal life and subsequent reprogramming at puberty and pregnancy. Programming is a series of epigenetic/transcriptional modifications in gene expression that can be influenced by changes in the hormonal environment induced, for example, by diet. Because epigenetic modifications are inherited by daughter cells, they can persist throughout life if they occur in mammary stem cells or uncommitted mammary myoepithelial or luminal progenitor cells. Our results indicate that the estrogen receptor (ER), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and the tumor suppressors BRCA1, p53, and caveolin-1 are among the genes affected by diet-induced alterations in programming/reprogramming. Consequently, mammary gland morphology may be altered in a manner that increases or reduces susceptibility to malignant transformation, including an increase/reduction in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival, or in the number of terminal end buds (TEBs) or pregnancy-induced mammary epithelial cells (PI-MECs) that are the sites where breast cancer is initiated. Thus, dietary exposures during pregnancy and puberty may play an important role in determining later risk by inducing epigenetic changes that modify vulnerability to breast cancer.

TI	5'-Insulin gene VNTR polymorphism is specific for type 1 diabetes: no association with celiac or Addison's disease.
PG	319-23
AB	The VNTR region located at the 5'-end of the insulin gene on chromosome 11p15.5 is linked to susceptibility to type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), and class I alleles have been associated with increased risk of disease, whereas class III alleles are considered to be protective. Although a potential effect on the expression level of thymic insulin and a consequent abnormal tolerance have been proposed as an explanation, it is still not clear whether the association is specific for T1DM or whether it is shared by other autoimmune disorders. To investigate the contribution of INS-VNTR to the genetic susceptibility to autoimmune disorders, we analyzed 102 autoantibody-positive T1DM patients, 59 patients with celiac disease (CD), and 57 patients with Addison's disease (ADD), as well as 111 unrelated healthy individuals from the general population. When analyzing the results, class I allele frequencies were 85.8% in the T1DM group, 77% among CD patients, 71% in the ADD group, and 76.1% in the general population. Association with increased risk was seen only in the T1DM group (pc = 0.015). Risk to T1DM was associated with the class I/class I homozygous genotype (RR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.03-3.6). In conclusion, INS-VNTR does not seem to be involved in the susceptibility to autoimmune diseases other than T1DM and can be considered a diabetes-specific locus.

TI	Tumor necrosis factor-alpha allele 2 shows an association with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in Latvians.
PG	357-61
AB	Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is one of the most common chronic diseases. It is an autoimmune disease. Genes contributing the most for development of IDDM are located on chromosome 6p21.3 in the region called the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). HLA-DQ8/DR4 and DQ2/DR3 have shown positive association with IDDM, while DQ6 has negative association with IDDM in most Caucasian populations. The location of the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) gene in the MHC suggests the role of TNF in the etiology of IDDM as an autoimmune disease. The TNF region contains several polymorphisms that are associated with different levels of TNF-alpha production and susceptibility to autoimmune and infectious diseases. Ninety-two Latvian IDDM patients corresponding to WHO diagnostic criteria and 107 unrelated age	and sex-matched healthy controls were analyzed for the frequency of TNF-alpha alleles to test the hypothesis that TNF-alpha is associated with IDDM. We found that TNF-alpha microsatellite allele 2 is associated with IDDM, 29/92 (32%), versus 14/107 (13%) in healthy controls. The test of the strongest association of the MICA A5 allele and TNF-alpha allele 2 with IDDM showed that both are independently associated with the disease.

TI	Late-onset mitochondrial DNA depletion: DNA copy number, multiple deletions, and compensation.
PG	607-17
AB	Through a report of 4 late-onset cases with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion, we address the specificity of the clinical entities associated with a very low residual amount of mtDNA. Three of the patients met the diagnostic criteria of Kearns Sayre syndrome, which has never been associated with mtDNA depletion. The fourth patient had an isolated skeletal myopathy. Deleted mtDNA molecules were found by long-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) only in the Kearns Sayre syndromes, which strengthens the clinical differences between the two types of patients. All patients had extremely low residual amounts of mtDNA as shown by Southern blot analysis. Using an original method based on competitive PCR, we were able to measure the number of mtDNA copies per diploid genome. These results demonstrated the severity of the depletion in the patients by comparison not only to normal controls but also to patients with mtDNA disorders. Despite the severity of the depletion, in situ hybridization using two mtDNA transcripts revealed a normal steady-state level of transcription. Such compensation provides clues to the striking contrast between the severity of mtDNA depletion and the late onset and slowly progressive disease.

TI	Clinical and molecular genetic spectrum of autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy due to mutations of the lamin A/C gene.
PG	170-80
AB	Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is characterized by early contractures of the elbows and Achilles tendons, slowly progressive muscle wasting and weakness, and life-threatening cardiomyopathy with conduction blocks. We recently identified LMNA encoding two nuclear envelope proteins, lamins A and C, to be implicated in the autosomal dominant form of EDMD. Here, we report on the variability of the phenotype and spectrum of LMNA mutations in 53 autosomal dominant EDMD patients (36 members of 6 families and 17 sporadic cases). Twelve of the 53 patients showed cardiac involvement exclusively, although the remaining 41 all showed muscle weakness and contractures. We were able to identify a common phenotype among the patients with skeletal muscle involvement, consisting of humeroperoneal wasting and weakness, scapular winging, rigidity of the spine, and elbow and Achilles tendon contractures. The disease course was generally slow, but we observed either a milder phenotype characterized by late onset and a mild degree of weakness and contractures or a more severe phenotype with early presentation and a rapidly progressive course in a few cases. Mutation analysis identified 18 mutations in LMNA (i.e., 1 nonsense mutation, 2 deletions of a codon, and 15 missense mutations). All the mutations were distributed between exons 1 and 9 in the region of LMNA that is common to lamins A and C. LMNA mutations arose de novo in 76% of the cases; 2 of these de novo mutations were typical hot spots, and 2 others were identified in 2 unrelated cases. There was no clear correlation between the phenotype and type or localization of the mutations within the gene. Moreover, a marked inter	and intra-familial variability in the clinical expression of LMNA mutations exists, ranging from patients expressing the full clinical picture of EDMD to those characterized only by cardiac involvement, which points toward a significant role of possible modifier genes in the course of this disease. In conclusion, the high proportion of de novo mutations together with the large spectrum of both LMNA mutations and the expression of the disease should now prompt screening for LMNA in familial and sporadic cases of both EDMD and dilated cardiomyopathy associated with conduction system disease.

TI	Clinical and functional characterisation of a novel TNFRSF1A c.605T&gt;A/V173D cleavage site mutation associated with tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic fever syndrome (TRAPS), cardiovascular complications and excellent response to etanercept treatment.
PG	1292-8
AB	OBJECTIVES: To study the clinical outcome, treatment response, T-cell subsets and functional consequences of a novel tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor type 1 (TNFRSF1A) mutation affecting the receptor cleavage site. METHODS: Patients with symptoms suggestive of tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) and 22 healthy controls (HC) were screened for mutations in the TNFRSF1A gene. Soluble TNFRSF1A and inflammatory cytokines were measured by ELISAs. TNFRSF1A shedding was examined by stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate followed by flow cytometric analysis (FACS). Apoptosis of PBMCs was studied by stimulation with TNFalpha in the presence of cycloheximide and annexin V staining. T cell phenotypes were monitored by FACS. RESULTS: TNFRSF1A sequencing disclosed a novel V173D/p.Val202Asp substitution encoded by exon 6 in one family, the c.194-14G&gt;A splice variant in another and the R92Q/p.Arg121Gln substitution in two families. Cardiovascular complications (lethal heart attack and peripheral arterial thrombosis) developed in two V173D patients. Subsequent etanercept treatment of the V173D carriers was highly effective over an 18-month follow-up period. Serum TNFRSF1A levels did not differ between TRAPS patients and HC, while TNFRSF1A cleavage from monocytes was significantly reduced in V173D and R92Q patients. TNFalpha-induced apoptosis of PBMCs and T-cell senescence were comparable between V173D patients and HC. CONCLUSIONS: The TNFRSF1A V173D cleavage site mutation may be associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular complications and shows a strong response to etanercept. T-cell senescence does not seem to have a pathogenetic role in affected patients.

TI	Drosophila nutrigenomics can provide clues to human gene-nutrient interactions.
PG	499-522
AB	Nutrigenomics refers to the complex effects of the nutritional environment on the genome, epigenome, and proteome of an organism. The diverse tissue	and organ-specific effects of diet include gene expression patterns, organization of the chromatin, and protein post-translational modifications. Long-term effects of diet range from obesity and associated diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease to increased or decreased longevity. Furthermore, the diet of the mother can potentially have long-term health impacts on the children, possibly through inherited diet-induced chromatin alterations. Drosophila is a unique and ideal model organism for conducting nutrigenomics research for numerous reasons. Drosophila, yeast, and Caenorhabditis elegans all have sophisticated genetics as well as sequenced genomes, and researchers working with all three organisms have made valuable discoveries in nutrigenomics. However, unlike yeast and C. elegans, Drosophila has adipose-like tissues and a lipid transport system, making it a closer model to humans. This review summarizes what has already been learned in Drosophila nutrigenomics (with an emphasis on lipids and sterols), critically evaluates the data, and discusses fruitful areas for future research.

TI	Deletion polymorphism of the angiotensin converting enzyme gene predicts persistent proteinuria in Henoch-Schonlein purpura nephritis.
PG	394-9
AB	OBJECTIVE: To study the influence of deletion/insertion polymorphism in the 16th intron of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene on clinical manifestations of Henoch-Schonlein purpura nephritis. STUDY DESIGN: Cross sectional study. ACE gene polymorphism was determined in patients (4-15 years old at onset) with Henoch-Schonlein purpura nephritis (n = 40) and compared with that in patients with IgA nephropathy (n = 79). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ACE genotypes, systemic blood pressures, urine protein excretion rate, haematuria, creatinine clearance, serum ACE activities. RESULTS: The initial clinical manifestations of both Henoch-Schonlein purpura nephritis and IgA nephropathy were no different among homozygotes for insertion (II) and deletion (DD), and heterozygotes (ID) for the ACE gene. In patients with Henoch-Schonlein purpura nephritis, the incidence of moderate to heavy proteinuria at four and eight years after onset was more than five times higher in the DD genotype than in the II or ID genotypes. No such trend was seen in patients with IgA nephropathy. The number of patients with Henoch-Schonlein purpura nephritis in whom proteinuria resolved at four and eight years after onset was significantly lower in the DD genotype compared with the II genotype, whereas no differences were detected among the three different genotypes in patients with IgA nephropathy. Plasma ACE activities in patients with the DD genotype were significantly higher than in those with non-DD genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: The ACE DD genotype predicts persistent proteinuria in Henoch-Schonlein purpura nephritis. The proteinuria might be related to a defective angiotensin system which is genetically determined by the D/I polymorphism.

TI	Aetiopathology and genetic basis of neonatal diabetes.
PG	F39-42
AB	A British Paediatric Association Surveillance Unit* study of neonatal diabetes determined a national incidence of 1 in 400,000 live births. Additional cases of transient neonatal diabetes were collected retrospectively. Most cases were of low birthweight at term: none had evidence of an autoimmune aetiopathogenesis. The median requirement for exogenous insulin treatment was three months. A significant number of cases developed type 2 diabetes in later life. Three of the 11 cases were found to have paternal uniparental isodisomy of chromosome 6. A further patient carried an unbalanced duplication of 6q 22-23, inherited from the father, which localised a potentially imprinted gene for diabetes to this region. The fact that low birthweight predisposes to type 2 diabetes in later life is well established, but a genetic defect that may relate both to intrauterine growth failure and the development of type 2 diabetes in later life has now been identified.

TI	Influence of CRP, IL6, and TNFA gene polymorphisms on circulating levels of C-reactive protein in Mexican adolescents.
PG	472-7
AB	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Obesity correlates with a chronic and low-grade inflammation status. C-reactive protein (CRP) measurement has been used as an independent risk marker for future cardiovascular events. CRP level shows interindividual variability due to environmental and genetic factors. The aim of this study was to assess the association of functional polymorphisms on CRP, IL6, and TNFA genes with serum CRP levels in Mexican mestizo adolescents. METHODS: Body mass index (BMI), serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels, and genotypes for CRP+1444C&gt;T, IL6-174G&gt;C, and TNFA-308G&gt;A polymorphisms were obtained from 418 unrelated Mexican adolescents. Genetic association with hsCRP levels was evaluated by means of a dominant genetic model with uni	and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Genotype frequencies for all three polymorphisms were according to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). CRP+1444T, TNFA-308A, and IL6-174C allele frequencies were 37, 7, and 10%, respectively. CRP+1444T was associated with higher mean CRP levels independent of age, gender and BMI (beta = 0.21; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 0.02-0.39); p = 0.030). IL6-174C was associated with low CRP levels in the overweight group (p = 0.005). IL6-174G&gt;C and TNFA-308G&gt;A allele frequencies observed from this Mexican sample were similar to data for other Mexican populations. CONCLUSIONS: The CRP+1444C&gt;T polymorphism was associated with CRP levels in Mexican adolescents and could be used as a genetic marker for the early detection of individuals at risk for developing obesity-related conditions such as cardiovascular disease or type 2 diabetes mellitus in early adulthood.

TI	[Programming nutritional and metabolic disorders: the diabetic environment during gestation].
PG	60-70
AB	During the last years, obesity and subsequent metabolic disorders and cardiovascular diseases have tremendously increased. Recent studies have shown that risk factors of cardiovascular diseases appear as soon as in infancy. In many situations, these disorders are programmed in early life during fetal development. These observations have lead to the concept of programming. The first studies on this subject underlined the link between poor fetal growth and the risk of nutritional and metabolic disorders during adulthood. But, it is now evident that excess of fetal growth as it is observed during pregnancy with maternal diabetes leads to the same consequences. The metabolic syndrome or syndrome X is the name for a clustering of risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and type II diabetes that are of metabolic origin. This syndrome, first described in the adults, is more and more studied during childhood and adolescence. Metabolic syndrome is now described in youth, particularly in subjects with risk factors as obesity. Alterations of intra-uterine environment lead to modified early development and represent short-term adaptations transmitted from one generation to another. This intergeneration effect contributes to the burden of adult metabolic disorders and cardiovascular diseases, as seen in the last decades. There is considerable evidence for the contribution of epigenetic mechanisms for the lifelong and the intergenerational alteration of gene transcription by variation in the early life environment. One of the major challenges in the following years is to promote public health programs which are aimed at prevention of long-term consequences of fetal programming.

AB	OBJECTIVE: To report the long-term (30-month) effect of the switch from insulin to sulfonylurea in a patient carrying the p.G53D (c.158G&gt;A) mutation in KCNJ11 gene. SUBJECT AND METHOD: A 29-year-old male patient was diagnosed with diabetes in the third month of life and after identification of a heterozygous p.G53D mutation in the KCNJ11 gene, the therapy was switched from insulin to sulfonylurea. RESULTS: Long-term follow-up (30 months) showed that good metabolic control was maintained (HbA1c: 6.6%) and the glibenclamide dose could be reduced. CONCLUSION: Long-term therapy with sulfonylureas in patients with neonatal diabetes due to mutation in the KCNJ11 gene is safe and promotes sustained improvement of glycemic control.

TI	Atypical generalized lipoatrophy and severe insulin resistance due to a heterozygous LMNA p.T10I mutation.
PG	1252-6
LID	S0004-27302008000800008 [pii]
AB	Lipodystrophies are a group of heterogeneous disorders characterized by the loss of adipose tissue and metabolic complications. The main familial forms of lipodystrophy are Congenital Generalized Lipodystrophy and Familial Partial Lipodystrophy (FPLD). FPLD may result from mutations in the LMNA gene. Besides FPLD, mutations in LMNA have been shown to be responsible for other inherited diseases called laminopathies. Here we describe the case of a 15-year-old girl who was referred to our service due to diabetes mellitus and severe hypertriglyceridemia. Physical examination revealed generalized loss of subcutaneous fat, confirmed by DEXA (total body fat 8.6%). As the patient presented with pubertal-onset of generalized lipodystrophy and insulin resistance, molecular analysis of the LMNA gene was performed. We identified a heterozygous substitution in exon 1 (c.29C&gt;T) predicting a p.T10I mutation. In summary, we describe an atypical phenotype of lipodistrophy associated with a de novo appearance of the p.T10I mutation in LMNA gene.

TI	A further case of a Prader-Willi syndrome phenotype in a patient with Angelman syndrome molecular defect.
PG	1011-4
AB	Angelman syndrome (AS) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) are distinct human neurogenetic disorders; however, a clinical overlap between AS and PWS has been identified. We report on a further case of a patient showing the PWS phenotype with the AS molecular defect. Despite the PWS phenotype, the DNA methylation analysis of SNRPN revealed an AS pattern. Cytogenetic and FISH analysis showed normal chromosomes 15 and microsatellite analysis showed heterozygous loci inside and outside the 15q11-13 region. The presence of these atypical cases could be more frequent than previously expected and we reinforce that the DNA methylation analysis is important for the correct diagnosis of severe mental deficiency, congenital hypotonia and obesity.

TI	Apolipoprotein E polymorphisms affect atherosclerosis in young males. Pathobiological Determinants of Atherosclerosis in Youth (PDAY) Research Group.
PG	1237-44
AB	Investigators in eight communities collected aortas, right coronary arteries, blood and liver samples, and associated information from 720 young males, aged 15-34 years, who died of external causes. Genotypes for apolipoprotein (apo) E isoforms (E2, E3, and E4) were determined from hepatic DNA by restriction isotyping (restriction enzyme isoform genotyping) of amplified apo E sequences. Pathologists graded the arteries for atherosclerotic lesions, and a central laboratory measured lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. Allele frequencies were different between blacks and whites (p less than 0.0001). E2 and E4 frequencies were higher and E3 frequency was lower in blacks than in whites. Among the common genotypes in both whites and blacks, E2E3 heterozygotes had the lowest levels of total serum cholesterol and low density lipoproteins, E3E4 had the highest levels, and E3E3 had intermediate levels. Apo E genotypes differed in mean percent surface area involvement with lesions in the thoracic aorta and the abdominal aorta of both whites and blacks (p less than or equal to 0.0002). Among the common genotypes, E2E3 heterozygotes had the least involvement of both thoracic and abdominal aortas with lesions, E3E4 had the greatest involvement (with the exception of the thoracic aorta in whites), and E3E3 had intermediate involvement. Apo E genotype accounted for 5.7% in whites and 5.9% in blacks of the observed variation in lesions for the thoracic aorta, and for 5.9% in whites and 7.0% in blacks for the abdominal aorta. Adjusting for cholesterol levels did not change apo E genotypic effects appreciably, an observation suggesting that genotypic effects on arterial lesions may not be mediated entirely by changes in serum cholesterol concentrations.

TI	Type III dyslipoproteinemia in patients heterozygous for familial hypercholesterolemia and apolipoprotein E2. Evidence for a gene-gene interaction.
PG	1137-46
AB	In four large pedigrees with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) genetically linked to the low density lipoprotein receptor locus, we have observed a strong interaction between the presence of FH and a single apolipoprotein (apo) E2 allele, resulting in a markedly increased prevalence of type III dyslipoproteinemia (DLPIII). DLPIII was defined by chemical criteria. None of the patients with DLPIII had tuberous or palmar xanthomas characteristic of classically defined type III hyperlipoproteinemia. After exclusion of four persons with apo E 2-2 phenotype, there were 89 FH patients and 110 non-FH subjects. Definite DLPIII (defined as a very low density lipoprotein [VLDL] cholesterol to plasma triglyceride ratio greater than 0.30 with plasma triglycerides greater than or equal to 150 mg/dl) was present in 26% of 43 FH patients with a single E2 allele compared with only 3.4% of 29 non-FH subjects with an E2 allele (p = 0.003). To further characterize this interaction we performed a two-way analysis of covariance, after adjustment for age, sex, and body mass index, to test for any interaction between FH and the apo E loci. There was a statistically significant interaction between FH and the presence of a single E2 allele for the ratio of VLDL cholesterol to plasma triglycerides and for a newly derived estimate of beta-VLDL cholesterol concentration. Estimated beta-VLDL cholesterol level was strongly correlated with age in the subgroup with FH and an E2 allele but not in other subgroups. There was no difference in estimated beta-VLDL cholesterol between sexes. Correlation between estimated beta-VLDL cholesterol level and body mass index in persons older than 18 years was of only marginal significance and of similar magnitude in persons with or without an apo E2 allele. Present knowledge suggests that beta-VLDLs are highly atherogenic; if so, then a sizable subset of FH patients having at least one apo E2 allele and DLPIII may be at increased risk for premature coronary heart disease.

TI	Assessment of genetic determinants of the association of gamma' fibrinogen in relation to cardiovascular disease.
PG	2345-52
AB	OBJECTIVE: gamma' fibrinogen is a newly emerging biomarker that is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the genetic determinants of gamma' fibrinogen levels are unknown. We therefore conducted a genome-wide association study on 3042 participants from the Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort. METHODS AND RESULTS: A genome-wide association study with 2.5 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was carried out for gamma' fibrinogen levels from the cycle 7 examination. Fifty-four SNPs in or near the fibrinogen gene locus demonstrated genome-wide significance (P&lt;5.0x10(-8)) for association with gamma' fibrinogen levels. The top-signal SNP was rs7681423 (P=9.97x10(-110)) in the fibrinogen gene locus near FGG, which encodes the gamma chain. Conditional on the top SNP, the only other SNP that remained genome-wide significant was rs1049636. Associations between SNPs, gamma' fibrinogen levels, and prevalent CVD events were examined using multiple logistic regression. gamma' fibrinogen levels were associated with prevalent CVD (P=0.02), although the top 2 SNPs associated with gamma' fibrinogen levels were not associated with CVD. These findings contrast those for total fibrinogen levels, which are associated with different genetic loci, particularly FGB, which encodes the Bbeta chain. CONCLUSIONS: gamma' fibrinogen is associated with prevalent CVD and with SNPs exclusively in and near the fibrinogen gene locus.

TI	Role of heme oxygenase-1 in human endothelial cells: lesson from the promoter allelic variants.
PG	1634-41
AB	OBJECTIVE: Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is an antioxidative, antiinflammatory, and cytoprotective enzyme that is induced in response to cellular stress. The HO-1 promoter contains a (GT)n microsatellite DNA, and the number of GT repeats can influence the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases. We elucidated the effect of this polymorphism on endothelial cells isolated from newborns of different genotypes. METHODS AND RESULTS: On the basis of HO-1 expression, we classified the HO-1 promoter alleles into 3 groups: short (S) (most active, GT &lt; or = 23), medium (moderately active, GT=24 to 28), and long (least active, GT &gt; or = 29). The presence of the S allele led to higher basal HO-1 expression and stronger induction in response to cobalt protoporphyrin, prostaglandin-J(2), hydrogen peroxide, and lipopolysaccharide. Cells carrying the S allele survived better under oxidative stress, a fact associated with the lower concentration of oxidized glutathione and more favorable oxidative status, as determined by measurement of the ratio of glutathione to oxidized glutathione. Moreover, they proliferated more efficiently in response to vascular endothelial growth factor A, although the vascular endothelial growth factor-induced migration and sprouting of capillaries were not influenced. Finally, the presence of the S allele was associated with lower production of some proinflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6, and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1. CONCLUSIONS: The (GT)n promoter polymorphism significantly modulates a cytoprotective, proangiogenic, and antiinflammatory function of HO-1 in human endothelium.

TI	Intrauterine exposure to maternal atherosclerotic risk factors increases the susceptibility to atherosclerosis in adult life.
PG	2228-35
AB	OBJECTIVE: Maternal hypercholesterolemia is associated with a higher incidence and faster progression of atherosclerotic lesions in neonatal offspring. We aimed to determine whether an in utero environment exposing a fetus to maternal hypercholesterolemia and associated risk factors can prime the murine vessel wall to accelerated development of cardiovascular disease in adult life. METHODS AND RESULTS: To investigate the epigenetic effect in utero, we generated genetically identical heterozygous apolipoprotein E-deficient progeny from mothers with a wild-type or apolipoprotein E-deficient background. A significant increase in loss of endothelial cell volume was observed in the carotid arteries of fetuses of apolipoprotein E-deficient mothers, but fatty streak formation was absent. Spontaneous atherosclerosis development was absent in the aorta and carotid arteries in adult life. We unilaterally placed a constrictive collar around the carotid artery to induce lesion formation. In offspring from apolipoprotein E-deficient mothers, collar placement resulted in severe neointima formation in 9 of 10 mice analyzed compared with only minor lesion volume (2 of 10) in the progeny of wild-type mothers. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the susceptibility to neointima formation of morphologically normal adult arteries is already imprinted during prenatal development and manifests itself in the presence of additional atherogenic risk factors in adult life. Future research will concentrate on the mechanisms involved in this priming process, as well as on prevention strategies.

TI	Haplotypes of IL1B, IL1RN, IL1R1, and IL1R2 and the risk of venous thrombosis.
PG	1486-91
AB	OBJECTIVE: It has been suggested that the overall effect of the major proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) on coagulation and fibrinolysis is prothrombotic. The aim of this study was to investigate whether common variations in IL1B, IL1RN, IL1R1, and IL1R2 influence the risk of venous thrombosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a case-control study on the causes of deep venous thrombosis, the Leiden Thrombophilia Study (LETS), we genotyped 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IL1B, IL1RN, IL1R1, and IL1R2, enabling us to tag a total of 25 haplotype groups. Overall testing of the haplotype frequency distribution in patients and controls indicated that a recessive effect was present in IL1RN (P=0.031). Subsequently the risk of venous thrombosis was calculated for each haplotype of IL1RN. Increased thrombotic risk was found for homozygous carriers of haplotype 5 (H5, tagged by SNP 13888T/G, rs2232354) of IL1RN (Odds ratio=3.9; 95% confidence interval: 1.6 to 9.7; P=0.002). No risk was associated with haplotype 3 of IL1RN, which contains the frequently examined allele 2 variant of the intron 2 VNTR. CONCLUSIONS: We found that IL1RN-H5H5 carriership increases the risk of venous thrombosis.

TI	Phenotype of heterozygotes for low-density lipoprotein receptor mutations identified in different background populations.
PG	211-5
AB	BACKGROUND: The effect of mutations on phenotype is often overestimated because of ascertainment bias. We determined the effect of background population on cholesterol phenotype associated with specific mutations in the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and the relative importance of background population and type of mutation (LDL receptor [LDLR] or APOB R3500Q) for cholesterol phenotype. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 9255 individuals from the general population, 948 patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD), and 63 patients with clinical familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) for 3 common LDL receptor mutations. Average increase in cholesterol in LDL receptor heterozygotes identified in the general population or among patients with IHD or FH compared with noncarriers was 2.9 mmol/L, 4.1 mmol/L, and 4.9 mmol/L, respectively (P=0.02). Background population and type of mutation determined cholesterol phenotype; average increase in LDL cholesterol from carriers in the general population to carriers with clinical FH was 1.6 mmol/L (P=0.03). The average increase for carriers of LDLR mutations compared with carriers of APOB R3500Q was 1.2 mmol/L (P=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The phenotype associated with a given mutation should not be determined in patients, but rather in unselected individuals in the general population.

TI	Laminopathies and atherosclerosis.
PG	1591-5
AB	Laminopathies are genetic diseases that encompass a wide spectrum of phenotypes with diverse tissue pathologies and result mainly from mutations in the LMNA gene encoding nuclear lamin A/C. Some laminopathies affect the cardiovascular system, and a few (namely, Dunnigan-type familial partial lipodystrophy [FPLD2] and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome [HGPS]) feature atherosclerosis as a key component. The premature atherosclerosis of FPLD2 is probably related to characteristic proatherogenic metabolic disturbances such as dyslipidemia, hyperinsulinemia, hypertension, and diabetes. In contrast, the premature atherosclerosis of HGPS occurs with less exposure to metabolic proatherogenic traits and probably reflects the generalized process of accelerated aging in HGPS. Although some common polymorphisms of LMNA have been associated with traits related to atherosclerosis, the monogenic diseases FPLD2 and HGPS are more likely to provide clues about new pathways for the general process of atherosclerosis. Dunnigan-type familial partial lipodystrophy and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome are laminopathies caused by mutation in LMNA that feature atherosclerosis, which is related to proatherogenic metabolic disturbances and to the generalized process of accelerated aging, respectively. These monogenic diseases may provide clues about new pathways for atherogenesis.

TI	Association between the PPARA L162V polymorphism and plasma lipid levels: the Framingham Offspring Study.
PG	805-10
AB	Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) alpha is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that regulates key proteins involved in fatty acid oxidation, extracellular lipid metabolism, hemostasis, and inflammation. A L162V polymorphism at the PPARA locus has been associated with alterations in lipid and apolipoprotein concentrations. We studied the association among lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins and the presence of the L162V polymorphism in 2373 participants (1128 men and 1244 women) in the Framingham Offspring Study. The frequency of the less common allele (V162) was 0.069. The V162 allele was associated with increased serum concentrations of total and LDL cholesterol in men (P=0.0012 and P=0.0004, respectively) and apolipoprotein B in men (P=0.009) and women (P=0.03 after adjustment for age, body mass index, smoking, and use of beta-blockers, diuretics or estrogens). Apolipoprotein (apo) C-III concentrations were higher in carriers of the V162 allele. The association of the L162V polymorphism on LDL cholesterol concentration was greatest in those who also carried the E2 allele at the APOE locus and the G allele at the APOC3 3238C&gt;G polymorphism. This suggests that alterations in triglyceride-rich lipoprotein metabolism may be involved in the generation of the increase in LDL cholesterol observed with the L162V PPARA polymorphism.

TI	Association of cholesteryl ester transfer protein-TaqIB polymorphism with variations in lipoprotein subclasses and coronary heart disease risk: the Framingham study.
PG	1323-9
AB	Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) facilitates the exchange of triglycerides and cholesteryl esters between lipoprotein particles, a key step in reverse cholesterol transport in humans. Variations at the CETP locus have been shown to be determinants of the levels and activity of CETP and high density lipoprotein (HDL) plasma concentration. The associations of the common CETP polymorphism, TaqIB in intron 1, with lipoprotein levels and particle size distribution, CETP activity, and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk were examined in a population-based sample of 1411 men and 1505 women from the Framingham Offspring Study. The B2 allele frequency was 0.444 in men and 0.433 in women, and its presence was significantly (P&lt;0.05) associated with decreased CETP activity. B1B1 men had lower HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (1.07 mmol/L) compared with B1B2 (1.14 mmol/L) and B2B2 (1.18 mmol/L) men (P&lt;0.001). Likewise, B1B1 women had lower HDL-C levels (1.40 mmol/L) compared with B1B2 (1.46 mmol/L) and B2B2 (1.53 mmol/L) women (P&lt;0.001). In men, the B2 allele was associated with increased particle size for HDL and low density lipoprotein. In women, a similar effect was demonstrated only for HDL particle size. The odds ratio for prevalent CHD associated with the B2 allele was 0.696 (P=0.035) in men. After adjusting for age, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, alcohol consumption, beta-blocker use, total cholesterol, and HDL-C, this odds ratio was 0.735 (P=0.187), suggesting that the protective effect of the B2 allele was due in part to its association with HDL-C levels. No significant protective effects were observed in women. These data demonstrate that variation at the CETP gene locus is a significant determinant of HDL-C levels, CETP activity, and lipoprotein size in this population. Moreover, these effects appear to translate into a lower CHD risk among those men with the B2 allele.

TI	Common polymorphism in promoter of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein gene influences cholesterol, ApoB, and triglyceride levels in young african american men: results from the coronary artery risk development in young adults (CARDIA) study.
PG	1316-22
AB	The microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) plays a key role in the assembly of apolipoprotein B (apoB)-containing lipoproteins. We investigated the relation between lipid profiles and a common functional polymorphism (-493G/T) of the MTP gene in a large sample of young black men in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study. We performed serial cross-sectional analyses on lipids of 586 black men in 5 exams over 10 years of follow-up. Total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and apoB levels were very similar between the GT and GG genotypes; therefore, the GT and GG genotypes were combined as 1 group when the 3 phenotypes were analyzed. The results from ANCOVA showed that the TT group (prevalence 7%) had higher levels of apoB-related lipids than did the GT+GG group: the difference in total cholesterol ranged from 2 (P=0.79) to 19 (P=0.002) mg/dL in exams 1 to 5; the difference in LDL cholesterol ranged from 10 (P=0.14) to 17 (P=0.003) mg/dL in exams 1 to 4, but in examination 5, the difference became negligible. The TT group had higher levels of apoB, measured in only 2 exams, by 6 (P=0.12) and 9 (P=0.03) mg/dL. The TT group had higher levels of triglycerides than did the TG or GG group by 3 to 34 (P=0.02 to approximately 0.003) mg/dL in all 5 exams. HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I levels were similar among the 3 genotypes. Our serial cross-sectional analyses indicated that the TT genotype was associated with higher levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and apoB in young black men. The broad effect of this polymorphism on several atherogenic traits suggests that the MTP gene could be influential in atherosclerosis.

TI	Association of the C-514T polymorphism in the hepatic lipase gene with variations in lipoprotein subclass profiles: The Framingham Offspring Study.
PG	815-22
AB	Hepatic lipase is involved in the metabolism of several lipoproteins and has a key role in reverse cholesterol transport. A common C-to-T substitution at position -514 of the hepatic lipase promoter has been associated with variations in plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and hepatic lipase activity. The aim of the current study was to investigate the association of this polymorphism to lipoprotein levels in a population-based sample of 1314 male and 1353 female Framingham Offspring Study participants. In men and women, carriers of the -514T allele had higher HDL-C and apolipoprotein A-I (apoAI) concentrations compared with noncarriers. The higher HDL-C levels associated with the -514T allele was due to an increase in the HDL(2)-C subfraction, and this association was stronger in women compared with men (P=0.0043 versus 0.0517). To gain further understanding about the metabolic basis of these effects, HDL and low density lipoprotein (LDL) subclass profiles were measured by using automated nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and gradient gel electrophoresis, respectively. The association of the -514T allele with higher HDL-C levels seen in men and women was primarily due to significant increases in the large HDL subfractions (size range 8.8 to 13.0 nm). In contrast, there was no relationship between the hepatic lipase polymorphism at position -514 and the LDL particle size distribution after adjustment for familial relationships, age, body mass index, smoking, alcohol intake, use of beta-blockers, apoE genotype, and menopausal status and estrogen therapy in women. Moreover, multiple regression analyses suggested that the C-514T polymorphism contributed significantly to the variability of HDL particle size in men and women (P&lt;0.04). Thus, our results show that the C-514T polymorphism in the hepatic lipase gene is associated with significant variations in the lipoprotein profile in men and women.

TI	A frequent mutation in the lipoprotein lipase gene (D9N) deteriorates the biochemical and clinical phenotype of familial hypercholesterolemia.
PG	2708-13
AB	The D9N substitution is a common mutation in the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene. This mutation has been associated with reduced levels of HDL cholesterol and elevated triglycerides (TG) in a wide variety of patients. We investigated the influence of this D9N mutation on lipid and lipoprotein levels and risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). A total of 2091 FH heterozygotes, all of Dutch extraction, were screened for the D9N mutation using standard polymerase chain reaction techniques, followed by specific enzyme digestion. A total of 94 FH subjects carried the D9N mutation at a carrier frequency of 4.5%. Carriers of other common LPL mutations, such as the N291S and the S447X were excluded. Clinical data on 80 FH individuals carrying the D9N were available and were compared with a FH control group matched for age, sex, and body mass index (n=203). Analysis revealed significantly higher TG (P=0.01) and lower HDL-cholesterol levels (P=0.002). Dyslipidemia was more pronounced in D9N carriers with higher body mass index. Moreover, FH patients carrying this common LPL mutation were at higher risk for CVD, (odds ratio=2.8; 95% CI, 1.43 to 5.32; P=0.002). The common D9N LPL mutation leads to increased TG and decreased HDL plasma levels in patients with FH. These effects are most apparent in those FH heterozygotes with an increased body mass index. Furthermore, this mutation, present in 4.5% of Dutch FH heterozygotes, leads to increased risk for CVD.

TI	Metabolic determinants are much more important than genetic polymorphisms in determining the PAI-1 activity and antigen plasma concentrations: a family study with part of the Stanislas Cohort.
PG	84-91
AB	Increased plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) concentration has been identified as a risk factor for coronary heart disease. We investigated the relative contribution of both metabolic factors involved in the insulin resistance (IR) syndrome and polymorphisms of the PAI-1 gene to plasma levels of PAI-1 in 228 healthy nuclear white families from the Stanislas Cohort. Variables related to IR included body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, fasting insulin, triglyceride, and HDL cholesterol. Five PAI-1 gene polymorphisms were studied, including a newly described G+12078A substitution in the 3' region. A sex difference was observed, with fathers exhibiting higher IR state and PAI-1 levels and stronger correlations between PAI-1 and IR variables than mothers. Such a difference was not observed in offspring. Family correlations were of similar magnitude for fibrinolytic parameters and IR variables. The PAI-1 genotypes A-844G, -675 4G/5G, and G+12078A polymorphisms, which were in strong linkage disequilibrium, were associated with plasma PAI-1 levels. In multivariate analysis, IR explained a major part of PAI-1 variability (49% in fathers, 29% in mothers), whereas polymorphisms had only a minor contribution, explaining 3% of variability in women and having no significant effect in men. We conclude that plasma levels of PAI-1 are, in a healthy population, primarily determined by the IR syndrome, this relationship being stronger in males. The contribution of the PAI-1 gene seems larger in females. These results deserve special attention for understanding the relationships observed between fibrinolytic parameters and the risk of developing a cardiovascular ischemic event.

TI	Lipoprotein lipase gene variation is associated with a paternal history of premature coronary artery disease and fasting and postprandial plasma triglycerides: the European Atherosclerosis Research Study (EARS).
PG	526-34
AB	The H-allele of the intron 8 HindIII polymorphism in the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene has been associated with a lower risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and plasma levels of triglycerides (TG). To test whether the HindIII site was in linkage disequilibrium with the functional variant LPL Serine447Stop (S447X), subjects from the European Atherosclerosis Research Study (EARS I) were genotyped for both polymorphic sites. This study included 515 offspring of fathers with a premature (&lt;55 years old) MI, who were designated cases, and 930 age	and sex-matched control subjects from five different regions of Europe. Linkage disequilibrium between the two sites was very strong (&gt;.99), with only three of the four possible haplotypes identified: H+S447, H-S447, and H-X447. The frequency of the H-X447 but not of the H-S447 haplotype was significantly lower in cases than in control subjects (.090 versus .117, P&lt;.01) suggesting a protective effect for MI, with this difference being consistent in all five regions of Europe. Compared with individuals homozygous for the H+S447 haplotype, the odds ratio of having a paternal history of premature MI for H-X447 heterozygotes (approximately 20% of the population) was 0.71 (95% confidence interval, 0.55 to 0.92). In addition, there was an increase of the H-X447 haplotype frequency from north to south in control subjects (0.119 in Finland to 0.143 in the Mediterranean region, P&lt;.01). Compared with the H+S447 haplotype, the H-X447 haplotype was associated with significantly lower concentrations of plasma TGs (5.4% lower, P=.01), with this effect being consistent over the regions of Europe. There was no significant evidence for a heterogeneity of effect between males and females or between cases and control subjects, although the effect on TG levels appeared to be the greatest in male cases (11% lower, P=.05). In a second study (EARS II), of 332 cases and 342 control subjects, postprandial clearance of TGs after a standard fat meal was examined. The H-X447 haplotype was associated with significantly lower postprandial triglyceride levels than was the H+S447 haplotype (9.4% smaller area under the curve, P&lt;.05). Thus, the effects on MI risk and plasma lipids associated with the H allele appeared to be mainly mediated by the X447 mutation, and although the lowering effects associated with the H-X447 haplotype on fasting and postprandial TGs are not large, they are consistent with the lowering effect observed on MI risk throughout Europe.

TI	Familial hypercholesterolemia in the Finnish north Karelia. A molecular, clinical, and genealogical study.
PG	3127-38
AB	A specific mutation termed FH-North Karelia [FH-NK] accounts for almost 90% of familial hypercholesterolemia [FH] cases in the Finnish North Karelia, with a population of about 180,000. Extensive search for its presence in the entire North Karelia province revealed 340 carriers of this mutation. Other mutations of the LDL receptor [LDLR] gene accounted for 67 cases of heterozygous FH. This gives a minimum FH prevalence of 1 in 441 inhabitants in North Karelia, with the highest density of patients in the Polvijarvi commune (1 in 143 inhabitants). Old parish records, confirmation records, and tax records were used to track a common ancestor for most of the present-day North Karelian FH-NK patients in the village of Puso, located within an area where the FH prevalence today is the highest. DNA analysis indicated that 2% of the subjects aged 1 to 25 years would have been diagnosed as false-negative and 7% as false-positive FH patients on the basis of LDL cholesterol [LDL-C] determinations alone. Common genetic variations of apolipoprotein E [apoE], XbaI, polymorphism of apolipoprotein B [apoB], and PvuII polymorphism of the intact LDLR allele contributed little to serum lipid variation in established carriers of the FH-NK allele, although apoE2/4 genotype and the presence of the PvuII restriction site tended to be associated with relatively low LDL-C levels. Coronary heart disease (CHD) was present in 65 (30%) out of the 179 FH gene carriers aged &gt; or = 25 years, and 19 individuals had a previous history of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The average age (mean +/	SD) at onset of CHD was 42 +/	7 years for males and 48 +/	11 years for females (P &lt; .05). In stepwise logistic regression analysis carried out in carriers of the FH-NK allele, age, gender, smoking, and apoE allele E2 all emerged as independent determinants of risk of CHD or AMI. It may be concluded that the relatively high prevalence of FH patients in North Karelia province provides a unique founder population in which genetic and nongenetic factors modifying the course of FH can be effectively investigated.

TI	Distribution in healthy and coronary populations of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T mutation.
PG	878-82
AB	Modest elevations of circulating homocyst(e)ine are common in patients with vascular disease. We explored in normal and coronary artery disease (CAD) populations the distribution of a mutation in the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene that results in enzyme thermolability and reduced activity and in homocyst(e)ine elevation to assess its relevance to risk. We identified the C to T substitution at the MTHFR locus and compared the distributions of genotypes in 565 patients aged &lt; or = 65 years without and with angiographically documented CAD and in 225 healthy subjects. In the patients, we also assessed interrelations between genotypes and CAD occurrence and severity, as well as standard risk factors. The frequency of homozygotes for the mutation was the same in patients with and without CAD and in healthy subjects (11.6%, 11.0%, and 10.7%, respectively: P &gt; .5 for each). There was also no excess among the 419 patients with severe disease (ie, one or more vessels with &gt; 50% luminal obstruction) compared with those with no or mild CAD (odds ratio: 1.004; 95% confidence interval: 0.59 to 1.70). Homozygosity for the mutation was also not associated with a history of myocardial infarction or the presence or severity of angina. However, body mass index increased linearly with the presence of the mutant allele (P = .005), and the mutation and hypertension were weakly associated (P = .036). We conclude that the MTHFR genotype is not a risk factor for coronary disease in this Australian population but that the strong association found with body mass index should be explored further.

TI	Lp(a) levels and atherosclerotic vascular disease in a sample of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia sharing the same gene defect.
PG	129-36
AB	There is considerable variation in the severity of cardiovascular disease among patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Some reports have suggested that plasma lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels may explain such variation and that FH subjects deficient in LDL receptors, especially those with coronary heart disease, tend to have elevated Lp(a) levels. We have investigated the possible role of the LDL receptor in determining plasma Lp(a) levels in genetically homogeneous FH population and the contribution of Lp(a) to cardiovascular risk. A total of 98 FH subjects and 66 healthy first	and second-degree relatives from 30 families with FH due to the French-Canadian &gt; 10-kilobase deletion of the LDL receptor gene were studied. A reference group of 392 normolipidemic French-Canadian participants in a Heart Health Survey was used for comparison. FH subjects were subdivided into subsets of 63 individuals free from atherosclerotic vascular disease (AVD) and 35 individuals with AVD. A complete cardiovascular evaluation was performed, and plasma lipid, lipoprotein, and Lp(a) levels were measured in all subjects in the absence of medication. Apolipoprotein (a) [apo(a)] phenotype was determined in 112 of FH and non-FH subjects. The log-transformed values for plasma Lp(a) were not significantly different among the three groups: 0.98 +/	0.54 (mean +/	SD) in FH subjects with AVD, 0.89 +/	0.51 in FH subjects without AVD, and 0.82 +/	0.64 in their relatives. The distribution of the apo(a) phenotypes did not differ between the FH and non-FH groups. Comparison of two age	and sex-matched subgroups of FH subjects, with and without AVD, failed to show any differences in Lp(a) level. However, mean Lp(a) log values in the reference group (n = 392) were significantly lower than values obtained for the total FH group (0.79 +/	0.57 versus 0.92 +/	0.52, respectively; P &lt; .05) but were not different from those of the unaffected family members. Thus, in our sample, the LDL receptor appears not to influence plasma Lp(a) levels; rather, these levels reflect shared apo(a) genes. The cardiovascular risk in this group of subjects with FH was related to age, male sex, total and LDL cholesterol, and higher apoB but not Lp(a) levels.

TI	Pediatric implications of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Screening and dietary treatment.
PG	I111-20
AB	Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is completely expressed at birth and in childhood by significant elevations of plasma total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. High density lipoprotein cholesterol levels can be low in FH. Screening of children for FH using a LDL cholesterol level is efficient in families with known FH, while for general population screening, the LDL cholesterol level is too nonspecific. Newer cellular and molecular biologic approaches of screening for FH promise to be more specific. A diet low in cholesterol (less than 200 mg/day), total fat (30% of calories), and saturated fat (less than 10% of calories) but moderately enriched in polyunsaturated fat (up to 10% of calories) will lower the total and LDL cholesterol levels about 10% to 15% in most heterozygous FH children. Many children will eventually require the addition of a drug to achieve satisfactory lowering of the LDL cholesterol level. The early detection and treatment of FH offers the optimal approach to the prevention of premature coronary artery disease.

TI	LIPC variants in the promoter and intron 1 modify HDL-C levels in a sex-specific fashion.
PG	171-7
AB	We previously reported linkage for plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) on 15q21 in Caucasian families from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Family Heart Study (NHLBI FHS). Hepatic lipase gene (LIPC), which has a major role in lipoprotein metabolism, resides within the linkage region and constitutes an obvious candidate gene. While hepatic lipase is a known player in HDL metabolism, the relationship between common LIPC variants and HDL-C levels remains unclear. In the current study, we employed population-based and family-based tests of association with both quantitative HDL-C levels and a dichotomous dyslipidemia trait (affected men: HDL&lt;40 mg/dL and women: HDL&lt;50 mg/dL, denoted as low HDL). We genotyped 19 tag-SNPs spanning 139.9 kb around the LIPC in the 591 families (2238 subjects). Strong association in a proxy-promoter 5' SNP (rs261342) and HDL-C levels was detected in women, but not in men. The less common allele was associated with an increase of approximately 14% in HDL-C levels, and a decrease of approximately 30% in risk of low HDL. In addition, strong association in women of an intron 1 SNP (rs12593008) and low HDL and moderate association in men (rs8028759) with both HDL-C levels and low HDL phenotype were found and may represent either functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), or more likely, SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with functional variants. Because of the association of lipid abnormalities with diabetes, and other lifestyle parameters, we also performed association analyses using different covariate adjustments as well as strategically selected sub-samples. The sex-specific association of rs261342, rs12593008 or rs8028759 remained substantially the same through these analyses. Finally, we found that a common haplotype was overtransmitted to offspring with low HDL-C. The sex-specific associations found in our study could be due to the interactions with the endogenous hormonal environment, lifestyle and/or genetic factors, although the underlying physiologic mechanisms are not understood.

TI	IL1B genetic variation and plasma C-reactive protein level among young adults: the CARDIA study.
PG	513-20
AB	OBJECTIVE: Interleukin-1B (IL1B) modulates C-reactive protein (CRP) expression. However, whether IL1B genetic variation is associated with CRP level is unknown. Further, obesity, a state of low-grade inflammation that influences cellular IL-1 functions may modify this association. METHODS AND RESULTS: Study participants (N=3289), 48% blacks and 52% whites, had CRP level measurements at year 7 and year 15 examinations as part of the CARDIA study. Ten tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that characterize common IL1B gene variation were genotyped. In SNP analysis, no significant associations with either level or change in time CRP were observed after multiple testing adjustments. However, global ILIB gene variation was associated with year 7 to year 15 change in CRP (global nominal p=0.004, multiple testing corrected p=0.048) among obese blacks. Compared to the commonest haplotype, a common haplotype that includes the SNP rs1143642 was associated with greater increases in CRP from year 7 to year 15 among obese blacks and whites while another common haplotype that includes the SNP rs3917356 was associated with decreased change in CRP from year 7 to year 15 among obese blacks. The rare alleles of ILIB SNPs, SNP 7114 (rs1143642) and SNP 3298 (rs3917356), were associated with greater increases and decreases in CRP from year 7 to year 15 among blacks, respectively, compared to their common variants. CONCLUSION: IL1B genetic variation may have a role in CRP level regulation and this association may be modified by obesity.

TI	Familial hypercholesterolaemia in Portugal.
PG	633-42
AB	Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is characterised clinically by an increased level of circulating LDL cholesterol that leads to lipid accumulation in tendons and arteries, premature atherosclerosis and increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Although Portugal should have about 20,000 cases, this disease is severely under-diagnosed in our country, this being the first presentation of Portuguese data on FH. A total of 602 blood samples were collected from 184 index patients and 418 relatives from several centres throughout Portugal. Fifty-three different mutations were found in 83 index patients, 79 heterozygous and 4 with two defective LDLR alleles. Additionally, 4 putative alterations were found in 8 patients but were not considered mutations causing disease, mainly because they did not co-segregate with hypercholesterolaemia in the families. Three unrelated patients were found to be heterozygous for the APOB(3500) mutation and two unrelated patients were found to be heterozygous for a novel mutation in PCSK9, predicted to cause a single amino acid substitution, D374H. Cascade screening increased the number of FH patients identified genetically to 204. The newly identified FH patients are now receiving counselling and treatment based on the genetic diagnosis. The early identification of FH patients can increase their life expectancy and quality of life by preventing the development of premature CHD if patients receive appropriate pharmacological treatment.

TI	A single nucleotide polymorphism of the apolipoprotein A-V gene -1131T&gt;C modulates postprandial lipoprotein metabolism.
PG	163-8
AB	The Apolipoprotein A-V (apoA-V) gene promoter polymorphism -1131T&gt;C modulates triacylglycerol (TG) concentrations. We evaluate whether this polymorphism could be involved in the interindividual variability observed during postprandial lipemia. Fifty-one healthy apo E3E3 male volunteers [12 with -1131CC/CT genotype, and 39 with -1131TT genotype] underwent a Vitamin A fat-load test consisting of 1g of fat/kg body weight and 60,000IU of Vitamin A. Blood samples were taken at time 0 and every hour until the 6th and every 2h and 30 min until the 11th. Cholesterol (Chol) and TG were determined in plasma and Chol, TG, ApoB-100, ApoB-48, and retinyl palmitate (RP) were determined in lipoprotein fractions. Data of postprandial lipemia revealed that subjects with the -1131CT/CC genotype had a higher postprandial response of total plasma TG (p=0.043), large triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins-TG (TRL-TG) (p=0.002), large TRL-Chol (p=0.004), small TRL-Chol (p=0.004) and small TRL-RP (p=0.001) than subjects with the -1131TT genotype. The modifications observed in postprandial lipoprotein metabolism in subjects with the apoA-V -1131T&gt;C polymorphism could be involved in the increased fasting plasma TG concentrations previously described in carriers of the C allele.

TI	Association of endothelial lipase gene (LIPG) haplotypes with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol subfractions and apolipoprotein AI plasma levels in Japanese Americans.
PG	78-86
AB	The LIPG gene on chromosome 18 encodes for endothelial lipase, a member of the triglyceride lipase family. Mouse models suggest that variation in LIPG influences high-density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism, but only limited data are available in humans. This study examined associations of LIPG haplotypes, comprising a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter region (-384A&gt;C), and a nonsynonymous SNP in exon 3 (Thr111Ile or 584C&gt;T), with lipoprotein risk factors in 541 adult Japanese Americans. A marginal association was found between LIPG diplotypes and HDL cholesterol (p=0.045). Stronger associations were seen for HDL3 cholesterol (p=0.005) and Apolipoprotein AI plasma levels (p=0.002). After adjustment for age, gender, smoking and medications, individuals homozygous for the minor allele at both SNPs (*4 haplotype) had a more favorable risk factor profile, compared to other haplotype combinations. No relationship was seen for plasma triglyceride levels or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) size, but the homozygous *4 diplotype was also associated with lower Apolipoprotein B and LDL cholesterol levels (p=0.001 and 0.015, respectively). In conclusion, this community-based family study of Japanese Americans demonstrates that LIPG variants are associated with HDL related risk factors, and may play a role in susceptibility to cardiovascular disease in this population.

TI	Combined monogenic hypercholesterolemia and hypoalphalipoproteinemia caused by mutations in LDL-R and LCAT genes.
PG	153-9
AB	We studied a three generation family with co-dominant monogenic hypercholesterolemia and hypoalphalipoproteinemia. The proband, a 48 year-old male, was found to be heterozygous for a previously reported mutation in LDL receptor (LDL-R) gene (IVS15-3 c&gt;a) and a novel mutation in exon 6 of lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) gene (c.803 G&gt;A) causing a non-synonymous amino acid substitution (p.R244H). These mutations segregated independently in the family. The LDL-R mutation was associated with high levels of LDL-C (6.20-9.85 mmol/L) and apo B (170-255 mg/dL), comparable to those previously reported in carriers of the same mutation. The LCAT mutation was associated with low levels of HDL-C (0.67-0.80 mmol/L) and apo A-I (96-110 mg/dL). The proband had reduced LCAT function, as measured by cholesterol esterification rate (29 nmol/(mL/h) versus 30-60 nmol/(mL/h)), LCAT activity (10 nmol/(mL/h) versus 20-55 nmol/(mL/h)) and LCAT mass (2.87 microg/mL versus 3.1-6.7 microg/mL). Carriers of LCAT mutation had lower LCAT activity and a tendency to reduced cholesterol esterification rate (CER) and LCAT mass as compared to non-carrier family members. The LCAT mutation was not found in 80 control subjects and 60 patients with primary hypoalphalipoproteinemia. Despite the unfavourable lipoprotein profile, the proband had only mild clinical signs of atherosclerosis. This unexpected finding is probably due to the intensive lipid lowering treatment the patient has been on over the last decade.

TI	Familial HDL deficiency due to ABCA1 gene mutations with or without other genetic lipoprotein disorders.
PG	309-20
AB	Mutations in ABCA1 have been shown to be the cause of Tangier disease (TD) and some forms of familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia (HA), two genetic disorders characterized by low plasma HDL levels. Here we report six subjects with low HDL, carrying seven ABCA1 mutations, six of which are previously unreported. Two mutations (R557X and H160FsX173) were predicted to generate short truncated proteins; two mutations (E284K and Y482C) were located in the first extracellular loop and two (R1901S and Q2196H) in the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of ABCA1. Two subjects found to be compound heterozygotes for ABCA1 mutations did not have overt clinical manifestations of TD. Three subjects, all with premature coronary artery disease (pCAD), had a combination of genetic defects. Besides being heterozygotes for ABCA1 mutations, two of them were also carriers of the R3500Q substitution in apolipoprotein B and the third was a carrier of N291S substitution in lipoprotein lipase. By extending family studies we identified 17 heterozygotes for ABCA1 mutations. Plasma HDL-C and Apo A-I values in these subjects were 38.3 and 36.9% lower than in unaffected family members and similar to the values found in heterozygotes for Apo A-I gene mutations which prevent Apo A-I synthesis. This survey underlines the allelic heterogeneity of ABCA1 mutations and suggests that: (i) TD subjects, if asymptomatic, may be overlooked and (ii) there may be a selection bias in genotyping towards carriers of ABCA1 mutations who have pCAD possibly related to a combination of genetic and environmental cardiovascular risk factors.

TI	DNA polymorphisms of the apoprotein B gene are associated with altered plasma lipoprotein concentrations but not with perceived risk of cardiovascular disease: European Atherosclerosis Research Study.
PG	221-34
AB	Three polymorphisms of the apoprotein B gene (XbaI, signal peptide insertion/deletion and the 3'-variable number of tandem repeats) selected on the basis of previously published reports as likely to be the most informative, were investigated in a cross-cultural study in Europe. Students from 14 universities, grouped for analyses into five regions, were recruited as cases (n = 682) if they had a paternal history of premature myocardial infarction. For comparison, twice the number of age	and sex-matched controls (n = 1312) were recruited from the same student populations. There were significant regional differences in allele frequencies of the XbaI and VNTR polymorphisms but not of the signal peptide. There were no significant differences in allele frequencies between cases and controls. Adjusted for age, gender and region, the lipoprotein concentrations differed significantly with genotype. The XbaI polymorphism was associated with differences in plasma cholesterol (P = 0.007), triglyceride (P = 0.050), apo B (P = 0.001) and LDL cholesterol (P = 0.01). An interaction between XbaI genotype and body mass index was observed on plasma triglyceride (P = 0.015) and apo B (P = 0.005) concentrations. The signal peptide deletion allele was associated with increased plasma cholesterol (P = 0.03), apo B (P = 0.04) and LDL cholesterol (P = 0.02). The VNTR was not significantly associated with any of these variables although there was a significant genotype/status interaction in relation to HDL cholesterol (P = 0.001) and apo AI (P = 0.001) concentrations. We conclude that, although they are associated with significant differences in lipoprotein concentrations within	and between-populations, the apo B DNA polymorphisms studied are of less value as indicators of cardiovascular risk-factor status in the offspring of individuals affected by the disease.

TI	The role of XbaI polymorphism of the apolipoprotein B gene in determining levels and covariability of lipid and lipoprotein variables in a sample of Israeli offspring with family history of myocardial infarction.
PG	165-77
AB	We have determined the frequency of DNA polymorphism of the gene for human apolipoprotein B detected with XbaI in 525 Israeli offspring whose parents experienced a myocardial infarction. The relative frequencies of the X1 (8.6 kb) and X2 (5.0 kb) alleles were 0.67 and 0.33, respectively, with no significant differences between males and females and across the different origin groups. Significant variation in sex, age and body mass adjusted plasma levels of cholesterol (P = 0.02), LDL-C (P = 0.02) and apo B (P = 0.03) were associated with the XbaI polymorphism. An interaction with age was demonstrated. For young individuals a simple codominant association of the XbaI site with cholesterol and LDL-C was evident and the differences between the two homozygote groups ranged between 22 and 25 mg/dl. For individuals above age 25 these differences were about 12 mg/dl with no significant difference between the X1X2 and the X2X2 genotype groups. In our study sample the apo B XbaI polymorphism accounted for 1% of the variability of plasma cholesterol, LDL-C and apo B levels. The XbaI polymorphism also had an effect on the associations among lipid and lipoprotein variables. In conclusion, we have demonstrated an association of the apo B XbaI polymorphism with the metabolism of the apo B-containing lipoprotein particles in a sample of Israeli offspring with a family history of myocardial infarction.

TI	New insights into the genetic basis of intellectual disabilities.
PG	41-5
AB	BACKGROUND: Within general practice patients with intellectual disabilities are common. OBJECTIVE: This article sheds some new light on the underlying genetic mechanisms of intellectual disabilities. It outlines the genetic basis of known inherited and sporadic causes that have recently been understood through new molecular advances. DISCUSSION: General practice has an important role to play in pursuing a precise biomedical diagnosis by improving information provided to the patient and family regarding recurrence risks and prognoses as well as management issues specific to the underlying condition. New molecular techniques are providing us with specific diagnostic tools as well as improving our understanding of the complex mechanisms that contribute to what is known as human intelligence.

TI	Neonatal hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia and monogenic diabetes due to a heterozygous mutation of the HNF4A gene.
PG	328-30
AB	Recent research has demonstrated that mutations of the hepatocyte nuclear factor 4-alpha (HNF4A) gene are associated with neonatal hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia. Mutations of this gene also cause one of the subtypes of monogenic diabetes, a form of diabetes formerly known as maturity-onset diabetes of the young. This article describes a family discovered to have a novel frame-shift mutation of the HNF4A gene in the setting of early-onset maternal diabetes and severe neonatal hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia. The implications of a diagnosis of HNF4A gene mutation for obstetric and paediatric practice are discussed.

TI	The developmental origins of adult disease (Barker) hypothesis.
PG	4-14
AB	Many studies have provided evidence for the hypothesis that size at birth is related to the risk of developing disease in later life. In particular, links are well established between reduced birthweight and increased risk of coronary heart disease, diabetes, hypertension and stroke in adulthood. These relationships are modified by patterns of postnatal growth. The most widely accepted mechanisms thought to underlie these relationships are those of fetal programming by nutritional stimuli or excess fetal glucocorticoid exposure. It is suggested that the fetus makes physiological adaptations in response to changes in its environment to prepare itself for postnatal life. These changes may include epigenetic modification of gene expression. Less clear at this time are the relevance of fetal programming phenomena to twins and preterm babies, and whether any of these effects can be reversed after birth. Much current active research in this field will be of direct relevance to future obstetric practice.

TI	Genetic susceptibility markers in Danish patients with type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes--evidence for polygenicity in man. Danish Study Group of Diabetes in Childhood.
PG	169-78
AB	Fifty-five Danish families with two offspring concordant for type 1 diabetes--identified through a nationwide population-based survey, and 57 &quot;true sporadic&quot; cases--matched with familial cases for age at onset, but with no IDDM-affected first-degree relatives and long disease duration, and 110 control subjects were typed for putative genetic susceptibility markers for type 1 diabetes identified from a pathogenetic model. The markers included MHC class I, II and III loci, the manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) locus (chr. 6q), interleukin-1 beta (IL1B), the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL1RN), and the IL-1 type 1 receptor (IL1RI) loci (each chr. 2q). No significant differences between familial and sporadic cases were found within the MHC region (including the following loci: HLA-DQ, -DR, heat shock protein (HSP) 70, tumour necrosis factor (TNF), HLA-B and -A). In both groups of patients 11% were negative for both DQA1*0301-DQB1*0302 and DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201 genotypes, and 7% of the type 1 diabetics had genotypes unable to encode a susceptibility DQ alpha beta heterodimer. Disease association was found for the IL1RN (p = 0.04) and for the IL1RI (p = 0.03). When comparing controls and only familial cases with type 1 diabetes for the IL1RN polymorphism a difference was observed (p = 0.003). For the IL1B RFLP a trend for difference was observed between familial cases and control subjects (p = 0.046), whereas no differences between sporadic cases and control subjects could be demonstrated neither at the IL1B nor at the IL1RN loci. A difference in the MnSOD pattern was observed between sporadic cases and controls (p = 0.04).

TI	Genetic and ultrastructural studies in dilated cardiomyopathy patients: a large deletion in the lamin A/C gene is associated with cardiomyocyte nuclear envelope disruption.
PG	365-77
AB	Major nuclear envelope abnormalities, such as disruption and/or presence of intranuclear organelles, have rarely been described in cardiomyocytes from dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients. In this study, we screened a series of 25 unrelated DCM patient samples for (a) cardiomyocyte nuclear abnormalities and (b) mutations in LMNA and TMPO as they are two DCM-causing genes that encode proteins involved in maintaining nuclear envelope architecture. Among the 25 heart samples investigated, we identified major cardiomyocyte nuclear abnormalities in 8 patients. Direct sequencing allowed the detection of three heterozygous LMNA mutations (p.D192G, p.Q353K and p.R541S) in three patients. By multiplex ligation-dependant probe amplification (MLPA)/quantitative real-time PCR, we found a heterozygous deletion encompassing exons 3-12 of the LMNA gene in one patient. Immunostaining demonstrated that this deletion led to a decrease in lamin A/C expression in cardiomyocytes from this patient. This LMNA deletion as well as the p.D192G mutation was found in patients displaying major cardiomyocyte nuclear envelope abnormalities, while the p.Q353K and p.R541S mutations were found in patients without specific nuclear envelope abnormalities. None of the DCM patients included in the study carried a mutation in the TMPO gene. Taken together, we found no evidence of a genotype-phenotype relationship between the onset and the severity of DCM, the presence of nuclear abnormalities and the presence or absence of LMNA mutations. We demonstrated that a large deletion in LMNA associated with reduced levels of the protein in the nuclear envelope suggesting a haploinsufficiency mechanism can lead to cardiomyocyte nuclear envelope disruption and thus underlie the pathogenesis of DCM.

TI	Is there a role of the Thr164Ile-beta(2)-adrenoceptor polymorphism for the outcome of chronic heart failure?
PG	479-84
AB	OBJECTIVE: The Thr164Ile-beta(2)-adrenoceptor (AR) polymorphism exhibits lower affinities for catecholamines and reduced basal and agonist-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in vitro. It has been suggested that patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) due to ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy carrying the Thr164Ile-beta(2)AR polymorphism exhibit much more rapid progression to death or heart transplantation (HTX) than CHF-patients carrying the homozygous Thr164-beta(2)AR. This study aimed to further evaluate the role of the Thr164Ile-beta(2)AR in CHF. For this we hypothesized that the Thr164Ile-beta(2)AR variant should be more abundant in HTX-patients than in patients with stable CHF or healthy controls. METHODS AND RESULTS: We genotyped 309 HTX-patients, 520 stable CHF-patients and 328 healthy controls for the three beta(2)AR variants Arg16Gly, Gln27Glu and Thr164Ile. The prevalence of the Thr164Ile-beta(2)AR variant was not considerably different in HTX-patients (2.3%) from that in CHF-patients (1.9%) or healthy controls (2.1%). Similarly, the frequency of the minor Ile164-allele was f(-)=0.0106 in HTX-patients, f(-)=0.0096 in CHF-patients and f(-)=0.0113 in healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of the hypofunctional Thr164Ile-beta(2)AR variant and the frequency of the Ile164-allele were almost identical in CHF-patients, who had undergone HTX, with those in patients with stable CHF or in healthy controls. Thus, the role of the Thr164Ile-beta(2)AR in CHF remains questionable.

TI	[Study of serum Hcy and polymorphisms of Hcy metabolic enzymes in 192 families affected by congenital heart disease].
PG	75-80
AB	OBJECTIVE: To explore genotype distributions at MTHFR C677T, MS A2756G, MTHFD G1958A and CBS 844 ins68bp loci in healthy Chinese living in northern area, and to assess the association of single or combined gene mutations with folic acid, Vit.B(12), Hcy levels and CHD. METHODS: 192 patients having CHD and their biological parents in Liaoning province registered as birth defects were included in this study as case group, and 124 healthy subjects (age and gender matched) and their biological parents were simultaneously selected from the same geographic area as control. To all subjects, the gene polymorphism at MTHFR C677T, MS A2756G, MTHFD G1958A and CBS 844 ins68bp loci was examined with PCR-RFLP. The serum folic acid and homocysteine (Hcy) level were analyzed with Radioimmunoassay or fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA). RESULTS: In healthy Chinese living in northern China, the mutant allele frequencies of these four loci were MTHFR 51.18%, MS 7.58%, MTHFD 24.32%, and CBS insertion 2.36%, respectively. The heterozygosity of CBS 844 ins68bp was more prevalent in case than in control (12.57% vs 2.97% in children, 10.88% vs 3.09% in father and 11.54% vs 1.02% in mother, respectively), and yielded an odds ratio (OR) of 4.70 (95% CI 1.34-25.15) in children, 3.83 (95% CI 1.05-20.98) in fathers and 12.65 (95% CI 1.92-532.47) in mothers. There is no existed significant difference at the other three loci. The percents of mothers with MTHFR, CBS and MTHFD gene polymorphisms, of mothers with MTHFR and CBS being polymorphisms (OR=8.44, 95aCI 1.23-362.26), of mothers with MTHFD and CBS being polymorphisms in case were higher than those in control. Serum folic acid levels of mothers and fathers in case were significantly higher than those of counterparts in control. Serum Hcy level of mothers in case was higher than that of counterparts in control without significant difference. Homozygous mutation at MTHFR and MTHFD loci made serum folic acid and Vit.B(12) levels slightly decreased and serum Hcy level increased. CONCLUSION: The study showed presence of ethnic and district difference of gene polymorphisms at these four loci. 68 bp insertion at exon 8 of CBS gene base 844 could be a risk factor for CHD, and the insertion in parents (especially in mothers) could increase CHD risk in offspring.

TI	Uniparental disomies 7 and 14.
PG	77-100
AB	Normally, one inherits one chromosome of each pair from one parent and the second chromosome from the other parent. Uniparental disomy (UPD) describes the inheritance of both homologues of a chromosome pair from the same parent. The biological basis of UPD syndromes is disturbed genomic imprinting. The consequences of UPD depend on the specific chromosome/segment involved and its parental origin. Phenotypes range from unapparent to unmasking of an autosomal-recessive disease to presentation as a syndromic imprinting disorder. Whilst paternal UPD(7) is clinically unapparent, maternal UPD(7) is one of several causes of Silver-Russell syndrome. Presentation of paternal UPD(14) (&quot;Kagami syndrome&quot;) is a thoracic dysplasia syndrome with mental retardation and limited survival. Findings in maternal UPD(14) (&quot;Temple&quot;) syndrome show an age-dependent overlap with the well-known maternal UPD(15) (Prader-Willi) syndrome and are dominated by initial failure to thrive followed by obesity, learning difficulties and precocious puberty. Diagnostic strategies to tackle the genetic heterogeneity of UPD(7) and UPD(14) syndromes will be explained. Management issues in UPD(7) and UPD(14) patients will be discussed, and finally areas requiring further research will be outlined.

TI	Epigenetic regulation and fetal programming.
PG	1-16
AB	Fetal programming encompasses the role of developmental plasticity in response to environmental and nutritional signals during early life and its potential adverse consequences (risk of cardiovascular, metabolic and behavioural diseases) in later life. The first studies in this field highlighted an association between poor fetal growth and chronic adult diseases. However, environmental signals during early life may lead to adverse long-term effects independently of obvious effects on fetal growth. Adverse long-term effects reflect a mismatch between early (fetal and neonatal) environmental conditions and the conditions that the individual will confront later in life. The mechanisms underlying this risk remain unclear. However, experimental data in rodents and recent observations in humans suggest that epigenetic changes in regulatory genes and growth-related genes play a significant role in fetal programming. Improvements in our understanding of the biochemical and molecular mechanisms at play in fetal programming would make it possible to identify biomarkers for detecting infants at high risk of adult-onset diseases. Such improvements should also lead to the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies.

TI	Mutant proinsulin proteins associated with neonatal diabetes are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and not efficiently secreted.
PG	1449-54
AB	Mutations in the preproinsulin protein that affect processing of preproinsulin to proinsulin or lead to misfolding of proinsulin are associated with diabetes. We examined the subcellular localization and secretion of 13 neonatal diabetes-associated human proinsulin proteins (A24D, G32R, G32S, L35P, C43G, G47V, F48C, G84R, R89C, G90C, C96Y, S101C and Y108C) in rat INS-1 insulinoma cells. These mutant proinsulin proteins accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and are poorly secreted except for G84R and in contrast to wild-type and hyperproinsulinemia-associated mutant proteins (H34D and R89H) which were sorted to secretory granules and efficiently secreted. We also examined the effect of C96Y mutant proinsulin on the synthesis and secretion of wild-type insulin and observed a dominant-negative effect of the mutant proinsulin on the synthesis and secretion of wild-type insulin due to induction of the unfolded protein response and resulting attenuation of overall translation.

TI	Promoter polymorphisms of the pigment epithelium-derived factor gene are associated with diabetic retinopathy.
PG	421-6
AB	Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF or SERPINF1), a neuroprotective and anti-angiogenic factor, may play an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy (DR). In 416 patients with type 2 diabetes, four polymorphisms in the PEDF SNPs were identified, rs12150053 and rs12948385 in the promoter region, rs9913583 in the 5'-untranslated region, and rs1136287 (Met72Thr) in exon 3. Based on case-control studies, rs12150053 and rs12948385, but not rs9913583 and rs1136287, were significantly associated with DR. A logistic regression analysis revealed that the TC or CC genotype of rs12150053 was a significant risk factor for DR (odds ratio 2.40, p=0.0004). The GA or AA genotype of rs12948385 was also a significant risk factor for DR. In addition, a significant interaction between the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and PEDF SNPs in the susceptibility to DR was found. These results demonstrate that the PEDF gene, in cooperation with the VEGF gene, may contribute to the development of DR.

TI	Polymorphism of the angiotensin I converting enzyme gene in essential hypertensive patients.
PG	661-8
AB	Insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) gene has been associated with ischemic heart disease and hypertension. The D allele reportedly correlates with myocardial infarction and it has been suggested that it may serve as the basis of population-based risk assessment. Similarly, determining whether there is an ACE allele pattern associated with hypertension could be useful in developing screening strategies. Previous reports have not shown consistent findings in Caucasian and Japanese population groups, some having a predominance of the I allele. Although African Americans have the highest prevalence of hypertension in the world, their ACE gene polymorphism frequencies have not been clearly defined. We studied the allele and genotype frequencies in this group, consisting of 133 essential hypertensive subjects, and compared their findings with those reported from normotensive African Americans and from other racial groups. The black patients had a different allele distribution than the other populations in that the D was more common than the I allele, occurring at a rate of 59.7%. The most common genotype was DD and it was present in 42.5% of the hypertensive subjects in contrast to the ID genotype which was the most commonly reported genotype in normotensive individuals. The genotype pattern (frequencies of II, ID, DD) was significantly different (p &lt; 0.005, 2 df) from Japanese and Caucasian (Scotland and Australia) populations. There was no common allele or genotype distribution amongst these diverse hypertensive groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI	A novel germline mutation in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma gene associated with large intestine polyp formation and dyslipidemia.
PG	572-81
AB	We report a novel PPARG germline mutation in a patient affected by colorectal cancer that replaces serine 289 with cysteine in the mature protein (S289C). The mutant has impaired transactivation potential and acts as dominant negative to the wild type receptor. In addition, it no longer restrains cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, the S289C mutant poorly activates target genes and interferes with the inflammatory pathway in tumor tissues and proximal normal mucosa. Consistently, only mutation carriers exhibit colonic lesions that can evolve to dysplastic polyps. The proband presented also dyslipidemia, hypertension and overweight, not associated to type 2 diabetes; of note, family members tested positive for the mutation and display only a dyslipidemic profile at variable penetrance with other biochemical parameters in the normal range. Finally, superimposing the mutation to the crystal structure of the ligand binding domain, the new Cys289 becomes so closely positioned to Cys285 to form an S-S bridge. This would reduce the depth of the ligand binding pocket and impede agonist positioning, explaining the biological effects and subcellular distribution of the mutant protein. This is the first PPARG germline mutation associated with dyslipidemia and colonic polyp formation that can progress to full-blown adenocarcinoma.

TI	Epigenetic deregulation of imprinting in congenital diseases of aberrant growth.
PG	453-9
AB	Human chromosome 11p15 comprises two imprinted domains important in the control of fetal and postnatal growth. Novel studies establish that imprinting at one of these, the IGF2-H19 domain, is epigenetically deregulated (with loss of DNA methylation) in Silver-Russell Syndrome (SRS), a congenital disease of growth retardation and asymmetry. Previously, the exact opposite epigenetic alteration (gain of DNA methylation) had been detected at the domain's 'imprinting control region' (ICR) in patients with Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS), a complex disorder of fetal overgrowth. However, more frequently, BWS is caused by loss of DNA methylation at the ICR that regulates the second imprinted domain at 11p15. Interestingly, a similar epigenetic alteration (with loss of methylation) at a putative ICR on human chromosome 6q24, is involved in transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM), a congenital disease with intrauterine growth retardation and a transient lack of insulin. Thus, fetal and postnatal growth is epigenetically controlled by different ICRs, at 11p15 and other chromosomal regions.

TI	Early life programming and neurodevelopmental disorders.
PG	314-9
AB	For more than a century, clinical investigators have focused on early life as a source of adult psychopathology. Early theories about psychic conflict and toxic parenting have been replaced by more recent formulations of complex interactions of genes and environment. Although the hypothesized mechanisms have evolved, a central notion remains: early life is a period of unique sensitivity during which experience confers enduring effects. The mechanisms for these effects remain almost as much a mystery today as they were a century ago. Recent studies suggest that maternal diet can program offspring growth and metabolic pathways, altering lifelong susceptibility to diabetes and obesity. If maternal psychosocial experience has similar programming effects on the developing offspring, one might expect a comparable contribution to neurodevelopmental disorders, including affective disorders, schizophrenia, autism, and eating disorders. Due to their early onset, prevalence, and chronicity, some of these disorders, such as depression and schizophrenia, are among the highest causes of disability worldwide according to the World Health Organization 2002 report. Consideration of the early life programming and transcriptional regulation in adult exposures supports a critical need to understand epigenetic mechanisms as a critical determinant in disease predisposition. Incorporating the latest insight gained from clinical and epidemiological studies with potential epigenetic mechanisms from basic research, the following review summarizes findings from a workshop on Early Life Programming and Neurodevelopmental Disorders held at the University of Pennsylvania in 2009.

TI	Screening for genomic rearrangements and methylation abnormalities of the 15q11-q13 region in autism spectrum disorders.
PG	349-59
AB	BACKGROUND: Maternally derived duplications of the 15q11-q13 region are the most frequently reported chromosomal aberrations in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes, caused by 15q11-q13 deletions or abnormal methylation of imprinted genes, are also associated with ASD. However, the prevalence of these disorders in ASD is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of 15q11-q13 rearrangements in a large sample of patients ascertained for ASD. METHODS: A total of 522 patients belonging to 430 families were screened for deletions, duplications, and methylation abnormalities involving 15q11-q13 with multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). RESULTS: We identified four patients with 15q11-q13 abnormalities: a supernumerary chromosome 15, a paternal interstitial duplication, and two subjects with Angelman syndrome, one with a maternal deletion and the other with a paternal uniparental disomy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that abnormalities of the 15q11-q13 region are a significant cause of ASD, accounting for approximately 1% of cases. Maternal interstitial 15q11-q13 duplications, previously reported to be present in 1% of patients with ASD, were not detected in our sample. Although paternal duplications of chromosome 15 remain phenotypically silent in the majority of patients, they can give rise to developmental delay and ASD in some subjects, suggesting that paternally expressed genes in this region can contribute to ASD, albeit with reduced penetrance compared with maternal duplications. These findings indicate that patients with ASD should be routinely screened for 15q genomic imbalances and methylation abnormalities and that MLPA is a reliable, rapid, and cost-effective method to perform this screening.

TI	Maternal obesity, inflammation, and fetal skeletal muscle development.
PG	4-12
AB	Maternal obesity coupled with Western-style high-energy diets represents a special problem that can result in poor fetal development, leading to harmful, persistent effects on offspring, including predisposition to obesity and type 2 diabetes. Mechanisms linking maternal obesity to the increased incidence of obesity and other metabolic diseases in offspring remain poorly defined. Because skeletal muscle is the principal site for glucose and fatty acid utilization and composes 40%-50% of total body mass, changes in the properties of offspring skeletal muscle and its mass resulting from maternal obesity may be responsible for the increase in type 2 diabetes and obesity. Fetal stage is crucial for skeletal muscle development because there is no net increase in the muscle fiber number after birth. Fetal skeletal muscle development involves myogenesis, adipogenesis, and fibrogenesis, which are all derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Shifting commitment of MSCs from myogenesis to adipogenesis and fibrogenesis will result in increased intramuscular fat and connective tissue, as well as reduced numbers of muscle fiber and/or diameter, all of which have lasting negative effects on offspring muscle function and properties. Maternal obesity leads to low-grade inflammation, which changes the commitment of MSCs in fetal muscle through several possible mechanisms: 1) inflammation downregulates wingless and int (WNT) signaling, which attenuates myogenesis; 2) inflammation inhibits AMP-activated protein kinase, which promotes adipogenesis; and 3) inflammation may induce epigenetic modification through polycomb group proteins. More studies are needed to further explore the underlying mechanisms associated with maternal obesity, inflammation, and the commitment of MSCs.

TI	MTHFR C677T polymorphism, GSTM1 deletion and male infertility: a possible suggestion of a gene-gene interaction?
PG	53-60
AB	Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is a gene involved in the process of DNA synthesis and methylation. The MTHFR C677T polymorphism has been associated with male infertility. A prospective study was conducted on men seeking care at the infertility clinic in Milano to determine if the MTHFR C677T polymorphism is associated with infertility, and if such an association is modified by a common deletion of one of the glutathione transferases, GSTM1. One year after enrolment, 46 subjects reported having had a child, while 59 were still childless. Subjects carrying the MTHFR C677T homozygous variant polymorphism were at increased risk of being infertile after 1-year follow-up (OR 3.7, 95% CI?=?1.4-10.4); carriers of the homozygous variant MTHFR genotype and of a functional copy of GSTM1 appear to have a significantly higher risk of infertility (n=11; OR?=?22.0 95% CI?=?3.8-127.9) than subjects who carry the wild-type genotype for both genes. Such risk becomes non-significant when the GSTM1 deletion is also present (n=5; OR?=?1.1 95% CI?=?0.2-5.1). A possible explanation of this unexpected result could lie in the known involvement of glutathione transferases in the metabolic pathways of both methylation and transulfuration. The interaction found deserves confirmation and replication in a larger population, since it may be relevant to several chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer.

TI	Neonatal programming of body weight regulation and energetic metabolism.
PG	251-69
AB	Programming is an epigenetic phenomena by which nutritional, hormonal, physical psychological and other stressful events acting in a critical period of life, such as gestation and lactation, modifies in a prolonged way certain physiological functions. This process was preserved by natural selection as an important adaptive tool for survival of organisms living in nutritional impaired areas. So, malnutrition during gestation and lactation turns on different genes that provide the organism with a thrifty phenotype. In the case of an abundant supply of nutrients after this period, those organisms that were adapted to a low metabolic waste and higher energy utilization will be in a higher risk of developing metabolic diseases, such as obesity, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The kind of malnutrition, duration and intensity are important for the type of programming obtained. We discuss some of the hormonal and metabolic changes that occur in gestation or lactation, when malnutrition is applied to the mothers and their offspring. Some of these changes, such as an increase of maternal triiodothyronine (T(3)), leptin and glucocorticoids (GC) and decrease in prolactin are by itself potential programming factors. Most of these hormones can be transfer through the milk that has other important macronutrients composition changes in malnourished dams. We discuss the programming effects of some of these hormones upon body weight and composition, leptin, thyroid and adrenal functions, and their effects on liver, muscle and adipose tissue metabolism and the consequences on thermogenesis.

TI	Diabetic embryopathy: a role for the epigenome?
PG	770-80
LID	10.1002/bdra.20807 [doi]
AB	Embryonic development under adverse conditions, such as maternal diabetes or obesity during pregnancy, constitutes a major risk factor for birth defects, as well as for long-term health consequences and disease susceptibility in the offspring. While contributions from epigenetic changes have been invoked previously to explain the long-term changes in terms of developmental programming, we here review how maternal metabolism may directly affect the embryonic epigenome in relationship to teratogenic processes. We consider four epigenetic modalities--DNA methylation, non-coding RNA, transcription factors, and histone modifications--and their contribution to epigenetic memory, and discuss how epigenomic changes may mediate the altered control of embryonic gene expression brought about by maternal diabetes. In combination, the epigenomic modalities serve to define transcription-permissive domains of the genome, resulting in distinct epigenomic landscapes in different developmental cell types. We evaluate experimental approaches to characterize the epigenome in adverse pregnancy conditions, highlighting the role of next-generation sequencing on the technological side, while emphasizing the necessity to study defined cell populations in terms of biologic impact. Finally, we outline the challenges in moving from findings that correlate epigenomics to developmental phenotypes to scenarios that establish teratogenic causality.

TI	Association of congenital cardiovascular malformations with 33 single nucleotide polymorphisms of selected cardiovascular disease-related genes.
PG	101-10
AB	INTRODUCTION: Clark (1996) proposed that abnormal blood flow is related to some congenital cardiovascular malformations (CCVMs), particularly CCVM with obstruction to blood flow. Our hypothesis is that CCVMs may relate to genes that affect blood coagulation or flow. We studied whether polymorphisms of such genes are related to CCVMs; previous association of these SNPs to conotruncal CCVMs is described. METHODS: We assessed risk of pulmonary stenosis (PS, N = 120), atrial septal defect (ASD, N = 108), aortic stenosis (AS, N = 36), and coarctation of the aorta (CoAo, N = 64), associated with 33 candidate genes, selected for their relationship to blood flow affected by homocysteine metabolism, coagulation, cell-cell interaction, inflammation, or blood pressure regulation. RESULTS: Effects were specific to cardiac phenotype and race. CoAo was associated with MTHFR (-667) C&gt;T (odds ratio [OR] for TT 3.5, 95% confidence limits [CI] 1.4-8.6). AS was associated with a polymorphism of SERPINE1, G5&gt;G4, OR = 5.6 for the homozygote with 95% CI 1.4-22.9. Unique polymorphisms were associated with increased risk of ASD and PS: NPPA 664G&gt;A with ASD (OR of 2.4, 95%CI 1.3-4.4) and NOS3 (-690) C&gt;T with PS (OR 6.1; 95% CI 1.6-22.6 in the African American population only). For ASD, the NPPA (-664) G&gt;A SNP there was increased risk from the variant genotype only in maternal smokers (OR 2.6; 95% CI 1.0-7.2). CONCLUSIONS: Genes affecting vascular function and coagulation appear to be promising candidates for the etiology of cardiac malformations and warrant further study.

TI	A family-based association study of congenital left-sided heart malformations and 5,10 methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase.
PG	825-30
AB	BACKGROUND: Aortic valve stenosis (AVS), coarctation of the aorta (CoA), and hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) are obstructive malformations of the left ventricular outflow tract that account for a significant proportion of infant mortality. Two previous small case-control studies suggested methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphisms may be associated with this group of malformations. METHODS: We used a family-based association design with inclusion criteria of nonsyndromic diagnosis of AVS, CoA, and HLHS, powered to detect an odds ratio for the heterozygote of &lt;1.5. A total of 207 affected offspring-parent trios were genotyped by restriction fragment length polymorphisms at the two common polymorphic loci C677T and A1298C. RESULTS: Error rate estimation based on replicate samples was 0.76%. Mendelian inconsistency at either polymorphism was noted in 10 trios, for a calculated undetected error rate of 1.95%. A total of 197 trios were analyzed using the transmission disequilibrium test. Significant association was not found between both the C677T or A1298C polymorphisms and presence of a heart defect, whether analyzed as a group, or by sex, ethnicity, or specific diagnosis. A log-linear analysis did not find increased relative risk based on the maternal genotype. CONCLUSIONS: We were unable to replicate previous association studies and concluded that neither the affected nor the maternal MTHFR genotype, by itself, is a major risk factor for congenital left ventricular outflow tract malformations.

TI	Shaping adult phenotypes through early life environments.
PG	314-26
AB	A major question in the biology of stress and environmental adaptation concerns the neurobiological basis of how neuroendocrine systems governing physiological regulatory mechanisms essential for life (metabolism, immune response, organ function) become harmful. The current view is that a switch from protection to damage occurs when vulnerable phenotypes are exposed to adverse environmental conditions. In accordance with this theory, sequelae of early life social and environmental stressors, such as childhood abuse, neglect, poverty, and poor nutrition, have been associated with the emergence of mental and physical illness (i.e., anxiety, mood disorders, poor impulse control, psychosis, and drug abuse) and an increased risk of common metabolic and cardiovascular diseases later in life. Evidence from animal and human studies investigating the associations between early life experiences (including parent-infant bonding), hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, brain development, and health outcome provide important clues into the neurobiological mechanisms that mediate the contribution of stressful experiences to personality development and the manifestation of illness. This review summarizes our current molecular understanding of how early environment influences brain development in a manner that persists through life and highlights recent evidence from rodent studies suggesting that maternal care in the first week of postnatal life establishes diverse and stable phenotypes in the offspring through epigenetic modification of genes expressed in the brain that shape neuroendocrine and behavioral stress responsivity throughout life.

TI	Developmental mismatch: consequences for later cardiorespiratory health.
PG	149-57
AB	Clinical and epidemiological studies have established that people who were small at birth and had poor infant growth have an increased risk of adult cardiovascular and respiratory disease, particularly if their restricted early growth is followed by accelerated childhood weight gain. This relationship extends across the normal range of infant size in a graded manner. The 'mismatch hypothesis' proposes that ill health in later life originates through developmental plastic responses made by the fetus and infant; these responses increase the risk of adult disease if the environment in childhood and adult life differs from that predicted during early development.

TI	A switch toward angiostatic gene expression impairs the angiogenic properties of endothelial progenitor cells in low birth weight preterm infants.
PG	1699-709
AB	Low birth weight (LBW) is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases at adulthood. Nevertheless, the impact of LBW on the endothelium is not clearly established. We investigate whether LBW alters the angiogenic properties of cord blood endothelial colony forming cells (LBW-ECFCs) in 25 preterm neonates compared with 25 term neonates (CT-ECFCs). We observed that LBW decreased the number of colonies formed by ECFCs and delayed the time of appearance of their clonal progeny. LBW dramatically reduced LBW-ECFC capacity to form sprouts and tubes, to migrate and to proliferate in vitro. The angiogenic defect of LBW-ECFCs was confirmed in vivo by their inability to form robust capillary networks in Matrigel plugs injected in nu/nu mice. Gene profile analysis of LBW-ECFCs demonstrated an increased expression of antiangiogenic genes. Among them, thrombospondin 1 (THBS1) was highly expressed at RNA and protein levels in LBW-ECFCs. Silencing THBS1 restored the angiogenic properties of LBW-ECFCs by increasing AKT phosphorylation. The imbalance toward an angiostatic state provide a mechanistic link between LBW and the impaired angiogenic properties of ECFCs and allows the identification of THBS1 as a novel player in LBW-ECFC defect, opening new perspectives for novel deprogramming agents.

TI	Impaired fibrinolysis as a risk factor for Budd-Chiari syndrome.
PG	388-95
AB	In Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS), thrombosis develops in the hepatic veins or inferior vena cava. To study the relationship between hypofibrinolysis and BCS, we measured plasma levels of fibrinolysis proteins in 101 BCS patients and 101 healthy controls and performed a plasma-based clot lysis assay. In BCS patients, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) levels were significantly higher than in controls (median, 6.3 vs 1.4 IU/mL, P &lt; .001). Thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor and plasmin inhibitor levels were lower than in controls (13.8 vs 16.9 microg/mL and 0.91 vs 1.02 U/L, both P &lt; .001). Median plasma clot lysis time (CLT) was 73.9 minutes in cases and 73.0 minutes in controls (P = .329). A subgroup of cases displayed clearly elevated CLTs. A CLT above the 90th or 95th percentile of controls was associated with an increased risk of BCS, with odds ratios of 2.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-5.5) and 3.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.2-9.7), respectively. In controls, only PAI-1 activity was significantly associated with CLT. Analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms of fibrinolysis proteins revealed no significant differences between cases and controls. This case-control study provides the first evidence that an impaired fibrinolytic potential, at least partially caused by elevated PAI-1 levels, is related to the presence of BCS.

TI	Identification of ZNF366 and PTPRD as novel determinants of plasma homocysteine in a family-based genome-wide association study.
PG	1417-22
AB	Total plasma homocysteine concentration (tHcy) is a biomarker for atherothrombotic disease, but causality remains uncertain. Polymorphisms in the genes involved in methionine metabolism explain only a small fraction of the heritability of tHcy levels. In a genome-wide association study, we examined the genetic determinants of tHcy using a 2-stage design. First, 283 437 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested for association with tHcy in 387 persons recruited from 21 large Spanish families. Of those, 17 SNPs showed equal or stronger association with tHcy level compared with the MTHFR 677C&gt;T SNP (beta = 0.10, P = .0001). Second, a replication analysis of these 17 SNPs was performed in patients with premature myocardial infarction (n = 1238). Novel associations were found for SNPs near the ZNF366 gene (lead SNP rs7445013; discovery stage: adjusted beta = -0.12, P = 5.30 x 10(-6), replication stage: adjusted beta = -0.13, P = .004) and the PTPRD gene (lead SNP rs973117; discovery stage: adjusted beta = 0.11, P = 5.5 x 10(-6), replication stage: adjusted beta = 0.10, P = .005). These associations were independent of known confounders, including creatinine clearance and plasma fibrinogen concentration. Our findings implicate novel pathways in homocysteine metabolism, and highlight the need for investigation of the associated genes in the etiology of vascular diseases.

TI	Fetal hemoglobin silencing in humans.
PG	2081-6
AB	Interruption of the normal fetal-to-adult transition of hemoglobin expression should largely ameliorate sickle cell and beta-thalassemia syndromes. Achievement of this clinical goal requires a robust understanding of gamma-globin gene and protein silencing during human development. For this purpose, age-related changes in globin phenotypes of circulating human erythroid cells were examined from 5 umbilical cords, 99 infants, and 5 adult donors. Unexpectedly, an average of 95% of the cord blood erythrocytes and reticulocytes expressed HbA and the adult beta-globin gene, as well as HbF and the gamma-globin genes. The distribution of hemoglobin and globin gene expression then changed abruptly due to the expansion of cells lacking HbF or gamma-globin mRNA (silenced cells). In adult reticulocytes, less than 5% expressed gamma-globin mRNA. These data are consistent with a &quot;switching&quot; model in humans that initially results largely from gamma	and beta-globin gene coexpression and competition during fetal development. In contrast, early postnatal life is marked by the rapid accumulation of cells that possess undetectable gamma-globin mRNA and HbF. The silencing phenomenon is mediated by a mechanism of cellular replacement. This novel silencing pattern may be important for the development of HbF-enhancing therapies.

TI	A large proportion of patients with a diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia do not have a clonal disorder and may be at lower risk of thrombotic complications.
PG	417-24
AB	Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is traditionally considered to be a clonal disorder. No specific karyotypic abnormalities have been described, but the demonstration of clonality using X-chromosome inactivation patterns (XCIPs) has been used to differentiate ET from a non-clonal reactive thrombocytosis. However, these assays may be difficult to interpret, and contradictory results have been reported. We have studied 46 females with a diagnosis of ET according to the Polycythemia Vera Study Group (PVSG) criteria. XCIP results in 23 patients (50%) were uninterpretable due to either constitutive or possible acquired age-related skewing. Monoclonal myelopoiesis could be definitively shown in only 10 patients. Thirteen patients had polyclonal myelopoiesis, and in 8, it was possible to exclude clonal restriction to the megakaryocytic lineage. Furthermore, there was no evidence of clonal progenitors in purified CD34(+)CD33(-) and CD34(+)CD33(+) subpopulations from bone marrow of 2 of these 13 patients. There was no difference between patients with monoclonal and polyclonal myelopoiesis with respect to age or platelet count at diagnosis, duration of follow-up, incidence of hepatosplenomegaly, or hemorrhagic complications. However, polyclonal patients were less likely to have experienced thrombotic events (P =.039). These results suggest that ET is a heterogeneous disorder, and the clinical significance of clonality status warrants investigation in a larger study.

TI	Prothrombin G20210A mutant genotype is a risk factor for cerebrovascular ischemic disease in young patients.
PG	3562-5
AB	The factor II G20210A mutation is a recently identified congenital risk factor for venous thrombosis. Its role in artery disease is still undefined. We investigated 72 patients (35 male and 37 female) with documented ischemic stroke occurred before 50 years of age and without risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia; 198 thrombosis-free individuals were investigated as the control group. We found 7 heterozygotes (9.7%) and 2 homozygotes (2.7%) for the mutant factor II allele among the patients and 5 heterozygotes (2.5%) among the controls; the mutant factor II allele frequency in the patient group (7.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.3 to 11.9) was significantly higher than in the controls (1.2%; 95% CI, 0.1 to 2.3; P = .0001). The prevalence of other investigated mutant alleles (factor V G1691A, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T) did not significantly differ between the two groups. The odds ratio for ischemic stroke associated with the carriership of the mutant factor II allele (both heterozygous and homozygous genotypes) was 5.1 (95% CI, 1.6 to 16.3). Heterozygous genotype was associated with a 3.8-fold increased risk for cerebral ischemia (95% CI, 1.1 to 13.1); in particular, assuming an expected prevalence of homozygotes in the general population of 1.6 to 10,000 according to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the risk associated with the homozygous genotype was estimated exceedingly high, being increased 208-fold.

TI	-455G/A beta-fibrinogen gene polymorphism, factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A mutation and MTHFR C677T, and placental vascular complications.
PG	139-47
AB	Hyperfibrinogenaemia is associated with systemic arterial and venous thromboembolism and therefore may contribute to placental vascular disease associated with obstetric complications. The fibrinogen-raising -455G/A beta-fibrinogen gene polymorphism may enhance the physiological increase in fibrinogen levels during pregnancy and thereby predispose to obstetric complications. This retrospective case-control study looked at the association between the beta-fibrinogen gene polymorphism -455G/A, the hereditary thrombophilic markers factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A mutation (PGM) and C677T methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), and obstetric complications associated with placental vascular disease. The study group (n = 247) comprised 147 women (90 Caucasian) who met the clinical criteria and a control group of 100 parous women (90 Caucasian) with no history of obstetric or medical complications. No significant differences were observed in the -455A allelic frequencies of the patient and normal control groups, with (allelic frequencies, 0.156 and 0.178, respectively; P = 0.5716, chi2 test, odds ratio = 1.17, 95% confidence interval = 0.65-2.13) or without (allelic frequencies, 0.129 and 0.170, respectively; P = 0.2077, chi2 test, odds ratio = 1.38, 95% confidence interval = 0.81-2.35) the exclusion of non-Caucasian women. There was an increased prevalence of factor V Leiden among Caucasian patients compared with normal controls (allelic frequencies, 0.056 and 0.017, respectively; P = 0.048, chi2 test, odds ratio = 0.29, 95% confidence interval = 0.05-1.15) but there were no differences in the prevalences of PGM or MTHFR. These data suggest that factor V Leiden is associated with an increased risk of obstetric complications, but that the -455A allele of beta-fibrinogen, PGM and MTHFR do not appear to be implicated.

TI	Mutations C677T and A1298C of the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene and fasting plasma homocysteine levels are not associated with the increased risk of venous thromboembolic disease.
PG	423-31
AB	Mild hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with homozygosity for the thermolabile variant of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and could increase the risk of venous thromboembolic disease (VTD). Recently, the second A1298C mutation of the MTHFR gene was described. The present study aimed to analyze both mutations of the MTHFR gene and plasma homocysteine levels in subjects with VTD. The study groups comprised 146 patients with VTD and 100 healthy subjects. There were no statistical differences in carrier frequency and allelic frequency for both A1298C and C677T mutations, nor were there any differences encountered between subjects with VTD and controls in either plasma homocysteine levels or according to C677T or A1298C genotypes of MTHFR. In our VTD patients and controls, neither MTHFR 677CT/1298CC nor MTHFR 677TT/1298CC combined genotypes were observed; double heterozygotes (A1298C/C677T) were represented only in 11% of VTD patients, and in 15% of the controls. In conclusion, the polymorphisms C677T and A1298C of MTHFR and fasting plasma homocysteine levels do not seem to be significant risk factors for venous thromboembolic disease.

TI	Hyperhomocysteinemia increases the risk of venous thrombosis independent of the C677T mutation of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene in selected Brazilian patients.
PG	271-5
AB	Fasting total homocysteine (tHcy) and the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T mutation were evaluated in 91 patients with venous thromboembolism and without acquired thrombophilia, and in 91 age-matched and sex-matched controls. Hyperhomocysteinemia was detected in 11 patients (12.1%) and in two controls (2.2%), yielding an odds ratio (OR) for venous thrombosis of 6.1 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.3-28.4]. After excluding 21 patients and four controls with other known genetic risk factors for venous thrombosis, the OR was not substantially changed (7.0; 95% CI, 1.5-33.1). The prevalence of the MTHFR 677TT genotype was not significantly different in patients (9.9%) and in controls (5.5%), with an OR for venous thrombosis of 1.8 (95% CI, 0.6-5.8). Subjects with the MTHFR 677TT genotype showed higher levels of tHcy compared with the 677CC genotype in patients (P = 0.010) and in controls (P = 0.030). In conclusion, we found that fasting hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor for venous thrombosis in patients without known acquired thrombophilia and other genetic risk factors for venous thrombosis. Although tHcy levels are significantly higher in those homozygous for the MTHFR C677T mutation, this genotype does not increase the thrombotic risk in our study population.

TI	Risk of venous thromboembolism associated with the insertion/deletion polymorphism in the angiotensin-converting enzyme gene.
PG	485-90
AB	The circulating levels of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) are linked with a 287-base pair insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism at intron 16 of the ACE gene. Thus, the homozygous deletion (D/D genotype) could cause chronic vasoconstriction, arterial hypertension and, possibly, coronary artery disease. Also, the increase in plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 level and impaired fibrinolysis were related with the D/D genotype. The D allele has been recently associated with venous thrombosis among African-American men as well as among patients that underwent elective total hip replacement. We assess the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) linked with each genotype of the I/D ACE gene polymorphism in a Caucasian population by means of a case-control study. We genotyped the ACE gene in a series of 148 patients aged 45.0 +/	16.0 years (range, 11-80 years), objectively diagnosed in our centre of deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and in 240 thrombosis-free subjects (25-75 years) from the same geographic area. The observed difference in D allele frequencies between patients (0.56) and controls (0.62) was nonsignificant overall; however, statistical significance (P = 0.05) was found by considering the recessive hypothesis (D/D versus I/ D + I/I) [odds ratio (OR) = 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI95) = 0.42-0.99]. The OR was 0.88 (CI95 = 0.51-1.53; P = 0.65) for the dominant hypothesis (D/D + I/D versus I/I genotypes). The relative risk for the D allele was close to 1 for the dominant hypothesis, both considering gender and recurrent tendency; however, it was protective in men regarding the recessive hypothesis (OR = 0.53, CI95 = 0.29-0.97, P = 0.04). The I/D ACE allele distribution was similar among the 46 thrombophilic patients (antithrombin, protein C or protein S deficiencies, factor V R506Q, factor II G20210A or lupus anticoagulant). In conclusion, among (Spanish) Caucasians, this study does not support the hypothesis that the deletion allele (D) of the ACE gene could be a significant risk factor for VTE, being protective in men.

TI	No evidence for an increased risk of venous thrombosis in patients with factor V Leiden by the homozygous 677 C to T mutation in the methylenetetrahydrofolate-reductase gene.
PG	101-5
AB	Hyperhomocysteinemia is an established risk factor for arterial and venous thrombosis. Recently, it has been shown that a C to T mutation at nt position 677 in the methylenetetrahydrofolate-reductase (MTHFR) gene is a common cause of moderately elevated levels of plasma homocysteine in adults. In order to investigate whether the newly recognized genetic alteration in the MTHFR gene potentiates the thrombotic tendency in patients with factor V Leiden, we studied 81 unrelated patients with a history of venous thrombosis and a heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation. In addition, we analyzed 111 family members of 34 families in which the proband had a heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation. In all individuals, factor V Leiden and the MTHFR mutation were tested and the occurrence of venous thrombotic events was evaluated retrospectively. Seventy-seven healthy subjects without the factor V Leiden mutation or any other known thrombotic risk factor served as a control group. The prevalence of the homozygous MTHFR mutation was similar in index patients (10 of 81, 12%) and in the control group (10 of 77, 13%). The median age at first thrombosis in index patients was 32 years (range 22-69 years) in 10 patients with heterozygous factor V Leiden and T/T MTHFR mutation, and 34 years (range 6-72 years) in 71 patients with the factor V Leiden mutation only. In the family members, the prevalence of thrombosis was not higher in patients with factor V Leiden and +/+ MTHFR genotype than in those with only the heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation. We conclude from these data that the 677 C to T mutation in the MTHFR gene does not represent a significant additional risk factor for venous thrombosis in patients with factor V Leiden mutation.

TI	Association of TGF-beta1 gene polymorphisms in exon1 and blood levels with essential hypertension.
PG	225-33
AB	AIMS: Based on a case-control study, we investigated the relationship between +869T/C and +915G/C gene polymorphisms in transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), protein levels and essential hypertension (EH) in the Kazakh and Han Chinese populations selected from the Boertonggu countryside of Shawan region in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China (n=1600). The polymorphisms of TGF-beta1 and the blood levels were detected using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assays and sandwich ELISA, respectively. MAJOR FINDINGS: An association was found between +869C-allele with higher risk of EH in these two populations. We also found that the CG haplotype of the two polymorphisms was associated with EH in the Kazakh EH patients. The levels of TGF-beta(1) in the blood were positively correlated with diastolic blood pressure both in the Kazakh and Han EH patients. Levels of the TGF-beta1 protein in the Kazakh EH patients were significantly higher than those in the Han EH patients. PRINCIPAL CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the TGF-beta1 +869 C allele is potentially a genetic factor of EH in these two ethnicities, the CG haplotype can be a genetic marker of EH in the Kazakh Chinese and the high concentration of TGF-beta1 is possibly associated with EH, especially in the Kazakh population.

TI	Disease progression and search for monogenic diabetes among children with new onset type 1 diabetes negative for ICA, GAD	and IA-2 Antibodies.
PG	16
AB	BACKGROUND: To investigate disease progression the first 12 months after diagnosis in children with type 1 diabetes negative (AAB negative) for pancreatic autoantibodies [islet cell autoantibodies(ICA), glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (GADA) and insulinoma-associated antigen-2 antibodies (IA-2A)]. Furthermore the study aimed at determining whether mutations in KCNJ11, ABCC8, HNF1A, HNF4A or INS are common in AAB negative diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 261 newly diagnosed children with type 1 diabetes, we measured residual beta-cell function, ICA, GADA, and IA-2A at 1, 6 and 12 months after diagnosis. The genes KCNJ11, ABCC8, HNF1A, HNF4A and INS were sequenced in subjects AAB negative at diagnosis. We expressed recombinant K-ATP channels in Xenopus oocytes to analyse the functional effects of an ABCC8 mutation. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (9.1%) tested AAB negative after one month. Patients, who were AAB-negative throughout the 12-month period, had higher residual beta-cell function (P = 0.002), lower blood glucose (P = 0.004), received less insulin (P = 0.05) and had lower HbA1c (P = 0.02) 12 months after diagnosis. One patient had a heterozygous mutation leading to the substitution of arginine at residue 1530 of SUR1 (ABCC8) by cysteine. Functional analyses of recombinant K-ATP channels showed that R1530C markedly reduced the sensitivity of the K-ATP channel to inhibition by MgATP. Morover, the channel was highly sensitive to sulphonylureas. However, there was no effect of sulfonylurea treatment after four weeks on 1.0-1.2 mg/kg/24 h glibenclamide. CONCLUSION: GAD, IA-2A, and ICA negative children with new onset type 1 diabetes have slower disease progression as assessed by residual beta-cell function and improved glycemic control 12 months after diagnosis. One out of 24 had a mutation in ABCC8, suggesting that screening of ABCC8 should be considered in patients with AAB negative type 1 diabetes.

TI	Multiple forms of atypical rearrangements generating supernumerary derivative chromosome 15.
PG	2
AB	BACKGROUND: Maternally-derived duplications that include the imprinted region on the proximal long arm of chromosome 15 underlie a complex neurobehavioral disorder characterized by cognitive impairment, seizures and a substantial risk for autism spectrum disorders1. The duplications most often take the form of a supernumerary pseudodicentric derivative chromosome 15 [der(15)] that has been called inverted duplication 15 or isodicentric 15 [idic(15)], although interstitial rearrangements also occur. Similar to the deletions found in most cases of Angelman and Prader Willi syndrome, the duplications appear to be mediated by unequal homologous recombination involving low copy repeats (LCR) that are found clustered in the region. Five recurrent breakpoints have been described in most cases of segmental aneuploidy of chromosome 15q11-q13 and previous studies have shown that most idic(15) chromosomes arise through BP3:BP3 or BP4:BP5 recombination events. RESULTS: Here we describe four duplication chromosomes that show evidence of atypical recombination events that involve regions outside the common breakpoints. Additionally, in one patient with a mosaic complex der(15), we examined homologous pairing of chromosome 15q11-q13 alleles by FISH in a region of frontal cortex, which identified mosaicism in this tissue and also demonstrated pairing of the signals from the der(15) and the normal homologues. CONCLUSION: Involvement of atypical BP in the generation of idic(15) chromosomes can lead to considerable structural heterogeneity.

TI	Lemierre's syndrome and genetic polymorphisms: a case report.
PG	115
AB	BACKGROUND: Lemierre's syndrome presents a classic clinical picture, the pathophysiology of which remains obscure. Attempts have been made to trace genetic predispositions that modify the host detection of pathogen or the resultant systemic reaction. CASE PRESENTATION: A 17-year old female, with no previous medical history, was admitted to the intensive care unit for septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome and Lemierre's syndrome. Her DNA was assayed for single nucleotide polymorphisms previously incriminated in the detection of the pathogen, the inflammatory response and the coagulation cascade. We observed functional variations in her Toll like 5 receptor (TLR 5) gene and two coagulation variations (Tissue Factor (TF) 603 and Plasminogen-Activator-Inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) 4G-4G homozygosity) associated with thrombotic events. CONCLUSION: The innate immune response and the prothrombogenic mutations could explain, at least in part, the symptoms of Lemierre's syndrome. Genomic study of several patients with Lemierre's syndrome may reveal its pathophysiology.

TI	Epigenetics and obesity: the devil is in the details.
PG	88
AB	Obesity is a complex disease with multiple well-defined risk factors. Nevertheless, susceptibility to obesity and its sequelae within obesogenic environments varies greatly from one person to the next, suggesting a role for gene x environment interactions in the etiology of the disorder. Epigenetic regulation of the human genome provides a putative mechanism by which specific environmental exposures convey risk for obesity and other human diseases and is one possible mechanism that underlies the gene x environment/treatment interactions observed in epidemiological studies and clinical trials. A study published in BMC Medicine this month by Wang et al. reports on an examination of DNA methylation in peripheral blood leukocytes of lean and obese adolescents, comparing methylation patterns between the two groups. The authors identified two genes that were differentially methylated, both of which have roles in immune function. Here we overview the findings from this study in the context of those emerging from other recent genetic and epigenetic studies, discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the study and speculate on the future of epigenetics in chronic disease research.

TI	Obesity related methylation changes in DNA of peripheral blood leukocytes.
PG	87
AB	BACKGROUND: Despite evidence linking obesity to impaired immune function, little is known about the specific mechanisms. Because of emerging evidence that immune responses are epigenetically regulated, we hypothesized that DNA methylation changes are involved in obesity induced immune dysfunction and aimed to identify these changes. METHOD: We conducted a genome wide methylation analysis on seven obese cases and seven lean controls aged 14 to 18 years from extreme ends of the obesity distribution and performed further validation of six CpG sites from six genes in 46 obese cases and 46 lean controls aged 14 to 30 years. RESULTS: In comparison with the lean controls, we observed one CpG site in the UBASH3A gene showing higher methylation levels and one CpG site in the TRIM3 gene showing lower methylation levels in the obese cases in both the genome wide step (P = 5 x 10(-6) and P = 2 x 10(-5) for the UBASH3A and the TRIM3 gene respectively) and the validation step (P = 0.008 and P = 0.001 for the UBASH3A and the TRIM3 gene respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence that obesity is associated with methylation changes in blood leukocyte DNA. Further studies are warranted to determine the causal direction of this relationship as well as whether such methylation changes can lead to immune dysfunction.

TI	Parental ages and levels of DNA methylation in the newborn are correlated.
PG	47
AB	BACKGROUND: Changes in DNA methylation patterns with age frequently have been observed and implicated in the normal aging process and its associated increasing risk of disease, particularly cancer. Additionally, the offspring of older parents are at significantly increased risk of cancer, diabetes, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Only a proportion of these increased risks among the children of older parents can be attributed to nondisjunction and chromosomal rearrangements. RESULTS: Using a genome-wide survey of 27,578 CpG dinucleotides in a cohort of 168 newborns, we examined the relationship between DNA methylation in newborns and a variety of parental and newborn traits. We found that methylation levels of 144 CpGs belonging to 142 genes were significantly correlated with maternal age. A weaker correlation was observed with paternal age. Among these genes, processes related to cancer were over-represented, as were functions related to neurological regulation, glucose/carbohydrate metabolism, nucleocytoplasmic transport, and transcriptional regulation. CpGs exhibiting gender differences in methylation were overwhelmingly located on the X chromosome, although a small subset of autosomal CpGs were found in genes previously shown to exhibit gender-specific differences in methylation levels. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that there are differences in CpG methylation levels at birth that are related to parental age and that could influence disease risk in childhood and throughout life.

TI	Suggestive evidence of associations between liver X receptor beta polymorphisms with type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity in three cohort studies: HUNT2 (Norway), MONICA (France) and HELENA (Europe).
PG	144
AB	BACKGROUND: The liver X receptors (LXR) alpha and beta regulate lipid and carbohydrate homeostasis and inflammation. Lxrbeta/ mice are glucose intolerant and at the same time lean. We aimed to assess the associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in LXRbeta and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obesity and related traits in 3 separate cohort studies. METHODS: Twenty LXRbeta SNPs were identified by sequencing and genotyped in the HUNT2 adult nested case-control study for T2DM (n = 835 cases/1986 controls). Five tag-SNPs (rs17373080, rs2695121, rs56151148, rs2303044 and rs3219281), covering 99.3% of the entire common genetic variability of the LXRbeta gene were identified and genotyped in the French MONICA adult study (n = 2318) and the European adolescent HELENA cross-sectional study (n = 1144). In silico and in vitro functionality studies were performed. RESULTS: We identified suggestive or significant associations between rs17373080 and the risk of (i) T2DM in HUNT2 (OR = 0.82, p = 0.03), (ii) obesity in MONICA (OR = 1.26, p = 0.05) and (iii) overweight/obesity in HELENA (OR = 1.59, p = 0.002). An intron 4 SNP (rs28514894, a perfect proxy for rs17373080) could potentially create binding sites for hepatic nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4alpha) and nuclear factor 1 (NF1). The C allele of rs28514894 was associated with ~1.25-fold higher human LXRbeta basal promoter activity in vitro. However, no differences between alleles in terms of DNA binding and reporter gene transactivation by HNF4alpha or NF1 were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that rs17373080 in LXRbeta is associated with T2DM and obesity, maybe via altered LXRbeta expression.

TI	Large-scale association analysis of TNF/LTA gene region polymorphisms in type 2 diabetes.
PG	69
AB	BACKGROUND: The TNF/LTA locus has been a long-standing T2D candidate gene. Several studies have examined association of TNF/LTA SNPs with T2D but the majority have been small-scale and produced no convincing evidence of association. The purpose of this study is to examine T2D association of tag SNPs in the TNF/LTA region capturing the majority of common variation in a large-scale sample set of UK/Irish origin. METHODS: This study comprised a case-control (1520 cases and 2570 control samples) and a family-based component (423 parent-offspring trios). Eleven tag SNPs (rs928815, rs909253, rs746868, rs1041981 (T60N), rs1800750, rs1800629 (G-308A), rs361525 (G-238A), rs3093662, rs3093664, rs3093665, and rs3093668) were selected across the TNF/LTA locus and genotyped using a fluorescence-based competitive allele specific assay. Quality control of the obtained genotypes was performed prior to single	and multi-point association analyses under the additive model. RESULTS: We did not find any consistent SNP associations with T2D in the case-control or family-based datasets. CONCLUSIONS: The present study, designed to analyse a set of tag SNPs specifically selected to capture the majority of common variation in the TNF/LTA gene region, found no robust evidence for association with T2D. To investigate the presence of smaller effects of TNF/LTA gene variation with T2D, a large-scale meta-analysis will be required.

TI	Maternal angiotensinogen (AGT) haplotypes, fetal renin (REN) haplotypes and risk of preeclampsia; estimation of gene-gene interaction from family-triad data.
PG	90
AB	BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia is a debilitating disorder affecting approximately 3% of pregnant women in the Western world. Although inconclusive, current evidence suggests that the renin-angiotensin system may be involved in hypertension. Therefore, our objective was to determine whether the genes for placental renin (REN) and maternal angiotensinogen (AGT) interact to influence the risk of preeclampsia. METHODS: Three haplotype-tagging SNPs (htSNPs) covering REN (rs5705, rs1464818, and rs3795575) and another three covering AGT (rs2148582, rs2478545 and rs943580) were genotyped in 99 mother-father-child triads of preeclampsia pregnancies. We estimated relative risks (RR) conferred by maternal AGT and fetal REN haplotypes using HAPLIN, a statistical software designed to detect multi-marker transmission distortion among triads. To assess a combined effect of maternal AGT and fetal REN haplotypes, the preeclamptic triads were first stratified by presence/absence of maternal AGT haplotype C-T-A and tested for an effect of fetal REN across these strata. RESULTS: We found evidence that mothers carrying the most frequent AGT haplotype, C-T-A, had a reduced risk of preeclampsia (RR of 0.4, 95% CI = 0.2-0.8 for heterozygotes and 0.6, 95% CI = 0.2-1.5 for homozygotes). Mothers homozygous for AGT haplotypes t-c-g and C-c-g appeared to have a higher risk, but only the former was statistically significant. We found only weak evidence of an overall effect of fetal REN haplotypes and no support for our hypothesis that an effect of REN depended on whether the mother carried the C-T-A haplotype of AGT (p = 0.33). CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the mother's AGT haplotypes affect her risk for developing preeclampsia. However, this risk is not influenced by fetal REN haplotypes.

TI	Large effects on body mass index and insulin resistance of fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) variants in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
PG	12
AB	BACKGROUND: The polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common endocrine disorder in women of child-bearing age, mainly characterised by chronic anovulation and hyperandrogenism, is often associated with insulin resistance (IR) and obesity. Its etiology and the role of IR and obesity in PCOS are not fully understood. We examined the influence of validated genetic variants conferring susceptibility to obesity and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on metabolic and PCOS-specific traits in patients with PCOS. METHODS: We conducted an association study in 386 patients with PCOS (defined by the Rotterdam-criteria) using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in or in proximity to the fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO), insulin-induced gene-2 (INSIG2), transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2) and melanocortin 4 receptor gene (MC4R). To compare the effect of FTO obesity risk alleles on BMI in patients with PCOS to unselected females of the same age range we genotyped 1,971 females from the population-based KORA-S4 study (Kooperative Gesundheitsforschung im Raum Augsburg, Survey 4). RESULTS: The FTO risk allele was associated with IR traits and measures of increased body weight. In addition, the TCF7L2 SNP was associated with body weight traits. For the SNPs in the vicinity of INSIG2 and MC4R and for the other examined phenotypes there was no evidence for an association. In PCOS the observed per risk allele effect of FTO intron 1 SNP rs9939609 on BMI was +1.56 kg/m2, whereas it was +0.46 kg/m2 in females of the same age range from the general population as shown previously. CONCLUSION: The stronger effect on body weight of the FTO SNP in PCOS might well have implications for the etiology of the disease.

TI	Gene polymorphisms in association with emerging cardiovascular risk markers in adult women.
PG	6
AB	BACKGROUND: Evidence on the associations of emerging cardiovascular disease risk factors/markers with genes may help identify intermediate pathways of disease susceptibility in the general population. This population-based study is aimed to determine the presence of associations between a wide array of genetic variants and emerging cardiovascular risk markers among adult US women. METHODS: The current analysis was performed among the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III phase 2 samples of adult women aged 17 years and older (sample size n = 3409). Fourteen candidate genes within ADRB2, ADRB3, CAT, CRP, F2, F5, FGB, ITGB3, MTHFR, NOS3, PON1, PPARG, TLR4, and TNF were examined for associations with emerging cardiovascular risk markers such as serum C-reactive protein, homocysteine, uric acid, and plasma fibrinogen. Linear regression models were performed using SAS-callable SUDAAN 9.0. The covariates included age, race/ethnicity, education, menopausal status, female hormone use, aspirin use, and lifestyle factors. RESULTS: In covariate-adjusted models, serum C-reactive protein concentrations were significantly (P value controlling for false-discovery rate &lt; or = 0.05) associated with polymorphisms in CRP (rs3093058, rs1205), MTHFR (rs1801131), and ADRB3 (rs4994). Serum homocysteine levels were significantly associated with MTHFR (rs1801133). CONCLUSION: The significant associations between certain gene variants with concentration variations in serum C-reactive protein and homocysteine among adult women need to be confirmed in further genetic association studies.

TI	Genetic association study of selected candidate genes (ApoB, LPL, Leptin) and telomere length in obese and hypertensive individuals.
PG	99
AB	BACKGROUND: A genetic study was carried out among obese and hypertensive individuals from India to assess allelic association, if any, at three candidate loci: Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) minisatellite and two tetranucleotide repeat loci; LPL (Lipoprotein lipase) and Leptin. Attempt has also been made to find out whether telomere length attrition is associated with hypertension and obese individuals. METHODS: Venous blood samples were collected from 37 normal, 35 obese and 47 hypertensive individuals. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and PCR amplifications were achieved using locus specific primers. Genotyping of ApoB minisatellite was performed using 4% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by silver staining, whereas LPL and Leptin loci were genotyped using ALF Express DNA sequencer. Telomere length was determined using a recently developed real time based quantitative PCR, where the relative telomere length was determined by calculating the relative ratio of telomere (T) and single copy gene (S) PCR products which is expressed as T/S ratio. RESULTS: All the three loci are highly polymorphic, display high heterozygosity and conform to Hardy-Weinberg's equilibrium expectations. ApoB minisatellite displayed 14 alleles, whereas LPL and Leptin tetranucleotide loci were having 9 and 17 alleles, respectively. Interestingly two new alleles (9 and 11 repeats) were detected at ApoB locus for the first time. The alleles at Leptin locus were classified as Class I (lower alleles: 149-200 bp) and Class II alleles (higher alleles: &gt;217 bp). Higher alleles at ApoB (&gt;39 repeats), predominant allele 9 at LPL and alleles 164 bp and 224 bp at Leptin loci have shown allelic association with hypertensive individuals. After adjusting the influence of age and gender, the analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA) revealed the relative telomere length (T/S ratio) in hypertensive individuals to be (1.01 +/	0.021), which was significantly different (P &lt; 0.001) from obese (1.20 +/	0.023) and normal (1.22 +/	0.014) individuals. However, no significant difference in the relative telomere length was observed among male and female individuals, although age related decrease in telomere length was observed in these limited sample size. CONCLUSION: The present study revealed that allelic association at ApoB, LPL, Leptin loci and loss of telomere length may have strong genetic association with hypertensive individuals. However, further study on larger sample size is needed to draw firm conclusions.

TI	118 SNPs of folate-related genes and risks of spina bifida and conotruncal heart defects.
PG	49
AB	BACKGROUND: Folic acid taken in early pregnancy reduces risks for delivering offspring with several congenital anomalies. The mechanism by which folic acid reduces risk is unknown. Investigations into genetic variation that influences transport and metabolism of folate will help fill this data gap. We focused on 118 SNPs involved in folate transport and metabolism. METHODS: Using data from a California population-based registry, we investigated whether risks of spina bifida or conotruncal heart defects were influenced by 118 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the complex folate pathway. This case-control study included 259 infants with spina bifida and a random sample of 359 nonmalformed control infants born during 1983-86 or 1994-95. It also included 214 infants with conotruncal heart defects born during 1983-86. Infant genotyping was performed blinded to case or control status using a designed SNPlex assay. We examined single SNP effects for each of the 118 SNPs, as well as haplotypes, for each of the two outcomes. RESULTS: Few odds ratios (ORs) revealed sizable departures from 1.0. With respect to spina bifida, we observed ORs with 95% confidence intervals that did not include 1.0 for the following SNPs (heterozygous or homozygous) relative to the reference genotype: BHMT (rs3733890) OR = 1.8 (1.1-3.1), CBS (rs2851391) OR = 2.0 (1.2-3.1); CBS (rs234713) OR = 2.9 (1.3-6.7); MTHFD1 (rs2236224) OR = 1.7 (1.1-2.7); MTHFD1 (hcv11462908) OR = 0.2 (0-0.9); MTHFD2 (rs702465) OR = 0.6 (0.4-0.9); MTHFD2 (rs7571842) OR = 0.6 (0.4-0.9); MTHFR (rs1801133) OR = 2.0 (1.2-3.1); MTRR (rs162036) OR = 3.0 (1.5-5.9); MTRR (rs10380) OR = 3.4 (1.6-7.1); MTRR (rs1801394) OR = 0.7 (0.5-0.9); MTRR (rs9332) OR = 2.7 (1.3-5.3); TYMS (rs2847149) OR = 2.2 (1.4-3.5); TYMS (rs1001761) OR = 2.4 (1.5-3.8); and TYMS (rs502396) OR = 2.1 (1.3-3.3). However, multiple SNPs observed for a given gene showed evidence of linkage disequilibrium indicating that the observed SNPs were not individually contributing to risk. We did not observe any ORs with confidence intervals that did not include 1.0 for any of the studied SNPs with conotruncal heart defects. Haplotype reconstruction showed statistical evidence of nonrandom associations with TYMS, MTHFR, BHMT and MTR for spina bifida. CONCLUSION: Our observations do not implicate a particular folate transport or metabolism gene to be strongly associated with risks for spina bifida or conotruncal defects.

TI	Type 2 diabetes gene TCF7L2 polymorphism is not associated with fetal and postnatal growth in two birth cohort studies.
PG	67
AB	BACKGROUND: An inverse association between birth weight and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D) in adulthood has been reported. This association may be explained by common genetic variants related to insulin secretion and resistance, since insulin is the most important growth factor in fetal life. The objective of this study was to examine whether T2D gene polymorphism TCF7L2 rs7903146 is associated with growth patterns from fetal life until infancy. METHODS: This study was performed in two independent birth cohort studies, one prospective population-based (Generation R), and one of subjects born small-for-gestational-age (SGA cohort). Fetal growth was assessed by ultrasounds in second and third trimesters of pregnancy in Generation R. Growth in infancy was assessed in both cohorts at birth and at 6, 12 and 24 months postnatally. TCF7L2 genotype was determined in 3,419 subjects in Generation R and in 566 subjects in the SGA cohort. RESULTS: Minor allele frequency did not differ significantly (p = 0.47) between Generation R (T-allele: 28.7%) and the SGA cohort (T-allele: 29.8%). No differences at birth were found in gestational age or size (head circumference, length, weight) between the genotypes in either cohort. TCF7L2 genotype was also not associated with any pre	or postnatal growth characteristic in either Generation R or the SGA cohort. CONCLUSION: We found no evidence for an association between TCF7L2 genotype and fetal and early postnatal growth. Furthermore, this TCF7L2 polymorphism was not associated with an increased risk of SGA.

TI	Association of hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha gene polymorphism with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes in a Caucasian (Hungarian) sample.
PG	79
AB	BACKGROUND: Hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) is a transcription factor that plays an important role in neo-vascularisation, embryonic pancreas beta-cell mass development, and beta cell protection. Recently a non synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (g.C45035T SNP, rs11549465) of HIF-1alpha gene, resulting in the p.P582S amino acid change has been shown to be associated with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in a Japanese population. Our aim was to replicate these findings on a Caucasian (Hungarian) population, as well as to study whether this genetic effect is restricted to T2DM or can be expanded to diabetes in general. METHODS: A large Caucasian sample (N = 890) was recruited including 370 T2DM, 166 T1DM and 354 healthy subjects. Genotyping was validated by two independent methods: a restriction fragment analysis (RFLP) and a real time PCR using TaqMan probes. An overestimation of heterozygotes by RFLP was observed as a consequence of a nearby SNP (rs34005929). Therefore genotyping results of the justified TaqMan system were accepted. The measured genotype distribution corresponded to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P = 0.740) RESULTS: As the TT genotype was extremely rare in the population (0.6% in clinical sample and 2.5% in controls), the genotypes were grouped as T absent (CC) and T present (CT and TT). Genotype-wise analysis showed a significant increase of T present group in controls (24.0%) as compared to patients (16.8%, P = 0.008). This genetic effect was demonstrated in the separated samples of type 1 (15.1%, P = 0.020), and also in type 2 (17.6%, P = 0.032) diabetes. Allele-wise analysis gave identical results showing a higher frequency of the T allele in the control sample (13.3%) than in the clinical sample (8.7%, P = 0.002) with similar results in type 1 (7.8%, P = 0.010) and type 2 (9.1%, P = 0.011) diabetes. The odds ratio for diabetes (either type 1 or 2) was 1.56 in the presence of the C allele. CONCLUSION: We confirmed the protective effect of a rare genetic variant of HIF-1alpha gene against type 2 diabetes in a Caucasian sample. Moreover we demonstrated a genetic contribution of the same polymorphism in type 1 diabetes as well, supporting a possible overlap in pathomechanism for T2DM and a T1DM.

TI	Genome-wide association to body mass index and waist circumference: the Framingham Heart Study 100K project.
PG	S18
AB	BACKGROUND: Obesity is related to multiple cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors as well as CVD and has a strong familial component. We tested for association between SNPs on the Affymetrix 100K SNP GeneChip and measures of adiposity in the Framingham Heart Study. METHODS: A total of 1341 Framingham Heart Study participants in 310 families genotyped with the Affymetrix 100K SNP GeneChip had adiposity traits measured over 30 years of follow up. Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), weight change, height, and radiographic measures of adiposity (subcutaneous adipose tissue, visceral adipose tissue, waist circumference, sagittal height) were measured at multiple examination cycles. Multivariable-adjusted residuals, adjusting for age, age-squared, sex, smoking, and menopausal status, were evaluated in association with the genotype data using additive Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) and Family Based Association Test (FBAT) models. We prioritized mean BMI over offspring examinations (1-7) and cohort examinations (10, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26) and mean WC over offspring examinations (4-7) for presentation. We evaluated associations with 70,987 SNPs on autosomes with minor allele frequencies of at least 0.10, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p &gt; or = 0.001, and call rates of at least 80%. RESULTS: The top SNPs to be associated with mean BMI and mean WC by GEE were rs110683 (p-value 1.22*10(-7)) and rs4471028 (p-values 1.96*10(-7)). Please see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?id=phs000007 webcite for the complete set of results. We were able to validate SNPs in known genes that have been related to BMI or other adiposity traits, including the ESR1 Xba1 SNP, PPARG, and ADIPOQ. CONCLUSION: Adiposity traits are associated with SNPs on the Affymetrix 100K SNP GeneChip. Replication of these initial findings is necessary. These data will serve as a resource for replication as more genes become identified with BMI and WC.

TI	A genome-wide association study for blood lipid phenotypes in the Framingham Heart Study.
PG	S17
AB	BACKGROUND: Blood lipid levels including low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides (TG) are highly heritable. Genome-wide association is a promising approach to map genetic loci related to these heritable phenotypes. METHODS: In 1087 Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort participants (mean age 47 years, 52% women), we conducted genome-wide analyses (Affymetrix 100K GeneChip) for fasting blood lipid traits. Total cholesterol, HDL-C, and TG were measured by standard enzymatic methods and LDL-C was calculated using the Friedewald formula. The long-term averages of up to seven measurements of LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG over a approximately 30 year span were the primary phenotypes. We used generalized estimating equations (GEE), family-based association tests (FBAT) and variance components linkage to investigate the relationships between SNPs (on autosomes, with minor allele frequency &gt; or =10%, genotypic call rate &gt; or =80%, and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p &gt; or = 0.001) and multivariable-adjusted residuals. We pursued a three-stage replication strategy of the GEE association results with 287 SNPs (P &lt; 0.001 in Stage I) tested in Stage II (n approximately 1450 individuals) and 40 SNPs (P &lt; 0.001 in joint analysis of Stages I and II) tested in Stage III (n approximately 6650 individuals). RESULTS: Long-term averages of LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG were highly heritable (h2 = 0.66, 0.69, 0.58, respectively; each P &lt; 0.0001). Of 70,987 tests for each of the phenotypes, two SNPs had p &lt; 10(-5) in GEE results for LDL-C, four for HDL-C, and one for TG. For each multivariable-adjusted phenotype, the number of SNPs with association p &lt; 10(-4) ranged from 13 to 18 and with p &lt; 10(-3), from 94 to 149. Some results confirmed previously reported associations with candidate genes including variation in the lipoprotein lipase gene (LPL) and HDL-C and TG (rs7007797; P = 0.0005 for HDL-C and 0.002 for TG). The full set of GEE, FBAT and linkage results are posted at the database of Genotype and Phenotype (dbGaP). After three stages of replication, there was no convincing statistical evidence for association (i.e., combined P &lt; 10(-5) across all three stages) between any of the tested SNPs and lipid phenotypes. CONCLUSION: Using a 100K genome-wide scan, we have generated a set of putative associations for common sequence variants and lipid phenotypes. Validation of selected hypotheses in additional samples did not identify any new loci underlying variability in blood lipids. Lack of replication may be due to inadequate statistical power to detect modest quantitative trait locus effects (i.e., &lt;1% of trait variance explained) or reduced genomic coverage of the 100K array. GWAS in FHS using a denser genome-wide genotyping platform and a better-powered replication strategy may identify novel loci underlying blood lipids.

TI	Genome-wide association with diabetes-related traits in the Framingham Heart Study.
PG	S16
AB	BACKGROUND: Susceptibility to type 2 diabetes may be conferred by genetic variants having modest effects on risk. Genome-wide fixed marker arrays offer a novel approach to detect these variants. METHODS: We used the Affymetrix 100K SNP array in 1,087 Framingham Offspring Study family members to examine genetic associations with three diabetes-related quantitative glucose traits (fasting plasma glucose (FPG), hemoglobin A1c, 28-yr time-averaged FPG (tFPG)), three insulin traits (fasting insulin, HOMA-insulin resistance, and 0-120 min insulin sensitivity index); and with risk for diabetes. We used additive generalized estimating equations (GEE) and family-based association test (FBAT) models to test associations of SNP genotypes with sex-age-age2-adjusted residual trait values, and Cox survival models to test incident diabetes. RESULTS: We found 415 SNPs associated (at p &lt; 0.001) with at least one of the six quantitative traits in GEE, 242 in FBAT (18 overlapped with GEE for 639 non-overlapping SNPs), and 128 associated with incident diabetes (31 overlapped with the 639) giving 736 non-overlapping SNPs. Of these 736 SNPs, 439 were within 60 kb of a known gene. Additionally, 53 SNPs (of which 42 had r2 &lt; 0.80 with each other) had p &lt; 0.01 for incident diabetes AND (all 3 glucose traits OR all 3 insulin traits, OR 2 glucose traits and 2 insulin traits); of these, 36 overlapped with the 736 other SNPs. Of 100K SNPs, one (rs7100927) was in moderate LD (r2 = 0.50) with TCF7L2 (rs7903146), and was associated with risk of diabetes (Cox p-value 0.007, additive hazard ratio for diabetes = 1.56) and with tFPG (GEE p-value 0.03). There were no common (MAF &gt; 1%) 100K SNPs in LD (r2 &gt; 0.05) with ABCC8 A1369S (rs757110), KCNJ11 E23K (rs5219), or SNPs in CAPN10 or HNFa. PPARG P12A (rs1801282) was not significantly associated with diabetes or related traits. CONCLUSION: Framingham 100K SNP data is a resource for association tests of known and novel genes with diabetes and related traits posted at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?id=phs000007 webcite. Framingham 100K data replicate the TCF7L2 association with diabetes.

TI	Genome-wide association with select biomarker traits in the Framingham Heart Study.
PG	S11
AB	BACKGROUND: Systemic biomarkers provide insights into disease pathogenesis, diagnosis, and risk stratification. Many systemic biomarker concentrations are heritable phenotypes. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide mechanisms to investigate the genetic contributions to biomarker variability unconstrained by current knowledge of physiological relations. METHODS: We examined the association of Affymetrix 100K GeneChip single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to 22 systemic biomarker concentrations in 4 biological domains: inflammation/oxidative stress; natriuretic peptides; liver function; and vitamins. Related members of the Framingham Offspring cohort (n = 1012; mean age 59 +/	10 years, 51% women) had both phenotype and genotype data (minimum-maximum per phenotype n = 507-1008). We used Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE), Family Based Association Tests (FBAT) and variance components linkage to relate SNPs to multivariable-adjusted biomarker residuals. Autosomal SNPs (n = 70,987) meeting the following criteria were studied: minor allele frequency &gt; or = 10%, call rate &gt; or = 80% and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p &gt; or = 0.001. RESULTS: With GEE, 58 SNPs had p &lt; 10(-6): the top SNPs were rs2494250 (p = 1.00*10(-14)) and rs4128725 (p = 3.68*10(-12)) for monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1), and rs2794520 (p = 2.83*10(-8)) and rs2808629 (p = 3.19*10(-8)) for C-reactive protein (CRP) averaged from 3 examinations (over about 20 years). With FBAT, 11 SNPs had p &lt; 10(-6): the top SNPs were the same for MCP1 (rs4128725, p = 3.28*10(-8), and rs2494250, p = 3.55*10(-8)), and also included B-type natriuretic peptide (rs437021, p = 1.01*10(-6)) and Vitamin K percent undercarboxylated osteocalcin (rs2052028, p = 1.07*10(-6)). The peak LOD (logarithm of the odds) scores were for MCP1 (4.38, chromosome 1) and CRP (3.28, chromosome 1; previously described) concentrations; of note the 1.5 support interval included the MCP1 and CRP SNPs reported above (GEE model). Previous candidate SNP associations with circulating CRP concentrations were replicated at p &lt; 0.05; the SNPs rs2794520 and rs2808629 are in linkage disequilibrium with previously reported SNPs. GEE, FBAT and linkage results are posted at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?id=phs000007 webcite. CONCLUSION: The Framingham GWAS represents a resource to describe potentially novel genetic influences on systemic biomarker variability. The newly described associations will need to be replicated in other studies.

TI	The candidate genes TAF5L, TCF7, PDCD1, IL6 and ICAM1 cannot be excluded from having effects in type 1 diabetes.
PG	71
AB	BACKGROUND: As genes associated with immune-mediated diseases have an increased prior probability of being associated with other immune-mediated diseases, we tested three such genes, IL23R, IRF5 and CD40, for an association with type 1 diabetes. In addition, we tested seven genes, TAF5L, PDCD1, TCF7, IL12B, IL6, ICAM1 and TBX21, with published marginal or inconsistent evidence of an association with type 1 diabetes. METHODS: We genotyped reported polymorphisms of the ten genes, nonsynonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) and, for the IL12B and IL6 regions, tag SNPs in up to 7,888 case, 8,858 control and 3,142 parent-child trio samples. In addition, we analysed data from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium genome-wide association study to determine whether there was any further evidence of an association in each gene region. RESULTS: We found some evidence of associations between type 1 diabetes and TAF5L, PDCD1, TCF7 and IL6 (ORs = 1.05	1.13; P = 0.0291	4.16 x 10-4). No evidence of an association was obtained for IL12B, IRF5, IL23R, ICAM1, TBX21 and CD40, although there was some evidence of an association (OR = 1.10; P = 0.0257) from the genome-wide association study for the ICAM1 region. CONCLUSION: We failed to exclude the possibility of some effect in type 1 diabetes for TAF5L, PDCD1, TCF7, IL6 and ICAM1. Additional studies, of these and other candidate genes, employing much larger sample sizes and analysis of additional polymorphisms in each gene and its flanking region will be required to ascertain their contributions to type 1 diabetes susceptibility.

TI	TCF7L2 rs7903146 variant does not associate with smallness for gestational age in the French population.
PG	37
AB	BACKGROUND: In adults, the TCF7L2 rs7903146 T allele, commonly associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D), has been also associated with a lower body mass index (BMI) in T2D individuals and with a smaller waist circumference in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance. METHODS: The present association study aimed at analyzing the contribution of the rs7903146 SNP to smallness for gestational age (SGA) and metabolic profiles in subjects with SGA or appropriate for gestational age birth weight (AGA). Two groups of French Caucasian subjects were selected on birth data: SGA (birth weight &lt; 10th percentile; n = 764), and AGA (25th &lt; birth weight &lt; 75th percentile; n = 627). Family-based association tests were also performed in 3,012 subjects from 628 SGA and AGA pedigrees. RESULTS: The rs7903146 genotypic distributions between AGA (30.7%) and SGA (29.0%) were not statistically different (allelic OR = 0.92 [0.78-1.09], p = 0.34). Family association-based studies did not show a distortion of T allele transmission in SGA subjects (p = 0.52). No significant effect of the T allele was detected on any of the metabolic parameters in the SGA group. However, in the AGA group, trends towards a lower insulin secretion (p = 0.03) and a higher fasting glycaemia (p = 0.002) were detected in carriers of the T allele. CONCLUSION: The TCF7L2 rs7903146 variant neither increases the risk for SGA nor modulates birth weight and young adulthood glucose homeostasis in French Caucasian subjects born with SGA.

TI	Effect of the 3'APOB-VNTR polymorphism on the lipid profiles in the Guangxi Hei Yi Zhuang and Han populations.
PG	45
AB	BACKGROUND: Apolipoprotein (Apo) B is the major component of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicrons. Many genetic polymorphisms of the Apo B have been described, associated with variation of lipid levels. However, very few studies have evaluated the effect of the variable number of tandem repeats region 3' of the Apo B gene (3'APOB-VNTR) polymorphism on the lipid profiles in the special minority subgroups in China. Thus, the present study was undertaken to study the effect of the 3'APOB-VNTR polymorphism on the serum lipid levels in the Guangxi Hei Yi Zhuang and Han populations. METHODS: A total of 548 people of Hei Yi Zhuang were surveyed by a stratified randomized cluster sampling. The epidemiological survey was performed using internationally standardized methods. Serum lipid and apolipoprotein levels were measured. The 3'APOB-VNTR alleles were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels, and classified according to the number of repeats of a 15-bp hypervariable elements (HVE). The sequence of the most common allele was determined using the PCR and direct sequencing. The possible association between alleles of the 3'APOB-VNTR and lipid variables was examined. The results were compared with those in 496 people of Han who also live in that district. RESULTS: Nineteen alleles ranging from 24 to 64 repeats were detected in both Hei Yi Zhuang and Han. HVE56 and HVE58 were not be detected in Hei Yi Zhuang whereas HVE48 and HVE62 were totally absent in Han. The frequencies of HVE26, HVE30, HVE46, heterozygote, and short alleles (&lt; 38 repeats) were higher in Hei Yi Zhuang than in Han. But the frequencies of HVE34, HVE38, HVE40, homozygote, and long alleles (&gt; or = 38 repeats) were lower in Hei Yi Zhuang than in Han (P &lt; 0.05-0.01). The levels of total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and Apo B in Hei Yi Zhuang but not in Han were higher in VNTR-LS (carrier of one long and one short alleles) than in VNTR-LL (the individual carrying two long alleles) genotypes. The levels of TC, triglycerides (TG), LDL cholesterol, and Apo B in Hei Yi Zhuang were higher in both HVE34 and HVE36 alleles than in HVE32 allele. The levels of TC, TG, HDL-C and Apo B in Hei Yi Zhuang were also higher in homozygotes than in heterozygotes. There were no significant differences in the detected lipid parameters between the VNTR-SS (carrier of two short alleles) and VNTR-LS or VNTR-LL genotypes in both ethnic groups. CONCLUSION: There were significant differences of the 3'APOB-VNTR polymorphism between the Hei Yi Zhuang and Han populations. An association between the 3'APOB-VNTR polymorphism and serum lipid levels was observed in the Hei Yi Zhuang but not in the Han populations.

TI	Resequencing of genes for transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFB1) type 1 and 2 receptors (TGFBR1, TGFBR2), and association analysis of variants with diabetic nephropathy.
PG	5
AB	BACKGROUND: Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of end stage renal failure in the western world. There is substantial epidemiological evidence supporting a genetic predisposition to diabetic nephropathy, however the exact molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Transforming growth factor (TGFbeta1) is a crucial mediator in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. METHODS: We investigated the role of five known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TGFB1 gene for their association with diabetic nephropathy in an Irish, type 1 diabetic case (n = 272) control (n = 367) collection. The activity of TGFbeta1 is facilitated by the action of type 1 and type 2 receptors, with both receptor genes (TGFBR1 and TGFBR2) shown to be upregulated in diabetic kidney disease. We therefore screened TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 genes for genomic variants using WAVEtrade mark (dHPLC) technology and confirmed variants by direct capillary sequencing. Allele frequencies were determined in forty-eight healthy individuals. Data for all SNPs was assessed for Hardy Weinberg equilibrium, with genotypes and allele frequencies compared using the chi2 test for contingency tables. Patterns of linkage disequilibrium were established and common haplotypes estimated. RESULTS: Fifteen variants were identified in these genes, seven of which are novel, and putatively functional SNPs were subsequently genotyped using TaqMantrade mark, Invadertrade mark or Pyrosequencing(R) technology. No significant differences (p &gt; 0.1) were found in genotype or allele distributions between cases and controls for any of the SNPs assessed. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest common variants in TGFB1, TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 genes do not strongly influence genetic susceptibility to diabetic nephropathy in an Irish Caucasian population.

TI	Abnormal glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in polycystic ovary syndrome amongst the Taiwanese population	not correlated with insulin receptor substrate-1 Gly972Arg/Ala513Pro polymorphism.
PG	36
AB	BACKGROUND: Insulin resistance and glucose dysmetabolism in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are related with the polymorphisms in the genes encoding the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins, especially Gly972Arg/Ala513Pro polymorphism being reported to be associated with type-2 diabetes and PCOS. We intended to assess the prevalence of abnormal glucose tolerance (AGT) and insulin resistance in Taiwanese PCOS women. We also tried to assess whether the particular identity of Gly972Arg/Ala513Pro polymorphic alleles of the IRS-1 gene mutation can be used as an appropriate diagnostic indicator for PCOS. METHODS: We designed a prospective clinical study. Forty-seven Taiwanese Hoklo and Hakka women, diagnosed with PCOS were enrolled in this study as were forty-five healthy Hoklo and Hakka women as the control group. Insulin resistance was evaluated with fasting insulin, fasting glucose/insulin ratio, and homeostasis model assessment index for insulin resistance (HOMAIR). The genomic DNA of the subjects was amplified by PCR and digested by restriction fragmented length polymorphism (RFLP) with Bst N1 used for codon 972 and Dra III for codon 513. RESULTS: AGT was found in 46.8% of these PCOS patients and was significantly related to high insulin resistance rather than the low insulin resistance. Those patients with either insulin resistance or AGT comprised the majority of PCOS affected patients (AGT + fasting insulin &gt; or =17: 83%, AGT + glucose/insulin ratio &gt; or =6.5: 85.1%, AGT + HOMAIR &gt; or = 2: 87.2%, and AGT + HOMAIR &gt; or = 3.8: 72.3%). None of the tested samples revealed any polymorphism due to the absence of any Dra III recognition site or any Bst N1 recognition site in the amplified PCR fragment digested by restriction fragmented length polymorphism. CONCLUSION: There is significantly high prevalence of AGT and insulin resistance in PCOS women, but Gly972Arg and Ala513Pro polymorphic alleles of IRS-1 are rare and are not associated with the elevated risk of PCOS amongst Taiwanese subjects. This is quite different from the similar study in phylogenetically diverged Caucasian subjects.

TI	Implication of the Pro12Ala polymorphism of the PPAR-gamma 2 gene in type 2 diabetes and obesity in the French population.
PG	11
AB	BACKGROUND: The Pro12Ala Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) of the Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma 2 (PPAR-gamma 2) has been associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D) and also inconsistently with obesity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of this SNP with regards to T2D and childhood and adult obesity in the French Caucasian population. METHODS: We conducted three independent case/control studies encompassing 2126 cases and 1124 controls. RESULTS: We found a significant association between PPAR-gamma 2 Pro12Ala SNP and T2D (p = 0.04, OR = 1.37), which was stronger when the T2D cohort was stratified according to the obesity status (p = 0.03, OR = 1.81 in obese T2D subjects). In contrast, there was no association between the Pro12Ala SNP and childhood and adulthood obesity. In normal glucose tolerant obese adults (but not in lean subjects), the Pro12 allele was associated with a significant increase in fasting insulin levels (p = 0.01), and in insulin resistance estimated by the Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) (p = 0.003), after adjustment for age, gender and BMI. We didn't detect evidence for an interaction effect between the Pro12Ala SNP and the obesity status with respect to the HOMA-IR index in normal glucose tolerant children, but we found a borderline interaction (p = 0.06) in normal glucose tolerant adults. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that the Pro12Ala polymorphism is not associated with childhood or adult obesity in the French Caucasian population. In contrast, we confirm a contribution of the PPAR-gamma 2 Pro12 allele in the genetic risk forT2D, especially in obese subjects, where this allele worsens insulin resistanceand increases fasting insulin levels.

TI	Genetic risk factors for cerebrovascular disease in children with sickle cell disease: design of a case-control association study and genomewide screen.
PG	6
AB	BACKGROUND: The phenotypic heterogeneity of sickle cell disease is likely the result of multiple genetic factors and their interaction with the sickle mutation. High transcranial doppler (TCD) velocities define a subgroup of children with sickle cell disease who are at increased risk for developing ischemic stroke. The genetic factors leading to the development of a high TCD velocity (i.e. cerebrovascular disease) and ultimately to stroke are not well characterized. METHODS: We have designed a case-control association study to elucidate the role of genetic polymorphisms as risk factors for cerebrovascular disease as measured by a high TCD velocity in children with sickle cell disease. The study will consist of two parts: a candidate gene study and a genomewide screen and will be performed in 230 cases and 400 controls. Cases will include 130 patients (TCD &gt; or = 200 cm/s) randomized in the Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Anemia (STOP) study as well as 100 other patients found to have high TCD in STOP II screening. Four hundred sickle cell disease patients with a normal TCD velocity (TCD &lt; 170 cm/s) will be controls. The candidate gene study will involve the analysis of 28 genetic polymorphisms in 20 candidate genes. The polymorphisms include mutations in coagulation factor genes (Factor V, Prothrombin, Fibrinogen, Factor VII, Factor XIII, PAI-1), platelet activation/function (GpIIb/IIIa, GpIb IX-V, GpIa/IIa), vascular reactivity (ACE), endothelial cell function (MTHFR, thrombomodulin, VCAM-1, E-Selectin, L-Selectin, P-Selectin, ICAM-1), inflammation (TNFalpha), lipid metabolism (Apo A1, Apo E), and cell adhesion (VCAM-1, E-Selectin, L-Selectin, P-Selectin, ICAM-1). We will perform a genomewide screen of validated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in pooled DNA samples from 230 cases and 400 controls to study the possible association of additional polymorphisms with the high-risk phenotype. High-throughput SNP genotyping will be performed through MALDI-TOF technology using Sequenom's MassARRAY system. DISCUSSION: It is expected that this study will yield important information on genetic risk factors for the cerebrovascular disease phenotype in sickle cell disease by clarifying the role of candidate genes in the development of high TCD. The genomewide screen for a large number of SNPs may uncover the association of novel polymorphisms with cerebrovascular disease and stroke in sickle cell disease.

AB	Association of apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele with peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) bone traits at the distal and shaft sites of the radius and tibia was evaluated in the Young Finns Cohort (n=1777). We also analyzed the interactions of the APOE promoter polymorphisms (-219G/T rs405509 and +113G/C rs440446) and bone traits within the APOE epsilon3/epsilon3 genotype (n=1025 and n=1013, respectively), and investigated the gene-environment interactions on bone traits with longitudinal saturated fatty acids (SAFA) intake. Differences between the epsilon4 allele carriers and noncarriers were modest and mostly nonsignificant. Within the APOE promoter -219G/T polymorphism, cortical strength index (CSI) and compressive bone strength index (BSI) at the distal radius (linear, P=0.003 and P=0.05, respectively) and tibia (linear, P=0.01 and P=0.03, respectively), and CSI at the tibial shaft (linear, P=0.04) decreased towards the -219T/T genotype in women. In men, total cross-sectional areas at the radial site and stress-strain index (SSI) at the radial shaft (linear, P=0.03 and P=0.04 and P=0.05, respectively) increased, and conversely cortical bone density and CSI at the radial shaft (linear, P=0.005 and P=0.05, respectively) and CSI at the tibial shaft (linear, P=0.03) decreased towards the -219T/T genotype. In the highest SAFA tertile, women with the -219T/T genotype had the smallest total area and SSI at the radial shaft (P=0.01 and P=0.02, respectively). Subjects with the APOE +113C/C genotype shared similar bone traits as subjects with the APOE -219T/T genotype. In conclusion, APOE genotypes -219T/T and +113C/C could be genetic markers for cortical bone strength. Furthermore, high longitudinal SAFA intake seems to be more detrimental to bone in women with the -219T/T and +133C/C genotypes than others.

TI	Angiotensin converting enzyme gene deletion allele is independently and strongly associated with coronary atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction.
PG	584-91
AB	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of the three angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) genotypes, DD, ID, and II, with the occurrence or absence of coronary atherosclerosis and with myocardial infarction and hypertension. DESIGN: Cohort analysis study. SETTING: North-Italy reference centre. SUBJECTS: 388 white Italian patients (281 males; mean age 60.7 (SD 12.5) years) with proven coronary atherosclerosis (n = 255) or with angiographically normal coronary arteries (n = 133). A further group of 290 healthy blood donors was tested for allele frequency comparison. INTERVENTIONS: ACE/ID polymorphism was analysed with polymerase chain reaction on DNA from white blood cells. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Coronary atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, hypertension. RESULTS: The D and I allele frequencies were respectively 0.63 and 0.37 in the overall healthy blood donor group and 0.66 and 0.34 in the overall study group. In the latter, univariate analysis showed (1) that coronary atherosclerosis (255 patients) was associated with the deletion allele, with an odds ratio (OR) of 5.78 for DD/II, P &lt; 0.001, and 2.39 for ID/II, P = 0.006; and (2) that myocardial infarction (154 patients) was associated with the DD genotype (OR DD/II = 2.56, P = 0.007), but not with the ID genotype (OR DD/II = 1.96, P = 0.056). Finally, hypertension proved to be unrelated with the ACE genotype. The distribution between the three genotypes of known risk factors for coronary artery disease was similar. Logistic regression modelling, performed to test the association of the selected risk factors simultaneously with coronary atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction, showed that the deletion allele (whether DD or ID) was the strongest risk factor for atherosclerosis, and that the D allele was significantly associated with the risk of infarction (although to a lesser extent than with coronary atherosclerosis). CONCLUSION: ACE deletion polymorphism is strongly and independently associated with coronary atherosclerosis and, to a lesser extent, with myocardial infarction. As such, the results are analogous to what has already been reported in French white, Japanese, and Welsh coronary patients.

TI	Apolipoprotein E gene polymorphisms are associated with psoriasis but do not determine disease response to acitretin.
PG	345-52
AB	BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is associated with abnormal plasma lipid metabolism and a high frequency of cardiovascular events. Increased lipid levels are also seen in patients with psoriasis treated with acitretin. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) variants have been linked to hypertriglyceridaemia and hypercholesterolaemia in normal individuals. Two coding single nucleotide polymorphisms at +3937 and +4075 define the three common ApoE alleles e2, e3 and e4. OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that particular ApoE polymorphism(s) are associated with psoriasis and that specific ApoE allelic variant(s) may be a marker for predicting disease response to acitretin. METHODS: DNA was genotyped for ApoE polymorphisms using a radioactive hybridization technique in cohorts of patients with psoriasis, including patients with chronic plaque psoriasis (CPP, n = 212), guttate psoriasis (GP, n = 94), palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP, n = 101), controls (n = 137), acitretin responders (n =106) and acitretin nonresponders (n = 84). RESULTS: The frequency of the e4 allele (+3937C/+4075C) was significantly higher in patients with CPP and GP than in controls (P = 0.008 and P = 0.02, respectively). There was no significant difference in allele frequencies between patients with PPP and controls. Allelic distribution was similar in acitretin responders and nonresponders. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate an association between the Apo e4 allele and CPP and GP, suggesting a possible pathogenic role for ApoE in psoriasis. Our results do not support a link between disease response to acitretin and the e2, e3 or e4 allelic variants of ApoE.

TI	Haplotypes in the tumour necrosis factor region and myeloma.
PG	358-65
AB	This study described the haplotypic structure across a region of chromosome 6 including the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) gene, and investigated its influence on the aetiology of myeloma. A total of 181 myeloma cases from the Medical Research Council Myeloma VII trial and 233 controls from the Leukaemia Research Fund Case Control Study of Adult Acute Leukaemia were included in the analysis. Genotyping by induced heteroduplex generator analysis was carried out for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) located at positions -1031, -863, -857, -308 and -238 of the 5' promoter region of TNF-alpha gene, and 252 in the LT-alpha gene; and five microsatellites, TNFa, b, c, d and e. Haplotypes were inferred statistically using the phase algorithm. A limited diversity of haplotypes was observed, with the majority of variation described by 12 frequent haplotypes. Detailed characterization of the haplotype did not provide greater determination of disease risk beyond that described by the TNF-alpha-308 SNP. Some evidence was provided for a decreased risk of myeloma associated with the TNF-alpha-308 variant allele A, odds ratio, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.38-0.86. The results of this study did not support our starting hypothesis; that high producer haplotypes at the TNF locus are associated with an increased risk of developing myeloma.

TI	Prevalence of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T and its association with arterial and venous thrombosis in the Chinese population.
PG	870-4
AB	Moderate hyperhomocysteinaemia (MHH) is associated with arterial and venous thrombosis. A main genetic defect related to MHH is a C to T substitution at nucleotide 677 of the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene. A prothrombin 20210A mutation was recently identified as a risk factor for arterial and venous thrombosis. However, studies on the prevalence of mutant MTHFR C677T and prothrombin G20210A and their association with thrombosis were controversial and seldom reported in the Chinese population. We investigated the prevalence of MTHFR C677T and prothrombin G20210A genotypes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by restriction enzyme digestion in 420 Chinese subjects: 53 with deep venous thrombosis (DVT); 145 with cerebrovascular disease [115 cerebral infarction, 30 cerebral haemorrhage (CH)]; 100 with coronary artery disease (CAD); and 122 control subjects. The prevalence of the mutated MTHFR 677TT genotype and the 677T allele in normal controls was 12.3% and 30.7% respectively, similar to that in Caucasians and Japanese. The mutant 677T homozygotes and alleles were more frequent in patients with DVT than in controls (18.9% vs. 12.3%, 0.01 &lt; P &lt; 0. 025; 48.1% vs. 30.7%, P &lt; 0.005). The relative risk of DVT among the carriers of 677TT and 677T were significantly increased [odds ratios: 3.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-9.5, and 3.6, 95% CI 1. 7-7.7, respectively). The mutant MTHFR heterozygous 677C/T carriers were increased in patients with cerebral infarction compared with controls (53.9% vs. 36.9%, 0.01 &lt; P &lt; 0.025). Relative risk of cerebral infarction was 0.96 (95% CI 0.4-2.3) for 677TT homozygotes and 1.99 (95% CI 1.2-3.4) for 677C/T heterozygotes. However, the distribution of the MTHFR TT genotype was less frequent in patients with CAD with coronary artery stenosis of &gt; 50% than in controls (2. 8% vs. 12.3%, 0.025 &lt; P &lt; 0.05). Relative risk of CAD was not increased among the carriers of 677TT and 677T (odds ratios: 0.2, 95% CI 0-1.1, and 0.97, 95% CI 0.5-1.8, respectively). There were no differences in the distribution of the MTHFR genotypes among CH, CAD with coronary artery stenosis of &lt; 50% and controls. The prothrombin 20210A mutation was not found in any patients or controls. These results demonstrated that MTHFR 677T was associated with DVT and cerebral infarction but was less associated with CAD in the Chinese population.

TI	Effects of epigallocatechin gallate on regulatory T cell number and function in obese v. lean volunteers.
PG	1771-7
AB	Obesity predisposes to an increased incidence of diabetes and CVD. Also, obesity is a pro-inflammatory state. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are essential negative regulators of inflammation and are down-regulated in pro-inflammatory states. Animal models of obesity are associated with decreased Tregs. The dietary modulation of Tregs could be used as a therapeutic strategy to control inflammation. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is a potent anti-inflammatory agent and an active ingredient of green tea and is suggested to have a role as a preventive agent in obesity, diabetes and CVD. The role of EGCG in the modulation of Tregs has, however, not been studied. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine the effect of EGCG on the number and function of Tregs in obese and lean human subjects in vitro, and to delineate its specific regulation mechanisms. Tregs were isolated from normal-weight and obese subjects. Tregs were cultured in the absence or presence of EGCG (20 mum) for 24 h. Foxp3-expressing Tregs were enumerated using flow cytometry. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity and nuclear NF-kappaBp65 level were measured by ELISA and Western blots. Obese subjects had lower Tregs and IL-10 production than lean subjects. EGCG treatment significantly enhanced the number of Foxp3-expressing Tregs and IL-10 production in vitro (P &lt; 0.05) in both groups. Also, EGCG decreased NF-kappaB activity and increased HDAC activity and HDAC-2 expression in Tregs (P &lt; 0.05) in both groups. Thus, in part, EGCG enhances the functionality of Tregs, i.e. IL-10 production and number by suppressing the NF-kappaB signalling pathway via inducing epigenetic changes.

TI	Metabolic imprinting, programming and epigenetics	a review of present priorities and future opportunities.
PG	S1-25
AB	Metabolic programming and metabolic imprinting describe early life events, which impact upon on later physiological outcomes. Despite the increasing numbers of papers and studies, the distinction between metabolic programming and metabolic imprinting remains confusing. The former can be defined as a dynamic process whose effects are dependent upon a critical window(s) while the latter can be more strictly associated with imprinting at the genomic level. The clinical end points associated with these phenomena can sometimes be mechanistically explicable in terms of gene expression mediated by epigenetics. The predictivity of outcomes depends on determining if there is causality or association in the context of both early dietary exposure and future health parameters. The use of biomarkers is a key aspect of determining the predictability of later outcome, and the strengths of particular types of biomarkers need to be determined. It has become clear that several important health endpoints are impacted upon by metabolic programming/imprinting. These include the link between perinatal nutrition, nutritional epigenetics and programming at an early developmental stage and its link to a range of future health risks such as CVD and diabetes. In some cases, the evidence base remains patchy and associative, while in others, a more direct causality between early nutrition and later health is clear. In addition, it is also essential to acknowledge the communication to consumers, industry, health care providers, policy-making bodies as well as to the scientific community. In this way, both programming and, eventually, reprogramming can become effective tools to improve health through dietary intervention at specific developmental points.

TI	Genotype x nutrient association of common polymorphisms in obesity-related genes with food preferences and time structure of energy intake.
PG	352-9
AB	Personal food preferences can either enhance or suppress the development of obesity and the selection and proportion of macronutrients in the diet seem to have a heritable component. In the present study, we therefore focused on dietary composition as a specific trait related to obesity and we determined whether genetic variations in leptin (LEP), LEP receptor (LEPR), adiponectin (ADIPOQ), IL-6 and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) underlie specific native food preferences and obesity-related anthropometric parameters. The total of 409 individuals of Czech Caucasian origin were enrolled into the present study and 7 d food records were obtained from the study subjects along with selected anthropometric measurements. In a subset of study subjects, plasma levels of ADIPOQ, LEP and soluble LEPR were measured. Independently of the BMI of the individuals, common variations in LEP and LEPR genes were associated with specific eating patterns, mainly with respect to timing of eating. The LEP + 19A/G polymorphism served as an independent predictor for BMI, percentage of body fat and skinfold thickness and significantly affected the time structure of the daily energy intake. The POMC RsaI polymorphism was associated with percentage of body fat. The ADIPOQ 45 T/G polymorphism was associated with the thickness of the subscapular skinfold. The LEPR Gln223Arg polymorphism was associated with multiple parameters, including diastolic blood pressure, meal sizes during the day and plasma ADIPOQ levels. In a separate analysis, soluble leptin receptor (sObR) plasma levels and LEP:sObR ratio were significantly correlated with systolic blood pressure (beta =	0.66, P = 0.002; beta =	1.23, P = 0.02) and sObR plasma levels also served as an independent predictor for diastolic blood pressure (beta =	0.50; P = 0.04). To conclude, we report common allelic variants associated with specific feeding behaviour and obesity-related anthropometric traits. Moreover, we identified allelic variants that significantly influence the time structure of food intake during the day.

TI	Endothelial dysfunction and compromised eNOS/Akt signaling in the thoracic aorta during the progression of Marfan syndrome.
PG	1075-83
AB	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Aortic complications account for the major mortality in Marfan syndrome (MFS), a connective tissue disorder caused by mutations in FBN1 encoding fibrillin-1. We hypothesized that MFS impaired endothelial function and nitric oxide (NO) production in the aorta. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Mice (at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of age) heterozygous for the Fbn1 allele encoding a cysteine substitution (Fbn1 (C1039G/+), Marfan mice, n=75), the most common class of mutation in MFS, were compared with age-matched control littermates (n=75). Thoracic and abdominal aortas from the two groups were studied. KEY RESULTS: Isometric force measurements revealed that relaxation to ACh (but not to sodium nitroprusside) was diminished in the phenylephrine-precontracted Marfan thoracic aorta at 6 months of age (pEC(50)=6.12+/-0.22; maximal response, E(max)=52.7+/-6.8%; control: pEC(50)=7.34+/-0.19; E(max)=84.8+/-2.2%). At one year, both inhibition of NO production with N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, or denudation of endothelium increased the phenylephrine-stimulated contraction in the control thoracic aorta by 35%, but had no effect in the Marfan aorta, indicating a loss of basal NO production in the Marfan vessel. From 6 months, a reduced phosphorylation of endothelial NOS (eNOS)(Ser1177) and Akt(Thr308) detected by Western blotting was observed in the Marfan thoracic aorta, which was accompanied by decreased levels of cGMP. Expressions of Akt and eNOS in the abdominal aorta were not different between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: MFS impairs endothelial function and signaling of NO production in the thoracic aorta, suggesting the importance of NO in the age-related progression of thoracic aortic manifestations.

TI	Effect of Turner's syndrome and X-linked imprinting on cognitive status: analysis based on pedigree data.
PG	494-503
AB	The effects of a monosomy of either the maternally or paternally derived X chromosome in Turner's syndrome (TS) on general neurocognitive status and some executive abilities were assessed using the maximum likelihood estimators for pedigree data. This method increases the power of analysis by accounting for the effect of background heritable variation on a trait. The sample comprised 42 females with regular non-mosaic X monosomy and their non-affected relatives. Wechsler neurocognitive scores and several executive function tests' scores, including the Behaviour Dyscontrol Scale (BDS-2), the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), and the Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT), were considered in the analysis. Results showed a significant effect of TS on all Wechsler index and subtest scores, with greatest deficits observed in Arithmetic, Block Design, Object Assembly and Picture Arrangement, and on the total BDS, RCFT and WCST scores, regardless of parental origin of the single X-chromosome. Our data also showed a significantly higher effect of a paternally derived X chromosome in diminishing the performance on several Wechsler scores relevant to verbal skills, which might suggest X-linked imprinting loci relevant to these skills. Possible reasons for the inconsistency of the results concerning X-linked imprinting of cognitive loci using TS patients are discussed, and the relevance of pedigree analysis to future studies of this problem is emphasized.

TI	Cytogenetic and molecular-cytogenetic studies of Rett syndrome (RTT): a retrospective analysis of a Russian cohort of RTT patients (the investigation of 57 girls and three boys).
PG	S196-201
AB	Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder with an incidence of 2.5% in mentally retarded girls in Russia. We have performed cytogenetic studies of 60 patients (57 girls and three boys) with a clinical picture of RTT, selected according to the criteria for diagnosis of RTT defined by B. Hagberg et al. in 1996. Collection of DNA samples and fixed cell suspensions of RTT patients (37 girls and two boys) and their parents (27 patients) was established for molecular studies, for example analysis of MECP2 mutations in a Russian cohort of RTT patients. Among 60 patients 57 girls with a clinical picture of RTT had normal female karyotype (46,XX), one boy had normal male karyotype in peripheral lymphocytes (46,XY) and two boys had a mosaic form of Kleinfelter's syndrome (47,XXY/46,XY) in peripheral lymphocytes or muscle cells (with MeCP2 mutation R270X). Twenty-four mothers and parents of RTT girls had normal karyotype, two mothers had mosaic forms of Turner syndrome (45,X/46,XX) and one had mosaic karyotype (47,XX,+mar/48,XXX,+mar). We analyzed chromosome X in lymphocytes of 57 affected girls with a clinical picture of RTT using the 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine+Giemsa staining technique. A specific type of inactive chromosome X (so-called type 'C') with unusual staining of chromatin in the long arm of chromosome X was found in 55 (from 57) girls with RTT. This technique was positively used for presymptomatic diagnosis of RTT in five girls in earlier stages of the disease. We believe that the phenomenon of altered chromatin conformation in inactive chromosome X could be used as a laboratory test for preclinical diagnosis of the RTT.

TI	Lack of evidence for monosomy 1p36 in patients with Prader-Willi-like phenotype.
PG	681-3
LID	S0100-879X2008000800007 [pii]
AB	Monosomy 1p36 is the most common subtelomeric microdeletion syndrome with an incidence rate estimated to be 1 in 5000 births. A hypothesis of a similarity between patients with 1p36 deletion and those with Prader-Willi syndrome and the existence of two different phenotypes for 1p36 microdeletion has been suggested. The main objective of the present study was to determine the existence of 1p36 microdeletion in a sample of patients with mental retardation, obesity and hyperphagia who tested negative by the methylation test for Prader-Willi syndrome. Sixteen patients (7 females, 9 males), 16-26 years old, were evaluated with high-resolution cytogenetic analysis at 550-850 band levels and with 11 polymorphic microsatellite markers located in the 1p36 region. All patients had normal cytogenetic and molecular results. The results obtained by high-resolution cytogenetic methodology were confirmed by the molecular analyses. We did not detect a 1p36 microdeletion in 16 subjects with the Prader-Willi-like phenotype, which reinforces that no correlation seems to exist between Prader-Willi-like phenotype and the 1p36 microdeletion syndrome.

TI	C677T polymorphism of the MTHFR gene and variant hemoglobins: a study in newborns from Salvador, Bahia, Brazil.
PG	529-33
AB	The C677T polymorphism in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR) is associated with an increase in total homocysteine serum levels (tHcy), described as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Eight hundred forty-three neonates from two different maternity hospitals, one public and another private, in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil were screened for this polymorphism by PCR and RFLP. The T-allele frequency in the total sample was 0.23, and the prevalence rates of heterozygous and homozygous carriers were 36.2% and 5.3%, respectively. The T-allele frequency differed and the T/T genotype was more prevalent at the private maternity hospital. The hemoglobin (Hb) profile was investigated by HPLC in 763 newborns. The frequency of variant Hb was higher at the public than at the private maternity hospital. The association of the C677T polymorphism and the Hb profile was investigated in 683 newborns, showing a relatively high frequency of variant Hbs and the T allele. These data could provide an important basis for further studies focusing on potential risks of vaso-occlusive events in these individuals.

TI	Impact of maternal undernutrition on diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk in adult offspring.
PG	161-79
AB	Epidemiological, clinical, and experimental observations have led to the hypothesis that the risk of developing chronic diseases in adulthood is influenced not only by genetic and adult lifestyle factors, but also by environmental factors during early life. Low birth weight, a marker of intrauterine stress, has been linked to predisposition to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes. The compelling animal evidence and significant human data to support this conclusion are reviewed. Specifically, the review discusses the role of maternal nutrition before and during pregnancy, placental insufficiencies and epigenetic changes in the increased predisposition to diabetes and CVD in adult life. The impact of low birth weight and catch-up growth as they pertain to risk of disease in adult life is also discussed. In addition, adult disease risk in the overnourished fetus is also mentioned. Reference is made to some of the mechanisms of the induction of diabetes and CVD phenotype. It is proposed that fetal nutrition, growth and development through efficient maternal nutrition before and during pregnancy could constitute the basis for nutritional strategies for the primary prevention of diabetes and CVD.

TI	Evidence for hypomethylation in two children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and leukoencephalopathy.
PG	925-31
AB	BACKGROUND: The prognosis of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in childhood has improved with intensive chemotherapy. In particular, central nervous system (CNS) leukemia has been well controlled by the presymptomatic administration of intrathecal methotrexate (MTX), high dose systemic MTX, and irradiation. However, the prolonged intrathecal administration and/or the administration of high doses of systemic MTX, especially when combined with irradiation, can lead to leukoencephalopathy (LE), a serious CNS complication of such prophylaxis. Because the mechanisms by which MTX causes this complication have not been elucidated, the authors investigated the transmethylation status of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in two children with ALL and LE to investigate the pathophysiology of that disorder. METHODS: The levels of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) were measured in the CSF of 2 children with ALL and LE, 7 children with ALL only who were undergoing presymptomatic administration of MTX, and 18 reference children in whom diagnostic lumbar puncture was indicated for other reasons. A sensitive, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was used with fluorescence detection. RESULTS: The concentrations of SAM in the CSF were lower in the patients with ALL during treatment with MTX compared with the reference children. The SAM levels in the 2 patients with both ALL and LE were slightly lower than the levels in the 7 patients with ALL only. The SAH concentrations in the CSF were higher in the patients with ALL and LE compared with the patients with ALL only and the reference children. The mean concentration of SAH in the CSF was similar in the reference children to that found in the 7 patients with ALL only. The SAM-to-SAH ratios were lower in the 2 patients with ALL and LE and in the 7 patients with ALL only compared with the reference children. The ratios in the patients with ALL and LE were still lower than in those with ALL only, thus providing supporting evidence of hypomethylation in the 2 patients with ALL and LE. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that the treatment of children with ALL using MTX causes subclinical hypomethylation and that progressive hypomethylation in the CNS, as evidenced in the 2 patients with ALL and LE, may be responsible for the demyelination in the LE induced by MTX.

TI	Epigenetic dysregulation of secreted Frizzled-related proteins in multiple myeloma.
PG	24-31
AB	We analysed the clinical impact of epigenetic dysregulation of the Wnt pathway in malignant plasma cell disorders. In multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines, aberrant promoter hypermethylation of the secreted Frizzled-related protein (SFRP) genes was a common event, and hypermethylation of SFRP1,-2 and -5 was associated with transcriptional silencing. Among 76 primary patient samples, the frequency of aberrant methylation was 35.5% for SFRP1, 52.6% for SFRP2, 1.3% for SFRP4 and 6.9% for SFRP5. Hypermethylation of SFRP1 and -2 genes was detected in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and all MM stages including plasma cell leukaemia (PCL), while SFRP5 methylation was restricted to advanced MM stages and PCL. Our data indicate that epigenetic silencing of Wnt antagonists is an early event in MM pathogenesis and that SFRP5 hypermethylation may play a role in disease progression.

TI	Identification of cyclin D1 and other novel targets for the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene by expression array analysis and investigation of cyclin D1 genotype as a modifier in von Hippel-Lindau disease.
PG	3803-11
AB	Germ-line mutations in the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor disease are associated with a high risk of retinal and cerebellar hemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and, in some cases, pheochromocytoma (PHE). In addition, somatic mutation or epigenetic inactivation of the VHL gene occurs in most clear cell RCCs. VHL protein (pVHL) has a critical role in regulating proteasomal degradation of the HIF transcription factor, and VHL inactivation results in overexpression of many hypoxia-inducible mRNAs including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). To identify novel pVHL target genes we investigated the effect of wild-type (WT) pVHL on the expression of 588 cancer-related genes in two VHL-defective RCC cell lines. Expression array analysis identified nine genes that demonstrated a &gt;2-fold decrease in expression in both RCC cell lines after restoration of WT pVHL. Three of the nine genes (VEGF, PAI-1, and LRP1) had been reported previously as pVHL targets and are known to be hypoxia-inducible. In addition, six novel targets were detected: cyclin D1 (CCND1), cell division protein kinase 6, collagen VIII alpha 1 subunit, CD59 glycoprotein precursor, integrin beta8, and interleukin 6 precursor IFN-beta2. We found no evidence that CCND1, cell division protein kinase 6, CD59, and integrin beta8 expression was influenced by hypoxia suggesting that pVHL down-regulates these targets by a HIF-independent mechanism. A type 2C pVHL mutant (V188L), which is associated with a PHE only phenotype (and had been shown previously to retain the ability to promote HIF ubiquitylation), retained the ability to suppress CCND1expression suggesting that loss of pVHL-mediated suppression of cyclin D1 is not necessary for PHE development in VHL disease. Other studies have suggested that: (a) genetic modifiers influence the phenotypic expression of VHL disease; and (b) polymorphic variation at a CCND1 codon 242 A/G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) may influence cancer susceptibility or prognosis in some situations. Therefore, we analyzed the relationship between CCND1 genotype and phenotypic expression of VHL disease. There was an association between the G allele and multiple retinal angiomas (P = 0.04), and risk of central nervous system hemangioblastomas (P = 0.05). These findings suggest that a variety of HIF-independent mechanisms may contribute to pVHL tumor suppressor activity and that polymorphic variation at one pVHL target influences the phenotypic expression of VHL disease.

TI	Analysis of prothrombotic mutations and polymorphisms in children who developed thrombosis in the perioperative period of congenital cardiac surgery.
PG	19-25
AB	In this study, we investigated some of the prothrombothic mutations and polymorphisms in 15 children with congenital cardiac malformations who developed severe thrombosis in the perioperative period following surgical repair. The mutations and polymorphisms included in the study were Factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A, methylentetrahydrofolate reductase C677T, endothelial nitric oxide synthase intron 4 VNTR, alpha-fibrinogen Thr312Ala, Factor XIII Val34Leu, and insertion or deletion of angiotensin 1 converting enzyme. Compared to the healthy Turkish subjects, our patients had a similar rate of mutation of Factor V Leiden, Factor XIII Val34Leu, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase a/b polymorphisms, but higher frequency of the prothrombotic angiotensin 1 converting enzyme deletion/deletion genotype, and lower frequency of the antithrombotic alpha fibrinogen Thr/Thr genotype. None of the patients exhibited mutations involving prothrombin G20210A or methylentetrahydrofolate reductase C677T. The results of our study suggest that, in addition to prothrombotic mutations such as Factor V Leiden, single-nucleotide polymorphisms should be considered in all children with congenital cardiac malformations who develop thrombosis. Malformations of the heart are the most common of all serious lesions that are present at birth, with an incidence of 4 to 8 cases per 1,000 live births. If needed, corrective surgery is usually the optimal treatment for these anomalies, but perioperative morbidity and mortality still remain high due to several factors. Arterial or venous thrombosis, or both varieties of thrombosis, is among these factors. Prior to surgery, the most frequent time at which these children develop thrombosis is during cardiac catheterization. Postoperative thrombosis in this group of patients is a more complex disorder, which can affect both small and large vessels, and is associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Recent studies indicate that both point mutations and single-nucleotide polymorphisms of genes that encode proteins involved in the coagulative and anticoagulative cascades are important risk factors for development of thrombosis. Patients with these risk factors are most likely to develop thrombosis when triggering elements, such as placement of catheters, prolonged immobilization, or surgery, are also present. In this study, we investigated some of the above-mentioned mutations and polymorphisms in children who developed thrombosis in the perioperative period after correction of congenital cardiac malformations.

TI	ADA*2 allele of the adenosine deaminase gene may protect against coronary artery disease.
PG	275-81
AB	BACKGROUND/AIMS: The common G22A polymorphism in the adenosine deaminase (ADA) gene leads to substitution Asp8Asn. The lower activity of the enzyme encoded by A22 (ADA*2) allele may increase tissue concentrations of adenosine, a potent cardioprotective agent. In a case-control study, we investigated the association between ADA polymorphism and coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS: A hundred and seventy-one CAD patients from the north-western part of Poland and 200 consecutive newborns from the same population were genotyped by PCR-RFLP. RESULTS: Twenty-five ADA*1/*2 heterozygotes (12.5%) and 2 ADA*2/*2 homozygotes (1%) were found in the control group, while only 10 *1/*2 heterozygotes (5.9%) and no *2/*2 homozygotes were found in the CAD group. Frequencies of ADA*2 carriers (5.9% vs. 13.5%, p = 0.015) and ADA*2 allele (2.9% vs. 7.3%, p = 0.0083) were lower in CAD patients than in controls. Among CAD patients, a significantly lower proportion of *2 allele carriers was treated with diuretics and ACE inhibitors when compared to *1/*1 wild-type homozygotes. CONCLUSION: ADA*2 allele may decrease genetic susceptibility to CAD. ADA should be added to the list of candidate genes modifying the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

TI	ACE I/D genotype, adiposity, and blood pressure in children.
PG	14
AB	BACKGROUND: Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is a possible candidate gene that may influence both body fatness and blood pressure. Although several genetic studies have been conducted in adults, relatively few studies have examined the contribution of potential candidate genes, and specifically ACE I/D, on adiposity and BP phenotypes in childhood. Such studies may prove insightful for the development of the obesity-hypertension phenotype early in life. The purpose of this study was to examine differences in body fatness and resting blood pressure (BP) by ACE I/D genotype, and determine if the association between adiposity and BP varies by ACE I/D genotype in children. METHODS: 152 children (75 girls, 77 boys) were assessed for body composition (% body fat) using dual energy x-ray absorbtiometry and resting BP according to American Heart Association recommendations. Buccal cell samples were genotyped using newly developed PCR-RFLP tests for two SNPs (rs4341 and rs4343) in complete linkage disequilibrium with the ACE I/D polymorphism. Partial correlations were computed to assess the ociations between % body fat and BP in the total sample and by genotype. ANCOVA was used to examine differences in resting BP by ACE I/D genotype and fatness groups. RESULTS: Approximately 39% of youth were overfat based on % body fat (&gt;30% fat in girls, 25% fat in boys). Body mass, body mass index, and fat-free mass were significantly higher in the ACE D-carriers compared to the II group (p &lt; 0.05). BP was not significantly different by ACE I/D genotypes. In the total sample, correlations between adiposity and BP ranged from 0.30 to 0.46, and were not significantly different between genotypes. When grouped by genotype and body fat category, the overfat D-carrier subjects had significantly higher SBP and MAP compared to the normal fat D-carrier and normal fat II groups (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: ACE D-carriers are heavier than ACE II children; however, BP did not differ by ACE I/D genotype but was adversely influenced in the overfat D-carriers. Further studies are warranted to investigate the genetics of fatness and BP phenotypes in children.

TI	Renin-angiotensin system and associated gene polymorphisms in myocardial infarction in young South African Indians.
PG	22-6
AB	The renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in cardiovascular regulation. Abnormalities in genetic components of this system, such as the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene, angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor gene and angiotensinogen (AGT) gene, may cause a variety of adverse cardiovascular effects. It was the aim of this study, therefore, to investigate the involvement of the ACE insertion/deletion (I/D), AT1 receptor 1166 A-&gt;C and AGT M235T polymorphisms as predisposing factors for myocardial infarction (MI) in 195 young South African Indians (&lt;/= 45 years). Results were compared with those obtained I n 107 unaffected siblings (18-45 years old) and 300 healthy age	and race-matched control subjects. The distribution of the ACE genotypes was the same in each of the three study groups (p-value ranged between 0.83 and 0.98). No differences were observed in the 1166 A-&gt;C AT1 receptor polymorphism with respect to both genotype and allelotype (p &gt; 0.70), or in the genotype or allele frequency distribution of the AGT M235T polymorphism (p &gt; 0.44). However, a significant in crease was noted for both the AT1 receptor C variant (p = 0.025) and the AGT T variant (p = 0.047) in hypertensive patients compared with those who were normotensive. In conclusion, results of this study indicate that the ACE I/D, the 1166 A-&gt;C AT1 receptor and AGT M235T polymorphisms do not confer any increased risk for MI in young South African Indians.

TI	[Molecular genetic study of causes of the Prader-Willi and Angelman syndrome].
PG	113-8
AB	BACKGROUND: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) are distinctive diseases with severe impairment of psychomotoric development and behaviour. Both syndromes are caused by the loss of paternal (PWS) or maternal (AS) gene expression of chromosomal region 15q11-13. The work reveals the various causes of this loss. The choice of the most suitable method for screening of the genome mutations in the patients suspected of PWS and AS is another purpose of the work. METHODS AND RESULTS: The methyl specific analysis (MS PCR) in locus SNRPN, short tandem repeat (STR) analysis and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) were used. In the group of 55 patients tested for PWS and AS only maternal allele was present in 11 patients and only paternal allele was present in 1 patient in the locus SNRPN: 10 microdeletions 15q11-13, 1 UPD(15)mat and 1 UPD(15)pat. CONCLUSIONS: MS PCR seems to be the most profitable method for the first step of selection of PWS patients. In positive cases is inevitable to use also additional tests of molecular diagnosis to distinguish the particular mechanism leading to the disorders. In AS patients is also MSPCR recommended as the first step although it is necessary to exclude mutation in UBE3A gene in case of MS PCR negativity.

TI	Association analysis of the E-selectin 98G &gt; T polymorphism and the risk of childhood ischemic stroke.
PG	591-6
AB	Genes related to platelet and arterial endothelial function have been recently considered as independent risk factors for stroke. We aimed to analyze a relationship between the E-selectin 98G &gt; T polymorphism and stroke in children and to observe the transmission of E-selectin alleles from heterozygous parents to their affected children. We studied 59 children after stroke, 112 parents, and 87 healthy children. The E-selectin 98G &gt; T polymorphism was analyzed with the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. The frequency of the 98T allele in patients was almost twofold lower than in controls (5.1% vs. 9.8%, p = 0.145, odds ratios (OR) = 0.49) as well as carriers of the 98T allele (19.5% in controls vs. 8.5% in cases, p = 0.067, OR = 0.38). The G allele of the E-selectin 98G &gt; T polymorphism was more frequently transmitted to the children after stroke compared to the T allele (68% vs. 32%). In conclusion, we did not confirm the relationship between the 98G &gt; T polymorphism of the E-selectin gene and childhood ischemic stroke. There is still a need for further studies.

TI	Environmental and genetic risk factors in obesity.
PG	83-94
AB	Because of its high prevalence and the associated medical and psychosocial risks, research into the causes of childhood obesity has experienced a tremendous upswing. Formal genetic data based on twin, adoption, and family studies lead to the conclusion that at least 50% of the interindividual variance of the body mass index (BMI; defined as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) is due to genetic factors. As a result of the recent advent of genome-wide association studies, the first polygenes involved in body weight regulation have been detected. Each of the predisposing alleles explain a few hundred grams of body weight. More polygenes will be detected in the near future, thus for the first time allowing in-depth analyses of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. They also will enable developmental studies to assess the effect of such alleles throughout childhood and adulthood. The recent increase in obesity prevalence rates illustrates the extreme relevance of environmental factors for body weight. Similar to polygenes, the effect sizes of most such environmental factors are likely to be small, thus rendering their detection difficult. In addition, the validation of the true causality of such factors is not a straightforward task. Important factors are socioeconomic status and television consumption. The authors conclude by briefly assessing implications for treatment and prevention of childhood obesity.

TI	MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms and cerebral stroke in two twin gestations.
PG	665-9
AB	BACKGROUND: Stroke in pediatric age is a rare event with a multifactorial genesis which could involve genetic factors as methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T and A1298C polymorphism. At the same time, twin gestation with co-twin demise is an important potential risk factor for premature brain damage. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We describe two children presenting with presumed cerebral stroke born from two MC twin pregnancies in which the other co-twin had died in utero associated to maternal and fetal homozygosity for MTHFR C677T and MTHFR A1298C, respectively. Brain damage was diagnosed immediately before the delivery. CONCLUSION: Our observations underline the necessity to make a thrombophilia workup in women before or during pregnancy and, above all, in twin pregnancy. Data of literature are not clear about what kind of genetic polymorphism is prominent in the genesis of cerebral stroke (factor V leiden, MTHFR, activated protein C resistance, factor II G20210A). A multifactorial genesis for severe fetal and perinatal cerebral vascular alterations has been supposed; for this reason an early folate supplementation both to mother and infant could reduce the risk of brain damage due to fetal/perinatal stroke and eventual recurrence of thrombotic events.

TI	Epigenetics in neonatal diseases.
PG	2948-54
AB	OBJECTIVE: To review the role of epigenetic regulation in neonatal diseases and better understand Barker's &quot;fetal origins of adult disease hypothesis&quot;. DATA SOURCES: The data cited in this review were mainly obtained from the articles published in Medline/PubMed between January 1953 and December 2009. STUDY SELECTION: Articles associated with epigenetics and neonatal diseases were selected. RESULTS: There is a wealth of epidemiological evidence that lower birth weight is strongly correlated with an increased risk of adult diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. This phenomenon of fetal origins of adult disease is strongly associated with fetal insults to epigenetic modifications of genes. A potential role of epigenetic modifications in congenital disorders, transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM), intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) have been studied. CONCLUSIONS: Acknowledgment of the role of these epigenetic modifications in neonatal diseases would be conducive to better understanding the pathogenesis of these diseases, and provide new insight for improved treatment and prevention of later adult diseases.

TI	A novel mutation in proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 gene leads to familial hypercholesterolemia in a Chinese family.
PG	1133-8
AB	BACKGROUND: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal disorder associated with elevated plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels leading to premature coronary heart disease (CHD). As a result of long-term hyperlipemia, FH patients will present endarterium thickening and artherosclerosis. In the present study we scanned the related gene of a clinically diagnosed autosomal genetic hypercholesterolemia family for the possible mutations and established eukaryotic expression vector of mutation of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) gene with gene recombination technique to investigate the contributions of the variation on low density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) metabolism and function alternation. METHODS: Mutation detection was conducted for LDL-R, apolipoprotein B(100) (apoB(100)) and PCSK9 gene with nucleotide sequencing in a Chinese FH family. The full-length cDNA of wild type PCSK9 gene (WT-PCSK9) was obtained from Bel-7402. Site mutagenesis was used to establish the recombinant eukaryotic expression vector carrying pathogenic type of PCSK9 gene and the inserted fragment was sequenced. With the blank vector as control, liposome transfection method was used to transfect the Bel-7402 cells with recombinant plasmid. The expression of LDL-R mRNA was examined by RT-PCR. PCSK9 and the expression of LDL-R protein were determined by Western blotting. RESULTS: The G--&gt;T mutation at the 918 nucleotide of PCSK9 gene resulted in the substitution of the arginine by a serine at the codon 306 of exon 6. After sequencing, it was confirmed that the inserted fragment of established expression vector had correct size and sequence and the mutant was highly expressed in Bel-7402 cells. There was no significant variation in the levels of LDL-R mRNA. LDL-R mature protein was decreased by 57% after the cells were transfected by WT-PCSK9 plasmid. Mature LDL-R was significantly decreased by 12% after the cells were transfected by R306S mutant as evidenced by gray scale scanning, suggesting that the new mutant R306S can significantly decrease the expression of mature LDL-R protein. CONCLUSIONS: A novel missense mutation of PCSK9 gene, R306S, was found and the eukaryotic expression vectors of mutant and wild-type of PCSK9 gene were established. There was no significant variation in the levels of LDL-R mRNA. The R306S mutation could significantly lead to the decrease of LDL-R mature protein expression, which might be the pathogenic gene of the FH family.

TI	Mutational heterogeneity, modifier genes, and environmental influences contribute to phenotypic diversity of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy.
PG	323-30
AB	BACKGROUND: Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy is one of the leading causes of sudden cardiac death in the &lt; or =35-year age group. The broad phenotypic spectrum encompasses left-dominant and biventricular subtypes, characterized by early left ventricular involvement, as well as the classic right-dominant form, better known as arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Mendelian inheritance patterns are accompanied by incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity, the latter manifesting as diversity in morphology, arrhythmic burden, and clinical outcomes. METHODS AND RESULTS: To investigate the role of mutational heterogeneity, genetic modifiers and environmental influences in arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, we studied phenotype variability in 9 quantitative traits among an affected-only sample of 231 cases from 48 families. Heritability was estimated by variance component analysis as a guide to the combined influence of mutational and genetic background heterogeneity. Nested ANOVA was used to distinguish mutational and genetic modifier effects. Heritability estimates ranged from 20% to 77%, being highest for left ventricular ejection fraction and right-to-left ventricular volume ratio and lowest for the ventricular arrhythmia grade, suggesting differing genetic and environmental contributions to these traits. ANOVA models indicated a predominant mutation effect for the left ventricular lesion score, an indicator of the extent of fat and late enhancement on cardiovascular magnetic resonance. In contrast, the modifier genetic effect appeared significant for right ventricular end-diastolic volume, ejection fraction, and lesion score; left ventricular ejection fraction; ventricular volume ratio; and arrhythmic events. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic investigation of modifier genes and environmental influences will be pivotal to understanding clinical diversity in arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, refining prognostication, and developing targeted therapies.

TI	Associations of lipoprotein lipase gene polymorphisms with longitudinal plasma lipid trends in young adults: The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study.
PG	179-86
AB	BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies in European Americans have reported several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the lipoprotein lipase gene associated with plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides. However, the influences of the lipoprotein lipase SNPs on longitudinal changes of these lipids have not been systematically examined. METHODS AND RESULTS: On the basis of data from 2045 African Americans and 2116 European Americans in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study, we investigated cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of lipids with 8 lipoprotein lipase SNPs, including the 2 that have been reported in genome-wide association studies. Plasma levels of HDL-C and triglycerides were measured at 7 examinations during 20 years of follow-up. In European Americans, rs328 (Ser447Stop), rs326, and rs13702 were significantly associated with cross-sectional interindividual variations in triglycerides and HDL-C (P&lt;0.005) and with their longitudinal changes over time (P&lt;0.05). The minor alleles in rs326, rs328, and rs13702 that predispose an individual to lower triglycerides and higher HDL-C levels at young adulthood further slow down the trajectory increase in triglycerides and decrease in HDL-C during 20 years of follow-up. In African Americans, these 3 SNPs were significantly associated with triglycerides, but only rs326 and rs13702 were associated with HDL-C (P&lt;0.008). Rs328 showed a stronger association in European Americans than in African Americans, and adjustment for it did not remove all of the associations for the other SNPs. Longitudinal changes in either trait did not differ significantly by SNP genotypes in African Americans. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that aging interacts with LPL gene variants to influence the longitudinal lipid variations, and there is population-related heterogeneity in the longitudinal associations.

TI	Longitudinal association of PCSK9 sequence variations with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels: the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study.
PG	354-61
AB	BACKGROUND: Mutations of PCSK9 are associated cross-sectionally with plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, but little is known about their longitudinal association with LDL-C levels from young adulthood to middle age. METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated the associations of 6 PCSK9 variants with LDL-C over 20 years in 1750 blacks and 1828 whites from the Coronary Artery Risk Development In Young Adults study. Generalized estimating equations were used to assess longitudinal differences in LDL-C levels between genotype categories. For blacks, LDL-C levels at age 18 were significantly lower (P&lt;0.001) among those with 3 genetic variants (L253F, C679X, and Y142X; 81.5 mg/dL) and A443T (95.5 mg/dL) compared with noncarriers (109.6 mg/dL). The difference in LDL-C levels from noncarriers tended to widen for those with the 3 variants only, by 0.24 mg/dL per year of age (P=0.14). For whites with the R46L variant, compared with noncarriers, LDL-C levels at age 18 were significantly lower (84.4 mg/dL versus 100.9 mg/dL; P&lt;0.001), and the increase in LDL-C with age was similar to noncarriers. The 3 genetic variants and the A443T variant in black men were associated with lower carotid intima-media thickness and lower prevalence of coronary calcification measured at ages 38 to 50. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that participants with several genetic variants of PCSK9 have persistently lower serum LDL-C levels than noncarriers from ages 18 to 50. Such long-term reduction in LDL-C levels is associated with reduced subclinical atherosclerosis burden in black men.

TI	Pharmacogenetic predictors of statin-mediated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction and dose response.
PG	100-6
AB	BACKGROUND: There is interindividual variation in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) lowering by statins and limited study into the genetic associations of the dose dependant LDLc lowering by statins. METHODS AND RESULTS: Five hundred nine patients with hyperlipidemia were randomly assigned atorvastatin 10 mg, simvastatin 20 mg, or pravastatin 10 mg (low-dose phase) followed by 80 mg, 80 mg, and 40 mg (high-dose phase), respectively. Thirty-one genes in statin, cholesterol, and lipoprotein metabolism were sequenced and 489 single nucleotide polymorphisms with minor allele frequencies &gt;2% were tested for associations with percentage LDLc lowering at low doses using multivariable adjusted general linear regression. Significant associations from the analysis at low dose were then repeated at high-dose statins. At low doses, only 1 single nucleotide polymorphism met our experiment-wide significance level, ABCA1 rs12003906. Twenty-six subjects carried the minor allele of rs12003906, which was associated with an attenuated LDLc reduction (LDLc reduction in carriers versus noncarriers -24.1+/-2.6% versus -32.2+/-1.5%; P=0.0001). In addition, we replicated the association with the APOE epsilon3 allele and a reduced LDLc reduction. At high doses, carriers of the minor allele of ABCA1 rs12003906 and the APOE epsilon3 allele improved their LDLc reduction but continued to have a diminished LDLc reduction compared with noncarriers (-30.5+/-4.0% versus -42.0+/-2.4%; P=0.005) and (-38.5+/-1.9% versus -45.3+/-2.8%; P=0.009), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: An intronic single nucleotide polymorphism in ABCA1 and the APOE epsilon3 allele are associated with reduced LDLc lowering by statins and identify individuals who may be resistant to maximal LDLc lowering by statins.

TI	Reduced ACTC1 expression might play a role in the onset of congenital heart disease by inducing cardiomyocyte apoptosis.
PG	2410-8
AB	BACKGROUND: The Cardiac alpha actin 1 gene (ACTC1) has been related to familial atrial septal defects. This study was set to explore a potential role of this gene in the formation of sporadic congenital heart disease (CHD). METHODS AND RESULTS: Assessment of cardiac tissue samples from 33 patients with sporadic CHD (gestational age (GA) 18 weeks-49 months) with real-time RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry has revealed a markedly decreased ACTC1 expression in the majority of samples (78.8%) compared with autopsied normal heart tissue from aged-matched subjects (GA 17 weeks-36 months). Also, as shown by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay, the proportion of apoptotic cardiomyocytes in samples featuring down-regulated ACTC1 expression (Group 1) was significantly greater than those with normal expression (Group 2) and the controls (P&lt;0.01). The proportion of apoptotic cells strongly correlated with the expression of ACTC1 (r=-0.918, P&lt;0.01). A study of 2 essential genes involved in apoptosis, Caspase-3 and Bcl-2, confirmed that the former has significantly increased expression, whilst the latter has decreased expression in Group 1 than in the other groups (P&lt;0.01). Transfection of a small interfering RNA targeting, Actc1 (Actc1-siRNA), to a cardiomyocyte cell line, H9C2, also detected more apoptotic cells. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced ACTC1 expression might play a role in the onset of CHD through induction of cardiomyocyte apoptosis.

TI	Pro12Ala polymorphism of the peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor-gamma gene is associated with metabolic syndrome and surrogate measures of insulin resistance in healthy men: interaction with smoking status.
PG	2118-24
AB	BACKGROUND: The Pro12Ala polymorphism (rs1801282), a nonsynonymous substitution of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARG), has been robustly associated with type 2 diabetes. However, its role in metabolic syndrome (MetS) remains poorly understood. The associations among rs1801282, MetS and surrogate measures of insulin resistance (IR) were investigated in the present study. METHODS AND RESULTS: A cross-sectional population-based survey of 572 unrelated healthy male Argentinian blood donors with normal findings on medical examination and not taking any medication was conducted. MetS was assessed using the National Cholesterol Education Program/Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP/ATP III) criteria, and the HOMA-IR, and QUICKI were calculated. Genotyping of rs1801282 was performed using RFLP-PCR. The prevalence of MetS was 26.2%. The Pro/Ala genotype (and the Ala12 allele) was associated with a high risk for MetS (odds ratio (OR) 1.67 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-2.72], P=0.0394). This was highlighted among nonsmokers (OR 2.20 [95%CI 1.25-3.88], P=0.0059). ANCOVA confirmed an interaction between smoking status and this association (P=0.031). Ala12 carriers had a higher waist circumference than noncarriers (P=0.0065). Among nonsmokers, surrogates of IR, such as HOMA-IR, were significantly higher in Ala12 carriers than in noncarriers (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Healthy men, in particular nonsmokers, carrying the Ala12 allele of PPARG rs1801282 polymorphism, have a high risk for MetS and IR.

TI	Milk fat globule protein epidermal growth factor-8: a pivotal relay element within the angiotensin II and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 signaling cascade mediating vascular smooth muscle cells invasion.
PG	1337-46
AB	Advancing age induces aortic wall thickening that results from the concerted effects of numerous signaling proteins, many of which have yet to be identified. To search for novel proteins associated with aortic wall thickening, we have performed a comprehensive quantitative proteomic study to analyze aortic proteins from young (8 months) and old (30 months) rats and identified 50 proteins that significantly change in abundance with aging. One novel protein, the milk fat globule protein epidermal growth factor 8 (MFG-E8), increases 2.3-fold in abundance in old aorta. Transcription and translation analysis demonstrated that aortic MFG-E8 mRNA and protein levels increase with aging in several mammalian species including humans. Dual immunolabeling shows that MFG-E8 colocalizes with both angiotensin II and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 within vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) of the thickened aged aortic wall. Exposure of early passage VSMCs from young aorta to angiotensin II markedly increases MFG-E8 and enhances invasive capacity to levels observed in VSMCs from old rats. Treatment of VSMCs with MFG-E8 increases MCP-1 expression and VSMCs invasion that are inhibited by the MCP-1 receptor blocker vCCI. Silencing MFG-E8 RNA substantially reduces MFG-E8 expression and VSMCs invasion capacity. The data indicate that arterial MFG-E8 significantly increases with aging and is a pivotal relay element within the angiotensin II/MCP-1/VSMC invasion signaling cascade. Thus, targeting of MFG-E8 within this signaling axis pathway is a potential novel therapy for the prevention and treatment of the age-associated vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis.

TI	Apolipoprotein AIV gene variant S347 is associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease and lower plasma apolipoprotein AIV levels.
PG	969-75
AB	The impact of common variants in the apolipoprotein gene cluster (APOC3-A4-A5) on prospective coronary heart disease (CHD) risk was examined in healthy UK men. Of the 2808 men followed over 9 years, 187 had a clinically defined CHD event. Examination of 9 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in this group revealed that homozygotes for APOA4 S347 had significantly increased risk of CHD [hazard ratio (HR) of 2.07 (95%CI 1.04 to 4.12)], whereas men homozygous for APOC3 1100T were protected [HR 0.28 (95%CI 0.09 to 0.87)]. In stepwise multiple regression analysis, after entering all the variants and adjusting for established risk factors APOA4 T347S alone remained in the model. Using all nine SNPs, the highest risk-estimate haplotypes carried APOA4 S347 and rare alleles of the two flanking intergenic markers. The protective effect of APOC3 1100T could be explained by negative linkage disequilibrium with these alleles. To determine the association of APOA4 T347S with apoAIV levels, the relationship was examined in 1600 healthy young European men and women. S347 homozygotes had significantly lower apoAIV plasma levels (13.64+/-0.59 mg/dL) compared with carriers of the T347 allele (14.90+/-0.12 mg/dL) (P=0.035). These results demonstrate that genetic variation in and around APOA4, independent of the effects of triglyceride, is associated with risk of CHD and apoAIV levels, supporting an antiatherogenic role for apoAIV.

TI	Glu298Asp endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene polymorphism interacts with environmental and dietary factors to influence endothelial function.
PG	1153-8
AB	An endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene polymorphism (Glu298Asp) has been associated with cardiovascular disease. We investigated whether carriage of the polymorphism was associated with functional changes in the endothelium, and how genotype altered the harmful and beneficial impact of environmental influences on the endothelium. Endothelium-dependent, flow-mediated brachial artery dilatation (FMD) and endothelium-independent dilatation response to glyceryl trinitrate were measured using high-resolution ultrasound in 248 subjects (131 female, 117 male, aged 20 to 28) genotyped for the Glu298Asp polymorphism. Vascular function was compared between genotype groups and interactions with the proatherogenic risk factor, smoking, and the antiatherogenic influence of n-3 fatty acids (n-3FA) were investigated. Vascular function was not related to genotype in the group as a whole or within sexes. However, among males, smoking was associated with lower FMD in Asp298 carriers (nonsmokers 0.125+/-0.085 mm versus smokers 0.070+/-0.060 mm, P=0.006) but not in Glu298 homozygotes (nonsmokers 0.103+/-0.090 mm versus smokers 0.124+/-0.106, P=0.5). In the whole group, n-3FA levels were positively related to FMD in Asp298 carriers (reg coeff=0.023 mm/%, P=0.04, r=0.20) but not in Glu298 homozygotes (reg coeff=-0.019 mm/%, P=0.1). These differences between genotype groups were significant in interaction models. The Glu298Asp polymorphism is associated with differences in endothelial responses to both smoking and n-3 FA in healthy young subjects. These findings raise the possibility of genotype-specific prevention strategies in cardiovascular disease.

TI	Blood pressure and hypertension are associated with 7 loci in the Japanese population.
PG	2302-9
AB	BACKGROUND: Two consortium-based genome-wide association studies have recently identified robust and significant associations of common variants with systolic and diastolic blood pressures in populations of European descent, warranting further investigation in populations of non-European descent. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined the associations at 27 loci reported by the genome-wide association studies on Europeans in a screening panel of Japanese subjects (n=1526) and chose 11 loci showing association signals (1-tailed test in the screening, P&lt;0.3) for an extensive replication study with a follow-up panel of 3 Japanese general-population cohorts (n &lt; or =24 300). Significant associations were replicated for 7 loci-CASZ1, MTHFR, ITGA9, FGF5, CYP17A1-CNNM2, ATP2B1, and CSK-ULK3-with any or all of these 3 traits: systolic blood pressure (P=1.4x10(-14) to 0.05), diastolic blood pressure (P=1.9x10(-12) to 0.05), and hypertension (P=2.0x10(-14) to 0.006; odds ratio, 1.10 to 1.29). The strongest association was observed for FGF5. In the whole study panel, the variance (R(2)) for blood pressure explained by the 7 single-nucleotide polymorphism loci was calculated to be R(2)=0.003 for male and 0.006 for female participants. Stratified analysis implied the potential presence of a gene-age-sex interaction, although it did not reach a conclusive level of statistical significance after adjustment for multiple testing. CONCLUSIONS: We have confirmed 7 loci associated with blood pressure and/or hypertension in the Japanese. These loci can guide fine-mapping efforts to pinpoint causal variants and causal genes with the integration of multiethnic results.

TI	Riboflavin lowers homocysteine in individuals homozygous for the MTHFR 677C-&gt;T polymorphism.
PG	74-80
AB	BACKGROUND: Meta-analyses predict that a 25% lowering of plasma homocysteine would reduce the risk of coronary heart disease by 11% to 16% and stroke by 19% to 24%. Individuals homozygous for the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C--&gt;T polymorphism have reduced MTHFR enzyme activity resulting from the inappropriate loss of the riboflavin cofactor, but it is unknown whether their typically high homocysteine levels are responsive to improved riboflavin status. METHODS AND RESULTS: From a register of 680 healthy adults 18 to 65 years of age of known MTHFR 677C--&gt;T genotype, we identified 35 with the homozygous (TT) genotype and age-matched individuals with heterozygous (CT, n=26) or wild-type (CC, n=28) genotypes to participate in an intervention in which participants were randomized by genotype group to receive 1.6 mg/d riboflavin or placebo for a 12-week period. Supplementation increased riboflavin status to the same extent in all genotype groups (8% to 12% response in erythrocyte glutathione reductase activation coefficient; P&lt;0.01 in each case). However, homocysteine responded only in the TT group, with levels decreasing by as much as 22% overall (from 16.1+/-1.5 to 12.5+/-0.8 micromol/L; P=0.003; n=32) and markedly so (by 40%) in those with lower riboflavin status at baseline (from 22.0+/-2.9 and 13.2+/-1.0 micromol/L; P=0.010; n=16). No homocysteine response was observed in the CC or CT groups despite being preselected for suboptimal riboflavin status. CONCLUSIONS: Although previously overlooked, homocysteine is highly responsive to riboflavin, specifically in individuals with the MTHFR 677 TT genotype. Our findings might explain why this common polymorphism carries an increased risk of coronary heart disease in Europe but not in North America, where riboflavin fortification has existed for &gt;50 years.

TI	Variation in the region of the angiotensin-converting enzyme gene influences interindividual differences in blood pressure levels in young white males.
PG	1773-9
AB	BACKGROUND: The renin-angiotensin system regulates blood pressure through its effects on vascular tone, renal hemodynamics, and renal sodium and fluid balance. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using data from a large population-based sample of 1488 siblings having a mean age of 14.8 years and belonging to the youngest generation of 583 randomly ascertained three-generation pedigrees from Rochester, Minn, we carried out variance components-based linkage analyses to evaluate the contribution of variation in four renin-angiotensin system gene regions (angiotensinogen, renin, angiotensin I-converting enzyme, and angiotensin II receptor type 1) to interindividual variation in systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure. We rejected the null hypothesis that allelic variation in the region of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene does not contribute to interindividual blood pressure variability. After conditioning on measured covariates, variation in this region accounted for 0%, 13% (P=0.04), and 16% (P=0.04) of the interindividual variance in systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures, respectively. These estimates were even greater in a subset of subjects with a positive family history of hypertension (0%, 29% [P=0.005], and 32% [P&lt;0.005], respectively). In sex-specific analyses, genetic variation in the region of the ACE gene significantly influenced interindividual blood pressure variation in males (37% for SBP [P=0.03], 38% for DBP [P=0.04], and 53% for MAP [P&lt;0.005]) but not in females. CONCLUSIONS: Although it is possible that variation in a gene near the ACE gene may explain the observed results, knowledge about the physiological involvement of ACE in blood pressure regulation supports the proposition that the ACE gene itself influences blood pressure variability in a sex-specific manner.

TI	Association between an angiotensinogen microsatellite marker in children and coronary events in their grandparents.
PG	2092-6
AB	BACKGROUND: Recently we found that the deletion (D) allele of the insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the ACE gene in 404 children was associated with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) in their grandparents. This led us to explore polymorphisms in other genes of the renin-angiotensin system in this same population. METHODS AND RESULTS: We determined the genotypes for three microsatellite markers located near or in the angiotensinogen, angiotensin II (type-1) receptor, and renin genes in the children and related the allele frequencies to grandparental CAD. We found a significant association between the angiotensinogen marker in children and grandparental CAD (chi2 = 42.2, P = .00001) with these children having an excess of the 125-bp and 129-bp alleles (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.7 to 3.7). Greatest grandparental risk was when their grandchildren had the 125-bp/125-bp, 129-bp/129-bp, or 125-bp/129-bp genotypes (odds ratio, 7.75; 95% confidence interval, 2.2 to 27). There was no association between the microsatellites at either the angiotensin II (type-1) receptor (P = .8) or renin (P = .2) genes in children and grandparental CAD and none between the angiotensinogen and ACE polymorphisms in relation to CAD family history. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies a significant association between an angiotensinogen marker in children and grandparental CAD. There was no association between the microsatellites at either the angiotensin II (type-1) receptor or renin genes and CAD in this population. We conclude that the angiotensinogen polymorphism as well as the ACE polymorphism may explain a part of the risk related to a family history of CAD.

TI	Influence of angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin II type 1 receptor gene polymorphisms on aortic stiffness in normotensive and hypertensive patients.
PG	698-703
AB	BACKGROUND: Clinical and experimental studies have demonstrated a major role of the renin-angiotensin system in the functional and structural changes of the large arteries in hypertension. Because genetic studies may help us to understand the mechanisms underlying the involvement of this system in arterial regulation, the present study was designed to assess the contribution of polymorphisms of the ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AGTR1 A 1166C) genes on aortic stiffness regulation. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study included 311 untreated hypertensive and 128 normotensive subjects. Aortic stiffness was evaluated by measurement of the carotid-femoral pulse-wave velocity (PWV). In normotensive subjects, the two polymorphisms did not influence any of the studied parameters. In hypertensive subjects, there was a decreasing trend of mean PWV with the number of ACE D alleles, but this association became significant only after adjustment for blood pressure (P &lt; .05). Conversely, the AGTR1 A 1166C polymorphism was independently associated with aortic stiffness. Mean values of PWV were 11.6 +/	2.7 m/s in AGTR1 AA homozygotes, 13.3 +/	3.3 m/s in AC heterozygotes, and 15.3 +/	4.3 m/s in CC homozygotes (P &lt; .0001 and P &lt; .00001 after adjustment for age and mean blood pressure, respectively). The percentage of variance of PWV explained by AGTR1 A 1166C polymorphism (11.6%) was much larger than that of ACE I/D polymorphism (1.7%). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that in hypertensive but not normotensive subjects, the AGTR1 and ACE genotypes are involved in the regulation of aortic rigidity. The presence of the AGTR1 C allele is a strong independent determinant of aortic stiffness, whereas presence of the ACE 1 allele is weakly associated with increased stiffness.

TI	Angiotensin-converting enzyme in the human heart. Effect of the deletion/insertion polymorphism.
PG	1387-8
AB	BACKGROUND: An insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene has been associated with differences in the plasma levels of ACE as well as with myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy, and coronary artery disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: We determined the cardiac ACE activity and the ACE genotype in 71 subjects who died of noncardiac disorders. Cardiac ACE activity was significantly higher (P &lt; .01) in subjects with the ACE DD genotype (12.7 +/	1.9 mU/g wet wt) compared with subjects with the ID (8.7 +/	0.8 mU/g) and the II (9.1 +/	1.0 mU/g) genotypes. This difference was independent of sex, age, and the time required for tissue collection. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac ACE activity is highest in subjects with the DD genotype. Elevated cardiac ACE activity in these subjects may result in increased cardiac angiotensin II levels, and this may be a mechanism underlying the reported association between the ACE deletion polymorphism and the increased risk for several cardiovascular disorders.

TI	The importance of thrombotic risk factors in the development of idiopathic sudden hearing loss.
PG	356-9
AB	Impaired cochlear blood circulation has been suggested to cause sudden hearing loss. In this study, the role of factor V 1691 G-A (FV 1691 G-A), prothrombin 20210 G-A (PT 20210 G-A), methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase 677 C-T (MTHFR 677 C-T), factor V 4070 A-G (FV 4070 A-G), endothelial cell protein C receptor (EPCR) gene 23-bp insertion, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) 4G/5G mutation was assessed. Fifty-three patients with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss and 80 individuals comprising the control group were included in this study. The frequency for FV 1691 A was 6.2% in the patient group and 3.7% in the control group, PT 20210 G-A was 1.2% in the patient group and 1.9% in the control group, and FV 4070 A-G was 7.5% in the patient group and 11.3% in the control group. The frequency of MTHFR 677 C-T was significantly higher in the patient group than in the control group, with a P value of .03. PAI-1-675 4G/5G polymorphism was found to be 71.2% and 69.8%, in the control group and the patient group, respectively. The EPCR 23-bp insertion was 0% in the control group and was found in 3 patients (3.7%), which needs further study.

TI	Factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene G20210A variant, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T genotype in young adults with ischemic stroke.
PG	346-50
AB	Ischemic stroke in young adults is a well-known disease, but despite extensive clinical and laboratory investigations, its etiology remains unclear in approximately half of the cases. We examined the prevalence of factor V Leiden, the prothrombin G20210A genotype, and the C677T mutation in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene in 100 patients (51 males and 49 females) who survived an ischemic stroke without a cardiac embolic source at an age &lt; or = 45 years, and in 238 healthy control subjects from the same geographic area. The patients were selected for study only if the diagnosis of stroke was documented by computed tomography scan or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of the brain, or both. Heterozygosity for the FV Leiden mutation was found in 3 patients (3.0%) and in 10 control subjects (4.2%). Two patients (2.0%) and five control subjects (2.1%) were heterozygous for the prothrombin G20210A mutation. The frequencies of the MTHFR 677TT, CT, and CC genotypes in the patient group were 12%, 37%, and 51%, respectively, and were not significantly different from those in control subjects (11%, 40%, and 49%, respectively). In conclusion, our results indicate that FV Leiden mutation, prothrombin G20210A genotype, and homozygosity for the C677T mutation in the MTHFR gene are not associated with an increased risk for ischemic stroke in young adults.

TI	Heritability of genetic variants of resistin gene in patients with coronary artery disease: a family-based study.
PG	618-22
AB	OBJECTIVE: The resistin gene (RETN) -420C&gt;G and +299G&gt;A polymorphism was investigated in a case-control study from forty complex Pakistani families with coronary artery disease (CAD) history. Heritability of the susceptible/variant alleles was investigated from parent-offspring trios in these families. METHOD: Resistin levels were determined from 239 individuals by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism. RESULTS: Elevated resistin levels were observed from CAD cases vs. controls (p&lt;0.0001). The RETN -420C&gt;G and +299G&gt;A polymorphism was more prevalent in cases vs. controls (p&lt;0.0001). The transmission disequilibrium test revealed a significant association of the -420 and +299 polymorphism with CAD (chi(2)=34.4, p&lt;0.0001 and chi(2)=31.6, p&lt;0.0001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Elevated resistin, and the RETN -420C&gt;G and +299G&gt;A polymorphism may contribute to familial CAD. The -420 and +299 variant alleles are transmitted more frequently from parent to affected offspring. This is the first report on the association of the RETN +299G&gt;A polymorphism with CAD.

TI	Reduced hGC-1 protein expression is associated with malignant progression of colon carcinoma.
PG	1041-9
AB	PURPOSE: hGC-1 (human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-stimulated clone 1) is a gastrointestinal protein that is a member of the olfactomedin glycoprotein family. Its biological function remains poorly understood. Aberrant expression of hGC-1 in some human carcinomas has been recently reported. The purpose of this study was to examine hGC-1 expression in colon carcinoma and explore the relationship between hGC-1 expression and the clinicopathologic features of patients with colon cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The expression of hGC-1 in colon adenocarcinoma tissues was examined by dot-blot analysis, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. The association of hGC-1 expression pattern with patient differentiation grade, tumor stage, metastasis, and survival were examined. To further investigate the involvement of hGC-1 in colon cancer progression, human colon carcinoma (HT-29) cells overexpressing hGC-1 were established and cell proliferation, adhesion, and migration were studied. RESULTS: Compared with normal colon mucosa, the up-regulation of hGC-1 was more frequently detected in more differentiated colon cancers, whereas down-regulation or no expression was associated with poorly differentiated colon cancers. Interestingly, hGC-1 down-regulation was also found in late tumor-node-metastasis stage, metastasis, and in patients with shorter survival. The morphology and cortical actin distribution of HT-29 cells were altered by hGC-1 overexpression. However, this did not change cell proliferation, but decreased cell adhesion and migration. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that hGC-1 is involved in colon cancer adhesion and metastasis, and that hGC-1 may be a useful marker for tumor differentiation and progression of human colon carcinoma.

TI	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) Pro12Ala polymorphism and risk for pediatric obesity.
PG	1047-50
AB	BACKGROUND: Variation in the peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) gene has been reported to alter the risk for adiposity in adults. METHODS: We investigated the gender related association between the Pro12Ala variant (rs1801282) in obesity and insulin resistance traits in 794 peri-adolescent children aged 10-12 years of Greek origin from the Gene and Diet Attica Investigation (GENDAI) cohort. RESULTS: Gender stratified analysis suggested that in peri-adolescent boys, Ala carriers exhibited lower measures of skinfold (triceps: 16.9+/-6.9 vs. 19.4+/-7.9 mm, p=0.014; subscapular: 9.6+/-4.5 vs. 11.2+/-5.4 mm, p=0.016) and lower adiponectin concentrations (3.9+/-1.3 vs. 4.7+/-2.4 microg/mL, p=0.05). In peri-adolescent girls, Ala carriers had lower insulin concentrations (7.3+/-3.7 vs. 8.5+/-4.4 microU/mL, p=0.026) and lower values of homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (1.5+/-0.8 vs. 1.8+/-0.96, p=0.019). Linear regression analysis revealed that the presence of the Ala allele in boys was a nominally significant predictor of obesity indices, including skin-folds (triceps: beta+/-SE: -2.3+/-1.1, p=0.032; subscapular: beta+/-SE: -2.3+/-1.1, p=0.04) and adiponectin concentrations (beta+/-SE: -0.7+/-0.4, p=0.05) after adjusting for potential covariates. In girls, the Ala allele was a predictor of insulin concentrations (beta+/-SE: -1.2+/-0.6, p=0.037) and HOMA-IR (beta+/-SE: -0.24+/-0.13, p=0.037). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that adiposity in children is influenced by the Pro12Ala polymorphism in a gender specific manner.

TI	5' ins/del and 3' VNTR polymorphisms in the apolipoprotein B gene in relation to lipids and coronary artery disease.
PG	329-34
AB	BACKGROUND: Studies that considered apolipoprotein B (APOB) gene polymorphisms as risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) have reported conflicting results. We sought to analyze the association between 5' ins/del and 3' VNTR polymorphisms of APOB, lipid parameters and CAD risk. METHODS: We recruited 251 patients with CAD, documented by coronary angiography, and 94 controls. Genotyping was performed by PCR. Lipids and apolipoproteins were measured. RESULTS: 5' ins/del (ins/ins, ins/del, del/del) and 3' VNTR (LL, SS, LS) polymorphism frequencies were significantly (p&lt;0.05) different between controls and CAD patients. LL and del/del were significantly associated with higher levels of apolipoprotein B (apoB), total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio and apoB/apoA-I ratio (p&lt;0.05) and with increased risk of CAD. The odds ratio for significant coronary stenosis associated with del/del was 3.2 (95% CI 1.6-36.42) (p=0.032) and with LL was 2.2 (95% CI 1.1-5.1) (p=0.042). CONCLUSIONS: The two polymorphisms exert an impact on lipid levels and contribute to the susceptibility to the development of CAD.

TI	Highest accuracy of combined consensus clinical criteria and SNRPN gene molecular markers in diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome in Thai patients.
PG	972-80
AB	BACKGROUND: Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a complex human genetic disease arising from a loss of paternal allele expression of imprinting genes on chromosome 15q11-q13. Normally the CpG islands at this site are heavily methylated in the maternal allele, but unmethylated in the paternal allele and therefore activated in gene expression. only the methylated allele should present in pws patients when methylation-specific pcr (msp) is analyzed. METHODS: This paper reports an analysis of PWS in Thai patients using consensus diagnostic criteria based on a combination of clinical data, basic G-banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) cytogenetics, PCR-based methylation assay, and bisulfite sequencing of the CpG islands of SNRPN to confirm 15q deletion or the methylation pattern of the SNRPN promoter and exon 1. Lack of complete clinical reports or inadequacy of the minimum laboratory support required had made it difficult to diagnose PWS, Angelman syndrome and other microdeletion disorders. RESULTS: Accuracy of 100% was obtained for diagnosis of the PWS study patients using the minimum requirements necessary. A total of 20 patients were diagnosed as PWS based on clinical criteria and the scoring tool for PWS, and the same approach was applied to four separate patients with some unmatched criteria but phenotypic similarity to PWS. Findings showed that 70% of those clinically diagnosed as PWS patients (14/20) had a deletion at 15q11-q13 according to FISH, while all 20 patients showed MSP positive of SNRPN gene. Six cases (30%) without a paternal deletion were confirmed to have maternal uniparental disomy (mUPD) of PWS by MSP and methylation sequencing approaches. Noteworthy, two of the six cases with mUPD were 3.5 year-old twins. None of the five cases with scores lower than the reported consensus criteria showed positive G-band, FISH or MSP results. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate here the high power of combining clinical findings, FISH and MSP in definitive diagnosis of PWS and in distinguishing between the two major different types of molecular mechanisms. No false positives or false negatives were observed in our analysis.

TI	Inter-individual variation of inflammatory markers of cardiovascular risks and diseases.
PG	671-84
AB	Cardiovascular diseases are a real public health problem and have multifactorial origin. Full comprehension of these diseases is very difficult because of their clinical and biological heterogeneity. The best way to understand the development of these diseases is to first investigate each biological system involved in the diseases and secondly, interactions between them. Studying intermediate phenotype variation for these biological systems is a new and promising approach for their elucidation. Among these metabolic systems, inflammation is known to be implicated in the occurrence and worsening of cardiovascular diseases. For this review, we chose to report the most important results concerning environmental, genetic and epigenetic determinants that influence intermediate phenotypes (protein and RNA levels) of inflammation. Indeed, numerous studies have investigated these determinants in healthy populations, in other words, without the influence of either disease or medication. This new approach will help to better understand the regulation of these intermediate phenotypes and to identify a panel of risk markers, which may be useful in predicting and warning those at risk and in giving adequate treatment to each patient.

TI	Association between 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T and A1298C polymorphisms and conotruncal heart defects.
PG	276-80
AB	Reports related some polymorphisms of the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) to folate-dependent neural tube defects. In view of the common origin of the cells involved both in neural tube closure and heart septation, we analyzed the MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms in mothers of children with conotruncal heart defect (CD) and in their offspring to evaluate the association between the MTHFR genotype and the risk of CD. We genotyped 103 Italian mothers with CD offspring, 200 control mothers, 103 affected children and their fathers by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. No increased risk was observed for the prevalence of the 677TT genotype by itself in affected children and in their mothers. The combined maternal 677TT/1298AA and 677CC/1298CC genotypes have odds ratio of 1.73 and 1.85, respectively. The prevalence of 1298CC genotype in the affected children gives odds ratio of 1.90, that becomes 2.31 for the 677CC/1298CC genotype. However, none of the odds ratios was statistically significant. We observed a higher frequency of the 677T allele in Italy than in other European countries. No association has been demonstrated between the 677TT MTHFR genotype and CD.

TI	The nitric oxide synthase 3 gene polymorphisms and their association with deep vein thrombosis in Asian Indian patients.
PG	649-52
AB	BACKGROUND: Endothelium derived nitric oxide is formed from l-arginine by endothelial nitric oxide synthase encoded by the nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3) gene. Nitric oxide possesses a variety of protective effects on endothelial cells and therefore NOS3 is a logical candidate gene to be investigated for the susceptibility of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients (M: F=56:44) with idiopathic deep vein thrombosis and an equal number of age and sex matched healthy controls were the study subjects. All study subjects were typed for five NOS3 polymorphisms (-786C/T, -922A/G, 894G/T, Intron 4 VNTR, and Intron 23 G10T). RESULTS: Two polymorphisms (-922A/G and 894G/T) are showing their association with DVT. -922A/G shows both genotypic (P=0.0218; chi2=5.25; O.R=1.94) as well as allelic association (P=0.0014; chi2=10.19; O.R=2.0) while 894G/T shows only allelic (P=0.04; chi2=3.93; O.R=3.93) association with DVT. CONCLUSION: Susceptibility to DVT in North Indian Asian patients may be associated with some variants of NOS3 gene.

TI	Influence of Amerindian mitochondrial DNA haplogroups on thrombosis susceptibility and frequency of four genetic prothrombotic variants in Southern Chilean subjects.
PG	444-7
AB	BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that the ethnic background may determine the susceptibility to cardiovascular diseases. Considering the genetic composition of Chilean population, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible association between Amerindian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups and venous thrombosis susceptibility and the influence on frequency of factor V 1691G&gt;A, prothrombin 20210G&gt;A, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C&gt;T and beta-fibrinogen -148C&gt;T polymorphisms in Southern Chilean population. METHODS: A total of 172 individuals, 60 patients with diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) confirmed by Doppler ultrasonography and 112 controls were included in this study. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and the Amerindian mtDNA haplogroups were detected by PCR and PCR-RFLP techniques, respectively. RESULTS: The presence of mtDNA haplogroups did not modify the thrombosis susceptibility. Of 4 SNPs genotyped, only the MTHFR 677C&gt;T variant was more frequent in DVT patients when compared to controls (OR 3.46; 95%CI, 1.50-8.00). A lower frequency of 1691G&gt;A (factor V) and a total absence of prothrombin 20210G&gt;A variants were observed in subjects with Amerindian background. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of Amerindian haplogroups did not modify the susceptibility to DVT in the studied subjects. Only MTHFR 677C&gt;T polymorphism was associated to venous thrombosis in Chilean subjects. The lower frequency of factor V 1691G&gt;A and the absence of prothrombin 20210G&gt;A polymorphism confirm the poor utility of the molecular detection of these variants in the thrombophilia study in populations with Amerindian background.

TI	Trisomy 9p and Prader-Willi syndromes in an infant resulting from a de-novo unbalanced t(9;15) translocation.
PG	103-6
AB	Trisomy 9p is a well-described dysmorphic syndrome. The physical features include hypertelorism, down-slanting palpebral fissures, deep-set eyes, down-turned corners of the mouth, and mild skeletal anomalies including hypoplastic terminal phalanges. We report an infant born with some of the typical features of trisomy 9p syndrome, as well as additional features that include extreme joint hyperlaxity with subluxation of the knees and elbows, arachnodactyly, and total anomalous pulmonary venous return. The karyotype revealed an unbalanced chromosome complement. Specifically, a derivative chromosome from a de-novo unbalanced translocation of chromosomes 9 and 15 resulted in partial trisomy of 9pter to 9q13 and deletion of the long arm of chromosome 15 proximal to band q13. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization studies and methylation analysis by Southern blotting revealed deletion of the SNRPN locus on the paternally derived chromosome 15, consistent with Prader-Willi syndrome. This infant represents the first reported case of trisomy 9p syndrome with total anomalous pulmonary venous return and hypoplasia of the amygdala and hippocampus, with the additional finding of Prader-Willi syndrome resulting from a derivative chromosome arising from an unbalanced de-novo t(9;15) translocation.

TI	Congenital hyperinsulinism: Marked clinical heterogeneity in siblings with identical mutations in the ABCC8 gene.
LID	10.1111/j.1365-2265.2011.04203.x [doi]
AB	Congenital Hyperinsulinism (CHI) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease. The clinical heterogeneity may range from mild subtle hypoglycaemia to severe life threatening hypoglycaemia. The commonest genetic cause of congenital hyperinsulinism are mutations in the genes ABCC8 and KCNJ11 encoding the two subunits (SUR1 and Kir6.2 respectively) of the pancreatic beta-cell K(ATP) channel. In the Ashkenazi Jewish population two founder mutations in the ABCC8 gene account for about 88% cases of CHI, with the splicing (c.3992-9G&gt;A) mutation being the most prevalent. We report a family with marked intrafamilial clinical variation in four haploidentical siblings who have the same homozygous c.3992-9G&gt;A mutation in the ABCC8 gene. This clinical heterogeneity ranged from having no symptoms of hypoglycaemia to having macrosomia, transient hyperinsulinism to severe hyperinsulinism and then gradual improvement over time followed by development of diabetes mellitus. It is unclear how the same mutation causes such marked clinical heterogeneity. It is possible that the clinical expression may be modified by background genetic factors and other unknown factors involved in regulating gene expression.

AB	CONTEXT: The Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) rs7903146 gene polymorphism has been associated with risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), possibly by decreasing insulin secretion. Small for gestational age (SGA) birth has been associated with type 2 DM in later life. Growth hormone (GH) treatment reduces insulin sensitivity and increases insulin secretion. Therefore, GH-treated SGA children are an ideal group to investigate whether the TCF7L2 rs7903146 genotype is associated with changes in glucose homeostasis. OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of the TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism on changes in insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity during 4 years of GH treatment in children born SGA. SUBJECTS: A total of 246 Caucasian short children born SGA, with a median age of 7.8 years. OUTCOME MEASURES: Insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion were measured by the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGT) (n = 68) and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) calculations (all). RESULTS: There was no association between rs7903146 genotype and insulin sensitivity or insulin secretion at baseline but after adjustment for possible confounders, insulin secretion was higher in the CT/TT group than in the CC group. During GH treatment, carriers of the rs7903146 T allele had an increase in insulin secretion similar to that of carriers of the CC genotype. The decrease in insulin sensitivity was only significant in the CT/TT group, but the difference in decrease between genotype groups did not reach significance (P = 0.06). The disposition index (insulin secretion x insulin sensitivity), which is an estimate of beta cell function, was not associated with genotype and did not change during GH treatment. CONCLUSION: The TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism is not associated with the change in insulin secretion during GH treatment in short SGA children.

TI	Glucocorticoid replacement is associated with hypertriglyceridaemia, elevated glucose and higher non-HDL cholesterol and may diminish the association of HDL cholesterol with the -629C&gt;A CETP promoter polymorphism in GH-receiving hypopituitary patients.
PG	359-66
AB	OBJECTIVES: The effect of glucocorticoid substitution on the prevalence of metabolic syndrome components (NCEP ATP III criteria) and serum lipid levels was determined in GH-replaced hypopituitary patients. As glucocorticoid replacement is associated with a pronounced decrease in plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity, we also tested associations of HDL cholesterol with the -629C&gt;A CETP promoter polymorphism in subjects with and without ACTH deficiency. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: In a university setting, we retrieved protocolized clinical and laboratory data from 165 adult hypopituitary patients, who had received GH for 1 year. RESULTS: After adjustment for age, sex and smoking, non-HDL cholesterol (P = 0.05) and triglycerides (P = 0.004) were higher, but HDL cholesterol was not decreased in 117 glucocorticoid (mainly cortisone acetate in two divided doses) receiving subjects compared to 48 ACTH-sufficient subjects. The prevalence of elevated plasma glucose and/or diabetes (P = 0.04) and hypertriglyceridaemia (P = 0.005), but not of other metabolic syndrome components, was higher in glucocorticoid-replaced subjects. HDL cholesterol was higher in -629 A allele carriers compared to -629CC homozygotes in ACTH-sufficient subjects (P = 0.04), but not in glucocorticoid-treated subjects (P = 0.13). Multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that only in ACTH-sufficient subjects, HDL cholesterol was independently related to this CETP gene variation (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: In GH	and glucocorticoid-replaced hypopituitary patients, serum non-HDL cholesterol and triglycerides are higher and the prevalence of hyperglycaemia is increased, but HDL cholesterol is not decreased. Conventional glucocorticoid replacement appears to diminish the association of HDL cholesterol with a common CETP gene variation.

TI	The nuclear receptor coactivator AIB3 is a modulator of HOMA beta-cell function in nondiabetic children.
PG	730-6
AB	OBJECTIVE: The amplified in breast cancer-3 protein (AIB3) is a nuclear coactivator involved in proliferation, apoptosis and development. AIB3 loss of function causes deficient insulin secretion in mice, indicating that AIB3 participates in beta-cell regulation. Our objective was to evaluate genetic variants located on AIB3 associated with beta-cell function in children and to analyse the effect of AIB3 overexpression on gene expression in insulin 1 (INS-1) beta-pancreatic cells. DESIGN: Polymorphisms from AIB3 were genotyped in 148 children with normal or low birthweights for gestational age. The effect of AIB3 overexpression on gene expression was analysed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in INS-1 cells. RESULTS: AIB3 variants were associated with homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell function (HOMA-beta-cell) in children with normal or low birthweights for gestational age, but not with HOMA of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), or with birthweight. AIB3 overexpression increased the expression of genes involved in signalling, such as IRS-1, IRS-2, IGF-II receptor or Foxo1, or of genes that control insulin secretion, such as Cplx2, Glut2 or Kv3.1 in INS-1 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that AIB3 contributes to the maintenance of beta-cell function in nondiabetic children and regulates gene expression in INS-1 cells.

TI	Insulin gene VNTR genotype is associated with insulin sensitivity and secretion in infancy.
PG	599-603
AB	AIMS: We have previously demonstrated that insulin sensitivity and secretion at age 1 year was in part related to variation in weight and height gain during infancy. In order to determine whether genetic variation at the insulin gene could also influence these associations, we have studied the relationship between insulin gene variable number of tandem repeat (INS VNTR) genotypes, insulin secretion and early postnatal growth. METHODS: We assessed fasting and dynamic insulin secretion in 99 healthy infants at age 1 year, using a short intravenous glucose tolerance test (sIVGTT). Infants were genotyped at the -23 HphI locus, as a surrogate marker for INS VNTR allele classes I and III. Anthropometric data were recorded at birth and at 1 year. Data are shown as median (interquartile range). RESULTS: Fasting insulin levels were higher in III/III infants (n = 9) than in I/I infants [n = 55; 27.4 (17.6-75.6) pmol/l vs. 18.1 (10.3-25.2) pmol/l; P &lt; 0.05]. Insulin secretion during the sIVGTT, as estimated by the serum insulin area under the curve, was also higher in III/III infants [2417 (891-4041) pmol min/l vs. 1208 (592-2284) pmol min/l; P &lt; 0.05]. Fasting and postload plasma glucose levels were similar in both groups. Analysis of covariance showed that genotype differences in fasting insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion were independent of size at birth, postnatal growth velocity and current body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: Significant associations between INS VNTR genotype and both insulin sensitivity and secretion were apparent in infancy; these might interact with childhood appetite and nutrition to impact the development of childhood obesity and insulin resistance.

TI	Study on homocysteine levels and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene variant (C677T) in a population of Buenos Aires City.
PG	574-84
AB	The substitution of cytosine (C) by thymine (T) at nucleotide 677 of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene, which converts an alanine to a valine residue, is a frequent polymorphism with reduced specific activity, associated with moderate increase in plasma homocysteine levels (tHcy) and risk of vascular diseases. OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to investigate an association of this polymorphism with tHcy and vascular risk factors. METHODS: We used a cross-sectional study on subjects affiliated to three health centers from Buenos Aires city. The diagnosis of hypertension was ascertained by patients' clinical history. Only subjects under long-term antihypertensive treatment were included. RESULTS: Samples from 138 physically active individuals (44 men and 94 women) randomly selected were included. The mean tHcy was significantly higher amongst hypertensives (HT) than normotensives (NT). The risk of hypertension was compared in subjects with CC genotype and the combined number of subjects with at least one T allele (CT/TT). There was no significant difference regarding the risk of hypertension between NT and HT groups in the overall sample. However, as obesity is considered a risk factor for hypertension development, when only HT (n = 29) and NT (n = 66) subjects with body mass index below 30 kg/m(2) (BMI&lt;30) were compared, subjects bearing CT/TT presented a significantly higher risk of hypertension than those bearing the CC genotype and significantly higher concentration of tHcy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate an association of hyper-tHcy and MTHFR C677T mutation with hypertension. MTHFR C677T mutation may contribute to hypertension or affect the development of hypertension through hyperhomocysteinemia.

TI	Insulin receptor gene in hypertension.
PG	551-65
AB	The first molecular genetic association with human essential hypertension (HT) involved the insulin receptor gene (INSR). This highly significant result in Caucasians was for an insertion/deletion polymorphism in intron 9. A polymorphism in exon 8 showed a weak association, but a microsatellite in intron 2 proved negative for HT, although has shown an association with plasma insulin in Japanese. A similar spectrum of genetic associations for variants spanning INSR has been noted for insulin-dependent diabetic patients with rapidly-progressing renal disease, a subgroup having a strong family history of essential HT. Association with HT has also been found for an INSR variant in CHinese. Insulin resistance secondary to an INSR 'defect', or other causes, would increase insulin, which has cardiovascular effects, and insulin can raise angiotensinogen. Also, insulin is co-secreted with amylin, which can increase renin secretion. In the spontaneously HT rat there is evidence for reduced down-regulation of INSR expression in response to NaCl-loading, consistent with a promoter effect. When combined with observations of insulin resistance in essential HT patients and their pre-HT offspring, the possibility of dys-regulation of INSR merits attention in disease etiology in a proportion of essential HT patients.

TI	X-chromosome inactivation analysis in a female carrier of FOXP3 mutation.
PG	127-30
AB	Immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy and enteropathy with X-linked inheritance (IPEX) is a serious disease arising from mutations in FOXP3. This gene codifies for a transcription factor whose dysfunction results in hyperactivation of T cells. It is not clear, however, why an intermediate phenotype is not seen in heterozygous females, who are completely healthy. In order to address this question, we investigated X-chromosome inactivation in peripheral blood lymphocytes from a heterozygous female with a child affected by IPEX. No preferential inactivation was shown in freshly sorted CD4+, CD8+, CD19+ cells or in IL-2 cultured CD4 and CD8 T cells, indicating that peripheral blood lymphocytes in these women are randomly selected. Moreover, only one single FOXP3 transcript was expressed by CD4 T cell clones analysed by RT-PCR, confirming that this gene is subject to X	inactivation. We hypothesize that hyper-activation of T cell in carriers of FOXP3 mutations is regulated by the presence of normal regulatory T cells.

TI	Immunogenetic risk factors for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated systemic vasculitis.
PG	412-7
AB	Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) and microscopic polyangiitis are systemic autoimmune diseases characterized by the presence of ANCA in the sera of patients. Little is known about the aetiologic factors and genetic predisposition as well as the pathogenesis of these disease entities. A slightly decreased representation of HLA-DRB1*13 and HLA-DQB1*0603 individuals was observed in our cohort of ANCA-associated systemic vasculitis (AASV) patients compared with controls. In addition, HLA-DRB1*04 individuals were over-represented in a subgroup of patients with WG in end-stage renal disease as a result of renal vasculitis. In order to identify other genes relevant for these diseases, we investigated highly polymorphic markers in the vicinity of several immunorelevant genes, i.e. tumour necrosis factor (TNF)alpha, IL-2, IL-5 receptor alpha (IL-5RA), in a group of 102 patients with AASV and compared the representation with controls. Furthermore, functional polymorphisms were directly analysed in the promotor region of TNFalpha as well as in the coding region of the FcgammaIIRA genes. Polymorphisms of the TNFalpha promotor (TNF-308) as well as in the FcgammaIIRA gene were excluded as risk factors for the disease in our cohort. No major phenotype distribution differences were observed between patients and controls for the IL-2 and IL-5RA microsatellites. Most importantly, several haplotypes on chromosome 6p appeared strongly associated with proteinase 3 (PR3)-ANCA+ AASV. Thus, as in other autoimmune diseases, different predisposing factors play differential aetiopathogenic roles in various groups of AASV patients.

TI	Autoimmune responses to the beta cell autoantigen, insulin, and the INS VNTR-IDDM2 locus.
PG	370-6
AB	Type 1 diabetes is associated with autoimmunity to insulin. Genetic susceptibility to type 1 diabetes is polygenic and includes the INS VNTR-IDDM2 locus which may regulate the expression of insulin in pancreas and thymus. In order to determine whether insulin autoimmunity could be attributed to a genetic susceptibility conferred by the INS VNTR-IDDM2 locus, peripheral blood T cell proliferation to human insulin and insulin autoantibodies (IAA) was measured in patients with new onset type 1 diabetes and control subjects. IAA were detected in 21 of 53 patients and in none of 25 control subjects, while T cell responses were low (stimulation index range 0.4-7.2) and similar in both groups. Both antibody and T cell responses were higher in younger subjects and IAA were more prevalent in patients with the HLA-DR4 allele. No relationship was observed between humoral and cellular responses to insulin. No association was found between the INS VNTR-IDDM2-susceptible allele and insulin autoimmunity. Increased T cell responses and IAA were found in patients with either the diabetes-susceptible or the diabetes-protective INS VNTR-IDDM2 locus genotypes, and increased T cell responses were also found in control subjects with either susceptible or protective INS VNTR-IDDM2 locus genotypes. This study confirms that primary T cell proliferative responses to insulin are low and detectable also in control subjects. The detection of T cell proliferation and autoantibodies to insulin in subjects with and without the protective INS VNTR-IDDM2 locus genotypes does not support the hypothesis of an allele-specific capacity for tolerance induction which could determine a susceptibility to develop autoimmunity against the insulin protein and subsequently diabetes.

TI	CTLA-4 gene polymorphism confers susceptibility to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) independently from age and from other genetic or immune disease markers. The Belgian Diabetes Registry.
PG	98-103
AB	Apart from genes in the HLA complex (IDDM1) and the variable number of tandem repeats in the 5' region of the insulin gene (INS VNTR, IDDM2), several other loci have been proposed to contribute to IDDM susceptibility. Recently, linkage and association have been shown between the cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) gene on chromosome 2q and IDDM. In a registry-based group of 525 recent-onset IDDM patients &lt;40 years old we investigated the possible interactions of a CTLA-4 gene A-to-G transition polymorphism with age at clinical disease onset and with the presence or absence of established genetic (HLA-DQ, INS VNTR) and immune disease markers (autoantibodies against islet cell cytoplasm (ICA); insulin (IAA); glutamate decarboxylase (GAD65-Ab); IA-2 protein tyrosine phosphatase (IA-2-Ab)) determined within the first week of insulin treatment. In new-onset IDDM patients. G-allele-containing CTLA-4 genotypes (relative risk (RR)= 1.5; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.2-2.0; P &lt; 0.005) were not preferentially associated with age at clinical presentation or with the presence of other genetic (HLA-DR3 or DR4 alleles; HLA-DQA1*0301-DQB1*0302 and/or DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201 risk haplotypes; INS VNTR I/I risk genotype) or immune (ICA, IAA, IA-2-Ab, GAD65-Ab) markers of diabetes. For 151 patients, thyrogastric autoantibodies (anti-thyroid peroxidase, anti-thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor, anti-parietal cell, anti-intrinsic factor) were determined, but association between CTLA-4 risk genotypes and markers of polyendocrine autoimmunity could not be demonstrated before or after stratification for HLA	or INS-linked risk. In conclusion, the presence of a G-containing CTLA-4 genotype confers a moderate but significant RR for IDDM that is independent of age and genetic or immune disease markers.

TI	MTHFR (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase) C677T polymorphism and psoriasis.
PG	327-31
AB	The aim of the study was to evaluate possible association of MTHFR C677T gene polymorphism (NM_005957) with psoriasis. Genotypes of MTHFR C677T gene polymorphism were determined in a sample of 654 Caucasian (Czech) subjects. Case group (n = 410) included patients with psoriasis (plaque psoriasis diagnosed in 285 patients, other subtypes of psoriasis were observed in 125 patients). Control group (n = 244) consisted of healthy subjects without individual history of psoriasis, with similar age and gender characteristics. The MTHFR C677T polymorphism genotypes were determined by a polymerase chain reaction and a subsequent restriction analysis with HinfI. The genotypes of C(677)T methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene polymorphism were determined in a sample of 654 Caucasian (Czech) subjects. We proved a significant difference in genotype distribution (P(g) = 0.03) and allelic frequency (P(a) = 0.02) between psoriatic and control subjects (Table 3). The CC (the thermostabile) genotype was significantly more frequent in psoriatic patients compared to controls [OR = 1.55, 95% confidential interval (CI) = 1.12-2.15, P = 0.004814, P(corr) = 0.01]. But, a significant increase of T allele in MTHFR gene was observed in patients with positive family history of diabetes (P(a) = 0.02) and in those with a frequent tonsillitis/tonsillectomy (P(a) = 0.04). No difference was observed between patients with and without positive family history of psoriasis (P(a) = 0.251). But, when psoriatic patients were described for FHDM, FH-Ps, and PH-T simultaneously, The highest incidence of CT + TT genotypes was calculated for psoriasis patients with positive history of psoriasis and diabetes mellitus together with personal history of repeated tonsillitis/tonsillectomy compared to patients without all these three phenotypes (odds ratio = 3.17, 95% CI 1.33-7.56, P(corr) = 0.04). In conclusion, MTHFR C677T polymorphism is marginally associated with psoriasis. The T allele (thermolabile) appears to be more frequent in psoriasis patients with positive history of psoriasis and diabetes mellitus together with personal history of repeated tonsillitis/tonsillectomy. This could reflect an inborn predisposition in complex regulation in one-carbon moieties transport in psoriatic patients and therefore, MTHFR genotype can be a part of genetic background of psoriasis.

TI	Lack of association between interleukin-6 promoter polymorphism at position -174 and Henoch-Schonlein pur pura.
PG	S6-9
AB	OBJECTIVE: To assess whether polymorphism of the interleukin (IL)-6 gene at the position -174 was implicated in the incidence of Henoch-Schonlein pur-pura (HSP). A further objective was to determine if any relationship existed with severe systemic complications of HSP, in particular with severe renal and gastrointestinal involvement. METHODS: Unselected patients from Northwest Spain with primary cutaneous vasculitis classified as HSP according to proposed criteria were studied. All patients included in the present study were required to have had at least 2 year's follow-up. Patients and controls were genotyped for a single biallelic (G/C) nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter region at the position -174 of the IL-6 gene by a polymerase reaction chain-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. RESULTS: Forty-six Caucasian HSP patients and 124 healthy matched controls were studied. No allele or genotype differences between the whole group of HSP and controls were observed. This was also the case when HSP patients were stratified by the presence of gastrointestinal complications, nephritis, and permanent renal involvement (renal sequelae). CONCLUSION: The polymorphism in IL-6 gene promoter (-174 G/C) does not appear to be a genetic risk factor for HSP in Northwest Spain.

TI	Association between systemic lupus erythematosus and insertion/deletion polymorphism of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene.
PG	593-6
AB	OBJECTIVE: ACE takes part in the renin-angiotensin and kallikrein-kininogen systems by creating angiotensin-II and inactivating bradykinin. ACE gene insertion/deletion polymorphism is associated with the level of circulating enzymes--subjects with the DD genotype have higher levels of circulating ACE than subjects with the II genotype and show an increased tendency towards impaired vascular function and structure. Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) suffer from differentially expressed vascular pathology. We attempted to determine whether the type of ACE polymorphism could contribute to this pathology. METHODS: 101 SLE patients fulfilling the ACR criteria were investigated. The I/D polymorphism was ascertained by PCR, followed by electrophoresis of the amplified fragments and UV visualization. RESULTS: The frequency of the D allele was higher in the SLE group (0.623) than in the controls (0.520) (chi 2 test, p &lt; 0.025). The distribution of the ACE genotype in SLE group was different from that in the control group (p &lt; 0.05). An association between the DD genotype and visceral damage (p &lt; 0.006) was observed. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that in the multifactorially determined vascular pathology of SLE, changes associated with I/D polymorphism could influence vessel wall inflammation (monocyte adhesion and activation with cytokine release, T-lymphocyte metabolism), a tendency towards vascular impairment (neointimal proliferation, vasospasm, platelet activation, myocyte proliferation) and lead to the subsequent ischemia. The ACE gene could serve as the visceral damage indicator in SLE.

TI	Silver-Russell patients showing a broad range of ICR1 and ICR2 hypomethylation in different tissues.
PG	83-8
LID	10.1111/j.1399-0004.2010.01514.x [doi]
AB	In all known congenital imprinting disorders an association with aberrant methylation or mutations at specific loci was well established. However, several patients with transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM), Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) exhibiting multilocus hypomethylation (MLH) have meanwhile been described. Whereas TNDM patients with MLH show clinical symptoms different from carriers with isolated 6q24 aberrations, MLH carriers diagnosed as BWS or SRS present only the syndrome-specific features. Interestingly, SRS and BWS patients with nearly identical MLH patterns in leukocytes have been identified. We now report on the molecular findings in DNA in three SRS patients with hypomethylation of both 11p15 imprinted control regions (ICRs) in leukocytes. One patient was a monozygotic (MZ) twin, another was a triplet. While the hypomethylation affected both oppositely imprinted 11p15 ICRs in leukocytes, in buccal swab DNA only the ICR1 hypomethylation was visible in two of our patients. In the non-affected MZ twin of one of these patients, aberrant methylation was also present in leukocytes but neither in buccal swab DNA nor in skin fibroblasts. Despite mutation screening of several factors involved in establishment and maintenance of methylation marks including ZFP57, MBD3, DNMT1 and DNMT3L the molecular clue for the ICR1/ICR2 hypomethylation in our patients remained unclear. Furthermore, the reason for the development of the specific SRS phenotype is not obvious. In conclusion, our data reflect the broad range of epimutations in SRS and illustrate that an extensive molecular and clinical characterization of patients is necessary.

Nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) essential modulator (NEMO) that is required for the activation of NF-kappaB plays an important role in inflammation. To investigate the role of NEMO in the pathogenesis of Behcet's disease, we analyzed NEMO gene and its expression pattern in tissues in a family with Behcet's disease. We found a heterozygous mutation (1217A&gt; T, D406V) in a 6-year-old girl and her mother. Skewed X-chromosome inactivation was not observed in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells as well as in oral and intestinal mucosa of the patients. Accordingly, there was a significant proportion of peripheral blood monocytes that did not produce sufficient intracellular tumor necrosis factor-alpha with the stimulation of lipopolysaccharide. Heterozygous NEMO mutation is a cause of familial occurrence of Behcet's disease in female patients.

TI	Epimutation at human chromosome 14q32.2 in a boy with a upd(14)mat-like clinical phenotype.
PG	251-8
AB	Recently, three reports described deletions and epimutations affecting the imprinted region at chromosome 14q32.2 in individuals with a phenotype typical for maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 14 [upd(14)mat]. In this study, we describe another patient with upd(14)mat-like phenotype including low birth weight, neonatal feeding problems, muscular hypotonia, motor and developmental delay, small hands and feet, and truncal obesity. Conventional cytogenetic analyses, fluorescence in situ hybridization subtelomere screening, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis of common microdeletion and microduplication syndromes, and methylation analysis of SNRPN all gave normal results. Methylation analysis at 14q32.2 revealed a gross hypomethylation of the differentially methylated regions (intergenic DMR and MEG3-DMR). Further molecular studies excluded full or segmental upd(14)mat as well as a microdeletion within this region. Evidently, the upd(14)mat-like clinical phenotype is caused by an epimutation at 14q32.2. The clinical and molecular features of this novel case are discussed with respect to the recently published cases.

TI	Hepatic lipase promoter C-480T polymorphism is associated with serum lipids levels, but not subclinical atherosclerosis: the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study.
PG	46-53
AB	The common C-480T polymorphism (rs1800588) of the hepatic lipase gene (LIPC) has been associated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, atherosclerosis, and coronary artery disease. In this study, we examined whether the polymorphism is associated with serum lipid and lipoprotein concentrations, as well as with subclinical atherosclerosis in Young Finns. The participants comprised 2041 men and women (aged 24-39 years) enrolled in the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study with complete data concerning the rs1800588 polymorphism and serum lipids concentration. All participants underwent an ultrasound examination for brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD) and carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) measurement. The marker of arterial elasticity, carotid artery compliance (CAC), was also calculated by means of ultrasound and concomitant brachial blood pressure measurements. In all subjects, serum total cholesterol (p &lt; 0.001), HDL cholesterol (p = 0.006), apolipoprotein AI (apoAI, p &lt; 0.001), and triglyceride (p = 0.009) concentrations increased according to rs1800588 genotype in the order CC, CT, and TT. The same order applied only to apoAI after adjustment for age, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, diabetes, hypertension, contraceptive hormone use in women, and concentrations of glucose, insulin and C-reactive protein in men and women separately (p = 0.007 and p = 0.003, respectively). The polymorphism was also associated with HDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglyceride levels in women (adjusted p = 0.004, p = 0.007 and 0.02, respectively), but not in men (p was not significant for all). No significant association between the rs1800588 and brachial FMD, carotid IMT, or CAC was found among the entire study population or among women or men separately, with or without adjustment for the above-mentioned factors. The rs1800588 is associated with serum lipid and apolipoprotein concentrations, especially in women, but does not seem to be a determinant of brachial artery FMD, carotid IMT, or CAC in young healthy adults.

TI	Non-random maternal X-chromosome inactivation associated with PHACES.
PG	345-50
AB	The acronym PHACES is used to describe the association of posterior fossa malformations, hemangiomas, arterial anomalies (cardiovascular or cerebrovascular), coarctation of the aorta and cardiac defects, eye abnormalities, and sternal or ventral defects. We report a female patient with an uncommon variant of this neurocutaneous disorder who manifested a sternal cleft; supraumbilical raphe; hemangiomas of the face, chest, and extremities; micrognathia and cerebrovascular anomalies. A literature review of PHACES patients with both sternal cleft and supraumbilical raphe showed a marked female predilection. Taken together with cases of sternal cleft, supraumbilical raphe and facial hemangiomas tabulated by Gorlin et al. (1994), 91% (40/44) of patients are female. One affected male died shortly after birth. We hypothesized that the gender bias in PHACES results from mutation in an X-linked dominant gene often lethal in males, and performed X-inactivation analysis of the polymorphic androgen receptor locus in this family. We documented consistently skewed X-inactivation (80%/20% in two independent analyses) in the unaffected mother and consistently random X-inactivation (47:53 and 61:39 in independent analyses) in the proband. These findings are consistent with favorably skewed X-inactivation producing a normal maternal phenotype, a phenomenon documented in X-linked dominant Rett syndrome.

TI	Maternal mutation 677C &gt; T in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene associated with severe brain injury in offspring.
PG	69-80
AB	A frequent polymorphism in the gene coding for 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase is the substitution 677C &gt; T which produces a thermolabile and inefficient enzyme. Homozygosity for the 677C &gt; T allele is the most important determinant of hyperhomocys-teinemia, when folic acid intake is reduced. Most studies on the relationship between the 677C &gt; T variant in the mother and defects in the offspring have focused on neural-tube defects. This study is a retrospective case-control investigation of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy of the newborn (HIEN) with reference to the 677C &gt; T polymorphism as a genetic risk for this condition. The prevalence of the 677C &gt; T allele was studied in 11 children with HIEN, their respective mothers, and 85 healthy individuals. Plasma homocysteine levels after fasting and methionine loading were determined in both mothers and controls. Ten of 11 patients were evaluated using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and all showed multicystic encephalomalacia and severe brain vasculopathy. Seven mothers were homozygous and four heterozygous for the 677C &gt; T allele. Five of the children were homozygous and six heterozygous for this polymorphism. The variant allele frequency was higher in the group of mothers with affected children than in the controls and was associated with an increase in plasma homocysteine after methionine loading, in the group of mothers than in controls. The 677C &gt; T mutation in mothers, either in a homozygous or heterozygous state, together with poor nutritional status (probable folate deficiency) may represent a risk factor for irreversible HIEN in the offspring.

TI	Prader-Willi syndrome resulting from an unbalanced translocation: characterization by array comparative genomic hybridization.
PG	477-82
AB	Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is caused by lack of expression of paternally inherited genes on chromosome 15q11--&gt;15q13. Most cases result from microdeletions in proximal chromosome 15q. The remainder results from maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 15, imprinting center defects, and rarely from balanced or unbalanced chromosome rearrangements involving chromosome 15. We report a patient with multiple congenital anomalies, including craniofacial dysmorphology, microcephaly, bilateral cryptorchidism, and developmental delay. Cytogenetic analysis showed a de novo 45,XY,der(5)t(5;15)(p15.2;q13), -15 karyotype. In effect, the proband had monosomies of 5p15.2--&gt;pter and 15pter--&gt;15q13. Methylation polymerase chain reaction analysis of the promoter region of the SNRPN gene showed only the maternal allele, consistent with the PWS phenotype. The proband's expanded phenotype was similar to other patients who have PWS as a result of unbalanced translocations and likely reflects the contribution of the associated monosomy. Array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) confirmed deletions of both distal 5p and proximal 15q and provided more accurate information as to the size of the deletions and the molecular breakpoints. This case illustrates the utility of array CGH in characterizing complex constitutional structural chromosome abnormalities at the molecular level.

TI	A study of the influence of different genotypes on the physical and behavioral phenotypes of children and adults ascertained clinically as having PWS.
PG	273-81
AB	A population-based cohort of people with a clinical diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) was genetically assessed using molecular diagnostic methods and subsequently divided into the following genetic subtypes involving chromosome 15: 'deletion', 'disomy' and genetically negative (referred to as 'PWS-like'). The physical and behavioral characteristics of the three groups were compared in order to evaluate the unique characteristics of the phenotype resulting from loss of expression of imprinted genes at 15q11q13 (PWS vs. PWS-like cases), the possible effect of either haploid insufficiency of non-imprinted genes (deletion cases), or gain of function of imprinted genes (disomy cases) located within the PWS critical region at 15q11q13. In this study, the main differences between probands with either a deletion or disomy are considered, and the possible involvement of contributing genes discussed. The differences within the PWS group proved difficult to quantify. It would appear that haploid insufficiency or gain of function are more subtle contributors than gender-specific genomic imprinting in the production of the PWS phenotype.

TI	Association between G-308A polymorphism of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure values in type 1 diabetic adolescents.
PG	474-7
AB	Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is an inflammatory cytokine, which also influences blood pressure (BP). The G-308A polymorphism of the TNF-alpha gene is associated with altered TNF-alpha production. The prevalence of the TNF-alpha-308A allele is reportedly higher among patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) than in the healthy population. In this study we investigated whether this genetic polymorphism might correlate with BP values in diabetic adolescents. Ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) was performed in 126 adolescents with T1DM (mean age: 14 +/	2.4 years). The TNF-alpha G-308A genotype was determined by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) methodologies. ABPM results were related to healthy reference values and are given as standard deviation score (SDS). The prevalence of the -308A allele was higher in diabetic adolescents than the Hungarian reference population (0.26 vs 0.14, p &lt; 0.01). TNF-alpha genotype was associated both with systolic and diastolic BP values (p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.01, respectively). In patients with TNF-alpha-308GG and -308GA/AA genotypes, the 24-h systolic BP average values were 0.37 +/	1.33 and -0.38 +/	1.28 SDS, while 24-h diastolic BP average values were 0.09 +/	1.30 and -0.67 +/	1.31 SDS. Hence, the TNF-alpha-308A allele carrier state appears to be associated with lower systolic and diastolic BP values.

TI	The LPL S447X cSNP is associated with decreased blood pressure and plasma triglycerides, and reduced risk of coronary artery disease.
PG	293-300
AB	Linkage of the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene to blood pressure levels has been reported. The LPL S447X single nucleotide polymorphism (cSNP) has been associated with decreased triglycerides (TG), increased high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and a decreased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), which may occur independently of its beneficial lipid changes. To investigate the relationship between LPL S447X cSNP and these parameters, we studied a cohort of individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia in whom blood pressures and information regarding the use of blood pressure lowering medications were available. Carriers of the S447X variant had decreased TG (1.21+/-0.47 vs. 1.52+/-0.67, p&lt;0.001) and a trend towards decreased vascular disease (12.7 vs. 19.5%) compared to non-carriers. More interestingly, however, carriers of this cSNP had decreased diastolic blood pressure compared to non-carriers (78+/-10 vs. 82+/-11, p=0.002), evident in both men and women, youths and adults, with similar trends for systolic blood pressure. Furthermore, the decrease in blood pressure appeared independent of the decrease in TG (p=0.02), suggesting that the LPL protein may have a direct influence on the vascular wall. This suggests an additional mechanism whereby this variant may have protective effects, independent of changes in plasma lipid levels.

TI	Familial Prader-Willi syndrome: case report and a literature review.
PG	216-23
AB	Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a neurobehavioural disorder arising through a number of different genetic mechanisms. All involve loss of paternal gene expression from chromosome 15q11q13. Although the majority of cases of PWS are sporadic, precise elucidation of the causative genetic mechanism is essential for accurate genetic counselling as the recurrence risk varies according to the mechanism involved. A pair of siblings affected by PWS is described. Neither demonstrates a microscopically visible deletion in 15q11q13 or maternal disomy. Methylation studies at D15S63 and at the SNRPN locus confirm the diagnosis of PWS. Molecular studies reveal biparental inheritance in both siblings with the exception of D15S128 and D15S63 where no paternal contribution is present indicating a deletion of the imprinting centre. Family studies indicate that the father of the siblings carries the deletion which, he has inherited from his mother. The recurrence risk for PWS in his offspring is 50%.

TI	Imprinting centre deletions in two PWS families: implications for diagnostic testing and genetic counseling.
PG	284-90
AB	Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex genetic syndrome involving imprinted genes on chromosome 15. It is usually sporadic, and very few affected siblings have been described. Here, we report the clinical and molecular findings in two families with a microdeletion affecting the chromosome 15 imprinting centre (IC). Carrier males have a 50% risk of having children with an imprinting defect leading to PWS, and in one of the two families, a father has two affected daughters. In the other family, diagnostic testing was confounded by the presence of a neutral microdeletion close to the IC. The silent transmission of PWS IC deletions through the female germline and the occurrence of neutral microdeletions close to the IC can impose considerable problems on diagnostic testing and genetic counselling in affected families.

TI	A common truncation variant of lipoprotein lipase (Ser447X) confers protection against coronary heart disease: the Framingham Offspring Study.
PG	450-4
AB	Genetic variation at the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) locus has been shown to influence plasma lipids and to modulate risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Recently, we found that the most frequent variant at this locus, involving a C-terminal truncation of two amino acids (Ser447X), was associated with both higher LPL activity and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in patients with CHD. However, the impact of this S447X variant on lipids and CHD in the general population was hitherto unknown. We, therefore, analyzed a total of 1114 men and 1144 women randomly ascertained from the Framingham Offspring Study (FOS) for the presence of this LPL variant. Carrier frequency of the S447X allele was 17%, and in men carrier status was associated with higher total cholesterol (delta = 6.2 mg/dl, p = 0.03). higher HDL-C (delta = 2.3 mg/dl, p = 0.01), and lower triglyceride (TG) levels (delta = -19.4 mg/dl, p = 0.02). Moreover, in men, the S447X allele conferred significant protection against CHD (odds ratio: 0.43; p = 0.04). These effects on lipids and CHD were not seen in women. Our study represents the first report on the impact of this mutation on CHD in men from the general population, and we conclude, therefore, that the S447X variant may confer significant protection against high TG levels, low HDL-C, and premature CHD in these subjects.

TI	Unusual clinical features in an Angelman syndrome patient with uniparental disomy due to a translocation 15q15q.
PG	303-8
AB	We had previously described a patient with an overgrowth syndrome and the chromosome constitution 45,XY,t(15q15q) (Wajntal et al., DNA Cell Biol 1993: 12: 227-231). Clinical reassessment and the use of molecular studies, including methylation analysis with an SNRPN probe, microsatellite analyses of D15S11, GABRB3 and D15S113 loci, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using the SNRPN and GABRB3 probes, are consistent with a diagnosis of Angelman syndrome (AS) due to paternal isodisomy. This is the fourth report case of a translocation 15q15q with paternal uniparental disomy (UPD). Our findings suggest that some patients with clinical features of AS have hyperphagia and obesity with overgrowth, and that these features should not rule out a diagnosis of AS.

TI	A case of Prader-Willi syndrome arising as a result of familial unbalanced translocation t(11;15)(q25;q13).
PG	60-4
AB	We report on a case of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) with a true reciprocal unbalanced translocation, 45,XX,-15,der(11)t(11;15)pat. The proposita was diagnosed clinically as having severe PWS. Molecular studies revealed loss of the paternal methylation pattern at locus D15S63 and a deletion encompassing the loci from at least D15S10 to D15S97 of paternal chromosome 15. FISH studies confirmed the deletion of 15q11q13 region and the presence of two telomeres on all chromosomes. The proposita's father, the father's sister and their mother are all carriers of the same balanced translocation t(11;15)(q25;q13). By genomic imprinting we would expect that if the father's sister were to give birth to a child with the same unbalanced translocation as the proband, it would be affected by Angelman syndrome. To date, a similar familial unbalanced translocation due to loss of the small chromosome15 derivative has not been described.

TI	Restriction fragment length polymorphisms at the apoprotein genes AI, CIII and B-100 and in the 5' flanking region of the insulin gene as possible markers of coronary heart disease.
PG	184-90
AB	Several sequence variations were examined for being endogenous &quot;risk markers&quot; in the development of CHD. The &quot;markers&quot; in this study included: the PstI-SstI RFLPs in the apo AI-CIII gene cluster, the EcoRI-MspI RFLPs in the apo B100 gene and the SstI RFLP in the 5' flanking region of the insulin gene. The study population comprised 700 individuals of German origin. A strong association of these &quot;markers&quot; to the disease phenotype predicts their loss in healthy individuals with ages above that of the prevalent incidence of CHD. In contrast, these &quot;markers&quot; should accumulate in diseased persons. A significant age-dependent selection was observed for the EcoRI RFLP in the apo B100 gene. This was the case when the allele and genotype frequencies of healthy old individuals were compared with those of newborns. In contrast, no RFLP showed significant differences in allele and genotype distributions between patients defined by coronary angiography and controls. In the group of patients, but not controls, several RFLP genotypes were found to be associated with significantly higher serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. This was true in the case of serum cholesterol comparing the genotypes S1S2 with those of S1S1 (p = 0.05) observed for the SstI polymorphic site in the 3' noncoding region of the apo CIII gene. Significantly higher levels of triglycerides were found within the heterozygous patients P1P2 (p = 0.045) and S1S2 (p = 0.02) than in the homozygotes P1P1 and S1S1 for the PstI-SstI RFLPs at the apo AI-CIII gene cluster.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI	Variability gene effects of DNA polymorphisms at the apo B, apo A I/C III and apo E loci on serum lipids: the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study.
PG	113-21
AB	We studied the influence of selected genetic markers on the intra-individual long-term variability in serum lipid levels. The study cohort consisted of a sub-sample from a large follow-up study of atherosclerosis precursors in children and young adults. A total of 320 subjects had determinations of apo B XbaI RFLP genotypes, 305 subjects had apo AI/CIII SstI RFLP genotype determinations and 1581 subjects had their apo E phenotypes determined. Complete data on serum lipids were available at 3-year intervals over a 6-year follow-up period. The subjects were healthy and aged 3-18 years at baseline. Intra-individual variability was assessed with a nested analysis of variance procedure. Each of the genetic markers studied here significantly affected intra-individual variability of serum lipid levels. No clear sex influence was observed, although the differences in variability tended to be more significant in males. Apo B XbaI genotypes significantly influenced intra-individual variability of total and LDL-cholesterol levels in both sexes. A marked effect of the XbaI genotype was also found on triglyceride variability. In males the standardized intra-individual triglyceride variances were 0.71 and 0.34 in genotypes X1X1 and X2X2, respectively (p &lt; 0.001), with a clear gene dosage effect. The apo AI/CIII genotype had an influence only on the variability of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels and only in males. The apo E phenotypes were associated with intra-individual variability in total and LDL-cholesterol levels but again, only in males.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI	XbaI polymorphism of the apolipoprotein B gene and plasma lipid and lipoprotein response to dietary fat and cholesterol: a clinical trial.
PG	223-31
AB	A dietary trial was carried out on a group of offspring whose parents were hospitalized for an acute myocardial infarction. The XbaI Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) was used to examine the genetic contribution of variation at this apo B locus to the response of lipids and lipoproteins to dietary manipulations. Twenty participants were homozygotes for the 8.0 kb fragment (X1X1), two were homozygotes for the 5.0 kb fragment (X2X2), and 15 were heterozygotes (X1X2). Subjects were randomized to a 5-week crossover study. Half began on a low SFA--cholesterol (LSC) diet for 5 weeks and, after a washout period of 4 weeks, they were placed on a high SFA--cholesterol (HSC) diet for a second period of 5 weeks. This order was reversed in the second group of participants. Significant changes in total cholesterol, LDL-C, and apo B were observed when subjects were moved from the LSC to the HSF diet. The corresponding average change induced by the dietary manipulations in X1X1 subjects compared with subjects with X2 allele were: 18.1 +/	17.6 mg/dl and 9.5 +/	19.6 mg/dl for total cholesterol and 15.8 +/	15.3 mg/dl and 4.8 +/	20.9 mg/dl for LDL-C, respectively. Our observation indicated that variation at the apo B XbaI locus may interact with baseline levels to determine individual dietary response in LDL-C level. However, the differences between the genotypic classes were not statistically significant, suggesting that the apo B XbaI locus is not a major determinant of interindividual differences in lipid and lipoprotein response to diet in this population.

TI	Partial trisomy 8q. Two case reports with maternal translocation and inverted insertion: phenotype analyses and reflections on the risk.
PG	178-85
AB	Partial trisomy 8qter--&gt;q23 or q24.1 has been reported in 15 literature cases. We add two further case reports here. Patient 1 inherited the derivative (2) of a balanced maternal reciprocal translocation t(2;8)(qter;q2300) after 2:2 disjunction and adjacent-1 segregation, and is trisomic for the segment 8qter--&gt;q2300. Patient 2 inherited a recombinant (8) of a balanced maternal inverted insertion inv ins(8)(q1300;q2300q24.2) and is trisomic for the segment 8q24.2--&gt;q2300. The phenotype of both patients is described and compared to the spectrum of symptoms established from the 15 literature cases. This spectrum contains all features observed with a frequency of &gt; = 50%. Patient 1 had 35% of the features of this spectrum; Patient 2 had 47%. The intrauterine survival probability of unbalanced offspring is assumed to be the same in both cases, as nearly the same segments are trisomic. The pedigrees indicate that the inversion carrier may have a reduced production probability of unbalanced gametes and therefore a reduced risk compared to the translocation carrier.

TI	Association of alleles at polymorphic sites in the Osteopontin encoding gene in young type 1 diabetic patients.
PG	84-91
AB	The Osteopontin (OPN) encoding gene, SPP1, can be considered as a candidate for genetic susceptibility to type 1 diabetes (T1D) because of its known function in immune response and inflammation. This work aimed to evaluate the role of SPP1 gene in susceptibility to T1D. Patients (238: 130 male, 108 female) and unaffected adult control individuals (137: 68 males and 69 females) have been genotyped for three variants in the SPP1 gene: -156 (G/GG) and -66 (T/G) in the promoter and a biallelic ins/del variant (TG/TGTG) at +245 in the first intron. The G allele at the -66 SNP had significantly higher frequency in controls than T1D patients. Interestingly, case-control comparison in males showed no significant association, whereas the association was confirmed in females. These results suggest that SPP1 can play a role as susceptibility gene, possibly by a sex-specific mechanism acting in the autoimmune process.

TI	Hypersomnia in the Prader Willi syndrome: clinical-electrophysiological features and underlying factors.
PG	800-5
AB	OBJECTIVE: Excessive daytime sleepiness is a common symptom in Prader Willi syndrome (PWs). Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and narcoleptic traits such as REM sleep onsets (SOREMPs) have been reported in these subjects. We evaluated nighttime and daytime sleep patterns in patients with PWs in order to clarify the nature of their hypersomnia. DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed overnight continuous EEG-polysomnographic studies (with breathing monitoring included) in 14 subjects (6 M,8 F; mean age 17 years, range 8-37) affected by PWs unselected for sleep disturbances. Ten patients underwent a Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) the day following the nocturnal sleep studies. Patients assessment was completed by means of immunogenetic characterization. RESULTS: Nocturnal polysomnographic investigation documented sleep related breathing abnormalities such as central apneas, hypopneas or hypoventilation which mainly occurred during REM sleep in 8 subjects and did not cause sleep disruption. Only 4 subjects presented an increase in the Respiratory Disorder Index (RDI) slightly above the normal limits. In 8 subjects out of 10, with and without SDB, the mean daytime sleep latency could be considered abnormal according to the Tanner staging of pubertal development. Five patients showed at least two SOREMPs at MSLT. Subjects with and without SOREMPs had, respectively, a mean age of 18.6 SD 7.9 (4 M, 1 F) and 14.5 SD 2.9 (4 F, 1 M). The paternal deletion:uniparental dysomy ratio at genotypic characterization was 4:1 and 3.5:1 in subjects with and without SOREMPs, respectively. No patient presented DR-15 nor Dq-6. CONCLUSIONS: Excessive sleepiness is a frequent disturbance in PWs. Subgroups of PW patients show hypersomnolence and SOREMPs. Sleep disordered breathing appears to have a limited role in the genesis of hypersomnia which not seems on the other hand attributable to the coexistence of narcolepsy phenotype. Hypersomnia in PW syndrome is likely to mainly be attributable to a primary hypothalamic dysfunction. The potential interacting role of other factors such as subjects age, sex and genetic pattern is suggested and deserve further investigation.

TI	Arg16 homozygosity of the beta2-adrenergic receptor improves the outcome after beta2-agonist tocolysis for preterm labor.
PG	656-63
AB	BACKGROUND: Beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (beta(2)AR) agonists are not consistently successful when administered as tocolytic therapy. The beta(2)AR displays genetic variability; an arginine-to-glycine substitution at codon 16 (Arg16Gly) has been shown to increase receptor desensitization in response to agonist exposure, whereas a substitution of glutamate for glutamine at codon 27 (Gln27Glu) decreases down-regulation. We have demonstrated that homozygosity for Arg16 protects against preterm delivery. Our goal was to determine whether beta(2)-agonists are more effective in women with the Arg16 genotype and preterm labor. METHODS: Sixty white women with preterm labor between 24 and 34 weeks' gestation were treated for 48 hours with intravenous hexoprenaline. The effect of tocolysis and outcome of pregnancy were recorded. The beta(2)AR genotypes at codons 16 and 27 of ADRB2 were determined. A control group of 116 women delivered at term was also genotyped. RESULTS: Preterm labor was not associated with beta(2)AR genotype at codon 16 (17% of patients with preterm labor were Arg16 homozygotes versus 19% of control subjects) or codon 27. Gestation was significantly prolonged in Arg16 homozygotes (median, 69 days; interquartile range, 63-79 days) compared with the other 2 genotypes (median, 58 days; interquartile range, 2-72 days) (P = .04). Tocolysis was 100% successful in delaying delivery for 48 hours in Arg16 homozygotes (n = 10), just failing to achieve statistical significance (P = .069). In contrast, only 37 of 50 women carrying 1 or 2 glycine alleles (74%) had delivery delayed by more than 48 hours with tocolysis. Neonatal outcomes were significantly better in babies born to mothers homozygous for arginine than in women with 1 or 2 Gly16 alleles. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study examining the pharmacogenetics of beta(2)AR agonist therapy for preterm labor. It appears that Arg16 homozygosity improves pregnancy outcome after beta(2)-agonist tocolysis. The relatively low frequency of Arg16 homozygotes in our population limited the power of this investigation. Future assessments of tocolytic therapy may need to assess beta(2)AR genotype.

TI	Renin-angiotensin system gene polymorphisms: association with susceptibility to Henoch-Schonlein purpura and renal involvement.
PG	861-5
AB	The clinical course of Henoch-Schonlein Purpura (HSP) in children is variable, with some patients having a much more rapidly progressing course than others. We investigated whether polymorphisms of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) genes are involved in HSP. Three RAS genotypes were examined in 114 children with HSP and in 164 healthy children: the angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion polymorphism, the M235T mutation in the angiotensinogen gene (Agt), and the A1166C in the angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R) gene. Significant differences were observed between HSP patients and control group in the frequency of ACE and Agt genotypes (p=0.004 and p=0.003, respectively). The TT genotype of Agt gene was associated with a 3.5-fold increased risk for Henoch-Schonlein nephritis (HSN) compared with the MM/MT genotype (odds ratio, 3.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-10.4). There was a trend to a higher prevalence of the TT genotype of the Agt gene among patients with nephrotic range proteinuria when compared to the patients with mild proteinuria, although the difference did not reach a statistical significance. The results of this study suggest that polymorphisms of ACE gene and Agt gene likely influence the risk of developing HSP. However, among the three genes of the RAS studies, only Agt gene was associated with the susceptibility to HSN. RAS gene polymorphisms studied are not associated with the presence of nephrotic range proteinuria. Additional studies are warranted to verify the correlation between RAS gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to HSP.

TI	Association of TCF7L2 allelic variations with gastric function, satiation, and GLP-1 levels.
PG	183-7
LID	10.1111/j.1752-8062.2011.00284.x [doi]
AB	OBJECTIVE: Genetic variation in transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2), a regulator of proglucagon processing, is reproducibly associated with type 2 diabetes. GLP-1 alters gastric function and increases satiation. HYPOTHESIS: Genetic variation in TCF7L2 is associated with satiation, gastric motor function, and GLP-1 concentrations. METHODS: In 62 adults, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of TCF7L2 (rs7903146) was genotyped and associations with gastric emptying (GE) of solids and liquids, gastric volume (GV), and satiation (maximum tolerated volume and symptoms after nutrient drink test) were explored using a dominant genetic model, with gender and BMI as covariates. In 50 of the participants, we also measured plasma GLP-1 during fasting and after ingestion of a nutrient drink. RESULTS: Presence of the T allele compared to CC genotype in rs7903146 SNP of the TCF7L2 gene was associated with reduced fasting GV (246.3 +/	11.4 mL for CC group, compared to 215.7 +/	11.4 mL for CT/TT group, p= 0.05) and accelerated GE t(1/2) of liquids (26.3 +/	2.0 minutes for CC compared to 17.7 +/	1.4 for CT/TT, p &lt; 0.005). There was no significant association of rs7903146 SNP with GE of solids, gastric accommodation, satiation, fasting, or postprandial GLP-1. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest TCF7L2 is associated with altered gastric functions that may predispose to obesity.

TI	Congenital cardiovascular disease in Turner syndrome.
PG	2-15
AB	Turner syndrome (TS), or monosomy X, occurs in approximately 1/2000 live born females. Intelligence is normal and short stature is the most obvious and consistent feature of the syndrome. Congenital cardiovascular disease affects approximately 50% of individuals and is the major cause of premature mortality in adults. Unfortunately, this most important aspect of the syndrome has received little attention outside of pediatric medicine, and adult cardiological follow-up is seriously lacking. This review describes the spectrum of cardiovascular defects with particular attention to identifying risk factors for aortic dissection/rupture. X-chromosome genetic pathways implicated in Turner cardiovascular disease, including premature coronary artery disease, are discussed. Recent guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of girls and women with TS are reviewed.

TI	Developmental mechanisms involved in the primary prevention of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.
PG	170-5
AB	The common belief that signs of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are clinically relevant only during adult and elderly age is gradually changing. Increasing evidence supports the concept that CVD is initiated through developmental in utero processes beginning before birth. Epigenetic and other unknown mechanisms underlying these developmental events are yet to be elucidated. The clinical implications of such theories for the primary prevention of CVD are intuitive and logical, but clinical prospective studies and translational approaches are still warranted. The evolution of CVD is usually characterized by a long lag time between onset and clinical manifestation, thereby providing a relevant opportunity for its early non-invasive detection during childhood and tailored therapeutic strategies, both with established pharmacologic agents and newly developed drugs that can affect epigenetic mechanisms.

TI	Investigating parent of origin effects in studies of type 2 diabetes and obesity.
PG	329-39
AB	The role of parent-of-origin effects (POE) in the etiology of complex diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and obesity is currently of intense interest, but still largely unclear. POE are transmittable genetic effects whereby the expression of the phenotype in the offspring depends upon whether the transmission originated from the mother or father. In mammals, POE can be caused by genetic imprinting, intrauterine effects, or maternally inherited mitochondrial genes. In this paper, we describe the different mechanisms underlying POE, characterize known examples of POE in rare forms of diabetes, and review the evidence from linkage and association studies for POE in T2DM and obesity. Finally, we summarize some of the new and established statistical and experimental approaches commonly used to detect POE. Through this paper, we hope emphasizes the potentially significant importance of POE in the etiology of T2DM and obesity.

TI	Epigenetics and hypertension.
PG	21-8
AB	Epigenetics refers to mechanisms for environment-gene interactions (mainly by methylation of DNA and modification of histones) that do not alter the underlying base sequence of the gene. This article reviews evidence for epigenetic contributions to hypertension. For example, DNA methylation at CpG islands and histone acetylation pathways are known to limit nephron development, thereby unmasking hypertension associated with exposure to a high-salt diet. Maternal water deprivation and protein deficiency are shown to increase expression of renin-angiotensin system genes in the offspring. The methylation pattern of a serine protease inhibitor gene in human placentas is shown to be a marker for preeclampsia-associated hypertension. Mental stress induces phenylethanolamine n-methyltransferase, which may act as a DNA methylase and mimic the gene-silencing effects of methyl CpG binding protein-2 on the norepinephrine transporter gene, which, in turn, may exaggerate autonomic responsiveness. A disrupter of telomeric silencing (Dot1) is known to modulate the expression of a connective-tissue growth-factor gene associated with blood vessel remodeling, which could alter vascular compliance and elastance. Dot1a also interacts with the Af9 gene to produce high sodium channel permeability and silences the hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-11beta2 gene, thereby preventing metabolism of cortisol to cortisone and overstimulating aldosterone receptors. These findings indicate targets for environment-gene interactions in various hypertensive states and in essential hypertension.

TI	Epigenetic regulation of metabolism in children born small for gestational age.
PG	482-8
AB	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Epigenetic alterations are responsible for modulation of tissue-specific gene expression and genomic imprinting. Mechanisms include posttranslational modifications of core histones and DNA methylation. The review focuses on emerging data highlighting the potential for epigenetic modulation of gene expression in mediating early-life programming of increased risk of adult-onset disease. To illustrate these concepts, we focus on epigenetic programming of insulin resistance, obesity and type 2 diabetes, with emphasis on the potential role of the adipocyte and three of its products, fatty acids, leptin and tumour necrosis factor alpha. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have highlighted potential mechanisms underlying epigenetic modification of tissue function that may predispose to later development of insulin resistance. These include altered regulation of adipocyte clonal expansion and terminal differentiation via epigenetic modification of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, Foxo1 or cyclin D1 expression and signalling that, via altered adipocyte lipid sequestration, alters lipid delivery to nonadipose tissue and, therefore, insulin action or modification of adipokine or cytokine expression and signalling. Direct epigenetic modification of insulin action in muscle may be achieved through altered stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 expression, which correlates with low fatty acid oxidation. SUMMARY: While poor early growth and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in adulthood are undisputedly linked, the relative impact of environment or genotype remains unclear. Altered DNA methylation patterns could, potentially, serve as biomarkers for assessment of prognosis and could help in the development of prophylactic strategies.

TI	Developmental origins of diabetes: the role of epigenetic mechanisms.
PG	13-6
AB	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Intrauterine growth retardation has been linked to later development of type 2 diabetes. An abnormal intrauterine milieu affects the development of the fetus by permanently modifying gene expression of susceptible cells. Altered gene expression persists after birth suggesting that an epigenetic mechanism may be responsible for changes in transcription. The purpose of this article is to review basic epigenetic mechanisms and familiarize the reader with the latest research linking epigenetics, fetal programming, and the development of type 2 diabetes. RECENT FINDINGS: Intrauterine growth retardation causes hypomethylation and hyperacetylation of genomic DNA in brain and liver of rats. These findings are associated with zinc deficiency that often accompanies fetal growth retardation. Studies in the intrauterine growth retardation rat demonstrate that an abnormal intrauterine environment induces epigenetic modifications of key genes regulating beta-cell development and experiments directly link chromatin remodeling to suppression of transcription. Dietary protein restriction of pregnant rats induces hypomethylation of the glucocorticoid receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma genes in liver of the offspring. It is postulated that these epigenetic changes result in the observed increase in expression of these genes. SUMMARY: Future research will be directed at elucidating the mechanisms underlying epigenetic modifications in offspring.

AB	Prader-Willi syndrome is a developmental disorder with distinctive dysmorphic features, specific neurobehavioral attributes, and a characteristic learning profile. Advances continue to be made in understanding the factors associated with the loss of imprinted gene expression within chromosome 15q11-q13. These advances are helping providers make certain diagnoses early and are helping scientists uncover new genetic pathways. In addition, efforts to further understand the role of recombinant growth hormone therapy in Prader-Willi syndrome and the genetic information responsible for the neurobehavioral profile are additional targets for research.

TI	Fetal origins of adult disease.
PG	158-76
AB	Dr. David Barker first popularized the concept of fetal origins of adult disease (FOAD). Since its inception, FOAD has received considerable attention. The FOAD hypothesis holds that events during early development have a profound impact on one's risk for development of future adult disease. Low birth weight, a surrogate marker of poor fetal growth and nutrition, is linked to coronary artery disease, hypertension, obesity, and insulin resistance. Clues originally arose from large 20th century, European birth registries. Today, large, diverse human cohorts and various animal models have extensively replicated these original observations. This review focuses on the pathogenesis related to FOAD and examines Dr. David Barker's landmark studies, along with additional human and animal model data. Implications of the FOAD extend beyond the low birth weight population and include babies exposed to stress, both nutritional and nonnutritional, during different critical periods of development, which ultimately result in a disease state. By understanding FOAD, health care professionals and policy makers will make this issue a high health care priority and implement preventive measures and treatment for those at higher risk for chronic diseases.

TI	Genomic imbalances in key ion channel genes and telomere shortening in sudden cardiac death victims.
PG	350-5
AB	Sudden cardiac death (SCD) can be caused by a number of reasons. Previous works have identified the genetic causes, such as alterations in the DNA sequence, for many of these diseases. We hypothesize that some patients may show genomic imbalances and changes in the gene copy number leading to genetic instability. To clarify this, we analysed DNA samples from SCD victims using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), a molecular cytogenetic technique that permits the genome-wide screening of chromosomal imbalances, and telomere length measurement. DNA derived from peripheral blood and heart tissue of 14 SCD cases and six apparently healthy control individuals were subjected to CGH analysis. Telomere length measurements were done by the Southern blotting method. Eight out of 14 SCD cases exhibited changes in DNA/gene copy number. CGH analysis showed variation in the gene copy number of some of the genes associated with potassium (KCNAB1, KCNH2, and KCNA4) and calcium (RyR2, ATP2A2) ions which are involved in maintaining the ionic balance of the heart. Alterations in TERC and TERT genes were also detected in SCD victims. In nine SCD victims shorter telomeres were detected. This might have resulted from excessive cellular proliferation and/or oxidative stress in these individuals. Copy number changes observed and telomere shortening detected in SCD cases would possibly explain at least some of the causes of SCD at early ages in humans. Identification of biomarkers of SCD is of great importance and thus the present study will facilitate the identification of some of the biomarkers.

TI	Detection of a novel familial deletion of four genes between BP1 and BP2 of the Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome critical region by oligo-array CGH in a child with neurological disorder and speech impairment.
PG	135-40
AB	Two common classes of deletions are described in the literature in individuals with Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome (PWS/AS): one between breakpoint 1 (BP1) to BP3 and the other between BP2 to BP3 of the PWS/AS critical region on chromosome 15q11--&gt;q13. We present here a novel observation of an approximately 253-kb deletion between BP1 and BP2 on 15q11.2, in a 3(1/2)-year-old boy, who was referred to us with a clinical suspicion of having Angelman syndrome and presenting with mental retardation, neurological disorder, developmental delay and speech impairment. Karyotype and FISH results were found to be normal. The microdeletion between BP1 and BP2 includes four genes	NIPA1, NIPA2, CYFIP1 and TUBGCP5 which was detected by a high-resolution oligonucleotide array-CGH that was further validated by a Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) assay. The same deletion was observed in the father who presented with similar but relatively milder clinical features as compared to the affected son. Methylation studies by methylation-specific MLPA (MS-MLPA) of the SNRPN imprinting center (IC) showed a normal imprinting pattern, both in the patient and the father. To our knowledge a microdeletion limited only to the BP1-BP2 region has not yet been reported. The familial genetic alteration together with the striking clinical presentation in this study are interesting, but from our single case study it is difficult to suggest if the deletion is causative of some of the abnormal features or if it is a normal variant. The study however further strengthens the fact that genome-wide analysis by array CGH in individuals with developmental delay and mental retardation is very useful in detecting such hidden interstitial chromosomal rearrangements.

TI	The proportion of cells with functional X disomy is associated with the severity of mental retardation in mosaic ring X Turner syndrome females.
PG	276-84
AB	Turner syndrome females (45,X) do not have mental retardation (MR), whereas some mosaic ring X Turner syndrome females, with 45,X/46,X,r(X), have severe MR. The MR is believed to be caused by a failure of X chromosome inactivation (XCI) of the small ring X chromosome, which leads to functional X disomy (FXD), To explore this hypothesis, we examined the proportion of FXD cells in the peripheral blood of four ring X Turner syndrome females with various levels of MR, using two newly developed XCI assays based on DNA methylation of X-linked genes. As a result, the two patients with extremely severe MR showed complete FXD patterns, whereas the remaining two patients with relatively milder MR showed partial FXD patterns. These results indicate that the proportion of FXD cells may be associated with the severity of MR in mosaic ring X Turner syndrome females, although this association should be confirmed by examining brain cells during development. One of the cases with severe MR and a complete FXD pattern neither lacked the XIST gene nor had uniparental X isodisomy, and we discuss the mechanism of the failure of XCI in this case.

TI	A KRAB domain zinc finger protein in imprinting and disease.
PG	487-8
AB	The monoallelic expression of imprinted genes is regulated by DNA methylation marks that originate from the oocyte or sperm. Li et al. (2008) show in this issue of Developmental Cell that the KRAB zinc finger protein Zfp57 contributes to the embryonic maintenance of these imprints. At one locus, Zfp57 is also involved in imprint establishment. These findings provide a mechanistic interpretation for Mackay et al.'s recently reported ZFP57 mutations in patients with transient neonatal diabetes.

TI	Atypical epigenesis.
PG	84-8
AB	It is becoming increasingly clear that little in development is predetermined or permanently fixed. Rather, gene expression is activity dependent, and epigenesis is probabilistic. So, the study of genetic disorders needs to change from the still widely held view that developmental disorders can be accounted for in terms of intact versus impaired modules, to one which takes serious account of the fact that the infant cortex passes from an initial state of high regional interconnectivity to a subsequent state of increasing specialization and localization of function. With such early interconnectivity in mind, developmental neuroscientists must consider the possibility that an early deficit in one part of the brain may have subtle effects on other parts of the developing brain, even when scores fall 'in the normal range'. In studying developmental disorders, it is thus crucial to examine not only domains of clear-cut deficit, but also domains of behavioural proficiency. Atypical epigenesis may often involve a lack of specialization and localization of brain function over developmental time, even in cases of behavioural proficiency.

TI	The first clinical case of a mutation at residue K185 of Kir6.2 (KCNJ11): a major ATP-binding residue.
PG	225-9
AB	BACKGROUND: Closure of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel plays a key role in insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta-cells. Many mutations in KCNJ11 and ABCC8, which respectively encode the pore-forming (Kir6.2) and regulatory (SUR1) subunits of the K(ATP) channel, cause neonatal diabetes. All such mutations impair the ability of metabolically generated ATP to close the channel. Although lysine 185 is predicted to be a major contributor to the ATP-binding site of Kir6.2, no mutations at this residue have been found to cause neonatal diabetes to date. METHODS: We report a 3-year-old girl with permanent neonatal diabetes (PNDM) caused by a novel heterozygous mutation (K185Q) at residue K185 of KCNJ11. The patient presented with marked hyperglycaemia and ketoacidosis at 70 days after birth, and insulin therapy was commenced. RESULTS: Wild-type and mutant K(ATP) channels were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and the effects of intracellular ATP on macroscopic K(ATP) currents in inside-out membrane patches were measured. In the simulated heterozygous state, the K185Q mutation caused a substantial reduction in the ability of MgATP to inhibit the channel. Heterozygous K185Q channels were still blocked effectively by the sulphonylurea tolbutamide. CONCLUSIONS: We report the first clinical case of a PNDM caused by a mutation at K185. Functional studies indicate that the K185Q mutation causes PNDM by reducing the ATP sensitivity of the K(ATP) channel, probably via a reduction in ATP binding to Kir6.2. Based on the experimental data, the patient was successfully transferred to sulphonylurea therapy.

TI	Association of angiotensin-converting enzyme DD genotype with 24-h blood pressure abnormalities in normoalbuminuric children and adolescents with Type 1 diabetes.
PG	1054-9
AB	AIMS: To assess the distribution of the insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene in children and adolescents with Type 1 diabetes and to evaluate the association between ACE genotype and blood pressure (BP). METHODS: ACE genotypes were assessed in 124 normoalbuminuric, clinically normotensive Type 1 diabetic children and adolescents and 120 non-diabetic controls using polymerase chain reaction. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory BP monitoring was undertaken in all patients. RESULTS: ACE genotypes distributed in patients as follows: 34 (27%) DD, 57 (46%) ID, 33 (27%) II. The distribution was similar in the control group: DD in 28% (33), ID in 45% (54), and II in 27% (33). Patients with DD genotype had higher mean 24-h diastolic BP (73.8 +/	6.2 vs. 70.2 +/	5.0 and 69.7 +/	6.3 mmHg; P = 0.005) and lower diurnal variation in BP (11.8 +/	4.6 vs. 14.2 +/	4.2 and 14.8 +/	4.3%; P = 0.011) compared with ID and II groups. Four patients in the DD group proved to be non-dipper compared with one in the ID and none in the II group (P = 0.026). Twenty-four-hour diastolic blood pressure was independently predictive for AER as dependent variable in the DD genotype patient group (r(2) = 0.12, P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Children and adolescents with Type 1 diabetes do not differ from the non-diabetic population regarding the I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene. ACE gene polymorphism is associated with BP abnormalities in normotensive and normoalbuminuric children and adolescents with Type 1 diabetes.

TI	Evidence for linkage on chromosome 4p16.1 in Type 1 diabetes Danish families and complete mutation scanning of the WFS1 (Wolframin) gene.
PG	218-22
AB	AIMS: To investigate whether the WFS1 gene, the gene for Wolfram syndrome, is a susceptibility gene for more common forms of diabetes in the Danish population. METHODS: One hundred and fifty-two Danish Type 1 diabetes mellitus sib-pair families were genotyped for two microsatellite markers situated within 5 cM of the WFS1 gene and analysed for linkage and association using the sib-TDT. The entire coding region, the 5'UTR and 3'UTR of the WFS1 gene, were screened for mutations by direct sequencing in 29 selected Type 1 diabetes patients. Four of the identified mutations were tested for linkage and association in 255 Danish Type 1 diabetes families (including 103 simplex families). RESULTS: Evidence for linkage to Type 1 diabetes was found as the second most frequent allele of the marker D4S394 were transmitted 137 times (T = 61%) and not transmitted 88 times to affected offspring (Puc = 0.0011). Twelve mutations were found in the coding region and three mutations in the 3'UTR. No evidence for linkage and association to Type 1 diabetes was found testing four of the identified amino acid substitutions. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of linkage to Type 1 diabetes was observed in the Danish family collection. However, no evidence of linkage and association was observed for any of the analysed polymorphisms, suggesting that other variations must be responsible for the observed evidence of linkage in the region.

TI	Identification of new mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha gene among families with early onset Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG	193-200
AB	AIMS: Mutations in hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4alpha gene located on chromosome 20q have been found to be responsible for the development of early onset Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Through a national campaign, 53 families with autosomal dominant, early onset Type 2 DM (n=654) were assembled to determine the frequency of mutations in the HNF-4alpha gene and their contribution to the development of diabetes. METHODS: Twelve exons and the promoter region of the HNF-4alpha gene were screened in probands of the families by a double gradient, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DG-DGGE) protocol combined with automated bi-directional sequencing of the PCR products of all heterozygous individuals. RESULTS: We detected two new mutations in the HNF-4alpha gene that changed the amino-acid sequence. The first mutation was a Gly--&gt;Ser substitution in codon 115 within a highly conserved DNA binding domain, and all six carriers of this mutation had diabetes and low insulin secretion. The second mutation was an Ile--&gt;Val substitution in codon 454 within the transactivation domain. It was carried by four family members, two of whom also carried a mutation in the HNF-1alpha gene. Of those having only the mutation in HNF-4alpha one had diabetes and the other had normal glucose tolerance and both were obese and hyperinsulinaemic. Thus, it is uncertain that this mutation is responsible for any of the diabetes in this family. CONCLUSION: We have found that mutations in the HNF-4alpha gene account for a small proportion, about 2-4%, of families with early onset, autosomal dominant, Type 2 DM in US Caucasians.

TI	Epigenetic gene promoter methylation at birth is associated with child's later adiposity.
PG	1528-34
AB	OBJECTIVE: Fixed genomic variation explains only a small proportion of the risk of adiposity. In animal models, maternal diet alters offspring body composition, accompanied by epigenetic changes in metabolic control genes. Little is known about whether such processes operate in humans. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using Sequenom MassARRAY we measured the methylation status of 68 CpGs 5' from five candidate genes in umbilical cord tissue DNA from healthy neonates. Methylation varied greatly at particular CpGs: for 31 CpGs with median methylation &gt;/=5% and a 5-95% range &gt;/=10%, we related methylation status to maternal pregnancy diet and to child's adiposity at age 9 years. Replication was sought in a second independent cohort. RESULTS: In cohort 1, retinoid X receptor-alpha (RXRA) chr9:136355885+ and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) chr7:150315553+ methylation had independent associations with sex-adjusted childhood fat mass (exponentiated regression coefficient [beta] 17% per SD change in methylation [95% CI 4-31], P = 0.009, n = 64, and beta = 20% [9-32], P &lt; 0.001, n = 66, respectively) and %fat mass (beta = 10% [1-19], P = 0.023, n = 64 and beta =12% [4-20], P = 0.002, n = 66, respectively). Regression analyses including sex and neonatal epigenetic marks explained &gt;25% of the variance in childhood adiposity. Higher methylation of RXRA chr9:136355885+, but not of eNOS chr7:150315553+, was associated with lower maternal carbohydrate intake in early pregnancy, previously linked with higher neonatal adiposity in this population. In cohort 2, cord eNOS chr7:150315553+ methylation showed no association with adiposity, but RXRA chr9:136355885+ methylation showed similar associations with fat mass and %fat mass (beta = 6% [2-10] and beta = 4% [1-7], respectively, both P = 0.002, n = 239). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a substantial component of metabolic disease risk has a prenatal developmental basis. Perinatal epigenetic analysis may have utility in identifying individual vulnerability to later obesity and metabolic disease.

TI	Congenital hyperinsulinism and glucose hypersensitivity in homozygous and heterozygous carriers of Kir6.2 (KCNJ11) mutation V290M mutation: K(ATP) channel inactivation mechanism and clinical management.
PG	209-17
AB	OBJECTIVE: The ATP-sensitive K(+) channel (K(ATP)) controls insulin secretion from the islet. Gain	or loss-of-function mutations in channel subunits underlie human neonatal diabetes and congenital hyperinsulinism (HI), respectively. In this study, we sought to identify the mechanistic basis of K(ATP)-induced HI in two probands and to characterize the clinical course. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed HI in two probands and characterized the course of clinical treatment in each, as well as properties of mutant K(ATP) channels expressed in COSm6 cells using Rb efflux and patch-clamp methods. RESULTS: We identified mutation V290M in the pore-forming Kir6.2 subunit in each proband. In vitro expression in COSm6 cells supports the mutation resulting in an inactivating phenotype, which leads to significantly reduced activity in intact cells when expressed homomerically, and to a lesser extent when expressed heteromerically with wild-type subunits. In one heterozygous proband, a fluoro-DOPA scan revealed a causal focal lesion, indicating uniparental disomy with loss of heterozygosity. In a second family, the proband, homozygous for the mutation, was diagnosed with severe diazoxide-unresponsive hypersinsulinism at 2 weeks of age. The patient continues to be treated successfully with octreotide and amlodipine. The parents and a male sibling are heterozygous carriers without overt clinical HI. Interestingly, both the mother and the sibling exhibit evidence of abnormally enhanced glucose tolerance. CONCLUSIONS: V290M results in inactivating K(ATP) channels that underlie HI. Homozygous individuals may be managed medically, without pancreatectomy. Heterozygous carriers also show evidence of enhanced glucose sensitivity, consistent with incomplete loss of K(ATP) channel activity.

TI	Both polymorphic variable number of tandem repeats and autoimmune regulator modulate differential expression of insulin in human thymic epithelial cells.
PG	336-44
AB	OBJECTIVE: Polymorphic INS-VNTR plays an important role in regulating insulin transcript expression in the human thymus that leads to either insulin autoimmunity or tolerance. The molecular mechanisms underlying the INS-VNTR haplotype-dependent insulin expression are still unclear. In this study, we determined the mechanistic components underlying the differential insulin gene expression in human thymic epithelial cells, which should have profound effects on the insulin autoimmune tolerance induction. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A repetitive DNA region designated as a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) is located upstream of the human insulin gene and correlates with the incidence of type 1 diabetes. We generated six class I and two class III VNTR constructs linked to the human insulin basal promoter or SV40 heterologous promoter/enhancer and demonstrated that AIRE protein modulates the insulin promoter activities differentially through binding to the VNTR region. RESULTS: Here we show that in the presence of the autoimmune regulator (AIRE), the class III VNTR haplotype is responsible for an average of three-fold higher insulin expression than class I VNTR in thymic epithelial cells. In a protein-DNA pull-down experiment, AIRE protein is capable of binding to VNTR class I and III probes. Further, the transcriptional activation of the INS-VNTR by AIRE requires the insulin basal promoter. The VNTR sequence loses its activation activity when linked to a heterologous promoter and/or enhancer. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate a type 1 diabetes predisposition encoded by the INS-VNTR locus and a critical function played by AIRE, which constitute a dual control mechanisms regulating quantitative expression of insulin in human thymic epithelial cells.

TI	Ablation of 4E-BP1/2 prevents hyperglycemia-mediated induction of VEGF expression in the rodent retina and in Muller cells in culture.
PG	2107-16
AB	OBJECTIVE: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) contributes to diabetic retinopathy, but control of its expression is not well understood. Here, we tested the hypothesis that hyperglycemia mediates induction of VEGF expression in a eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) binding protein (4E-BP) 1 and 2 dependent manner. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The retina was harvested from control and type 1 diabetic rats and mice and analyzed for VEGF mRNA and protein expression as well as biomarkers of translational control mechanisms. Similar analyses were performed in Muller cell cultures exposed to hyperglycemic conditions. The effect of 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 gene deletion on VEGF expression was examined in mice and in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). RESULTS: Whereas VEGF mRNA in the retina remained constant, VEGF expression was increased as early as 2 weeks after the onset of diabetes. Increases in expression of 4E-BP1 protein mirrored those of VEGF and expression of 4E-BP1 mRNA was unchanged. Similar results were observed after 10 h of exposure of cells in culture to hyperglycemic conditions. Importantly, the diabetes-induced increase in VEGF expression was not observed in mice deficient in 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2, nor in MEFs lacking the two proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperglycemia induces VEGF expression through cap-independent mRNA translation mediated by increased expression of 4E-BP1. Because the VEGF mRNA contains two internal ribosome entry sites, the increased expression is likely a consequence of ribosome loading at these sites. These findings provide new insights into potential targets for treatment of diabetic retinopathy.

TI	Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study: common genetic variants in GCK and TCF7L2 are associated with fasting and postchallenge glucose levels in pregnancy and with the new consensus definition of gestational diabetes mellitus from the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups.
PG	2682-9
AB	OBJECTIVE: Common genetic variants in GCK and TCF7L2 are associated with higher fasting glucose and type 2 diabetes in nonpregnant populations. However, their associations with glucose levels from oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) in pregnancy have not been assessed in a large sample. We hypothesized that these variants are associated with quantitative measures of glycemia in pregnancy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed the associations between variants rs1799884 (GCK) and rs7903146 (TCF7L2) and OGTT outcomes at 24-32 weeks' gestation in 3,811 mothers of European (U.K. and Australia) and 1,706 mothers of Asian (Thailand) ancestry from the HAPO cohort. We also tested associations with offspring birth anthropometrics. RESULTS: The maternal GCK variant was associated with higher fasting glucose in Europeans (P = 0.001) and Thais (P &lt; 0.0001), 1-h glucose in Europeans (P = 0.001), and 2-h glucose in Thais (P = 0.005). It was also associated with higher European offspring birth weight, fat mass, and skinfold thicknesses (P &lt; 0.05). The TCF7L2 variant was associated with all three maternal glucose outcomes (P = 0.03, P &lt; 0.0001, and P &lt; 0.0001 for fasting and 1-h and 2-h glucose, respectively) in the Europeans but not in the Thais (P &gt; 0.05). In both populations, both variants were associated with higher odds of gestational diabetes mellitus according to the new International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups recommendations (P = 0.001-0.08). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal GCK and TCF7L2 variants are associated with glucose levels known to carry an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcome in women without overt diabetes. Further studies will be important to determine the variance in maternal glucose explained by all known genetic variants.

TI	Gene variants of TCF7L2 influence weight loss and body composition during lifestyle intervention in a population at risk for type 2 diabetes.
PG	747-50
AB	OBJECTIVE: The impact of the diabetes risk gene transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) on body weight is unclear. As TCF7L2 is expressed in adipose tissue and involved in Wnt-dependent regulation of adipogenesis, we studied the impact of TCF7L2 variants on body composition and weight loss during lifestyle intervention. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We genotyped 309 German subjects at increased risk for type 2 diabetes for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs7903146, rs12255372, rs11196205, and rs7895340 in TCF7L2 and performed oral glucose tolerance tests before and after a 9-month lifestyle intervention. Fat distribution was quantified using whole-body magnetic resonance imaging/spectroscopy in a subgroup of 210 subjects. RESULTS: After adjustment for confounding variables, we observed a negative impact of the type 2 diabetes allele of SNP rs7903146 on change in BMI (P = 0.0034) and on changes in nonvisceral (P = 0.0032) and visceral fat (P = 0.0165) during lifestyle intervention. An association of rs7903146 with lifestyle intervention-induced changes in insulin secretion, glucose concentrations, liver fat, or insulin sensitivity were not detected (all P &gt; 0.2). Essentially the same results were obtained with SNP rs1255372. In contrast, we found no effects of SNPs rs11196205 and rs7895340 on change in BMI (all P &gt; or = 0.5). CONCLUSIONS: Our data reveal that diabetes-associated alleles of TCF7L2 are associated with less weight loss in response to lifestyle intervention. Thus, diabetes-associated TCF7L2 gene variation predicts the success of lifestyle intervention in terms of weight loss and determines individual susceptibility toward environmental factors.

TI	Examination of all type 2 diabetes GWAS loci reveals HHEX-IDE as a locus influencing pediatric BMI.
PG	751-5
AB	OBJECTIVE: A number of studies have found that BMI in early life influences the risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Our goal was to investigate if any type 2 diabetes variants uncovered through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) impact BMI in childhood. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using data from an ongoing GWAS of pediatric BMI in our cohort, we investigated the association of pediatric BMI with 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms at 18 type 2 diabetes loci uncovered through GWAS, consisting of ADAMTS9, CDC123-CAMK1D, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/B, EXT2, FTO, HHEX-IDE, IGF2BP2, the intragenic region on 11p12, JAZF1, KCNQ1, LOC387761, MTNR1B, NOTCH2, SLC30A8, TCF7L2, THADA, and TSPAN8-LGR5. We randomly partitioned our cohort exactly in half in order to have a discovery cohort (n = 3,592) and a replication cohort (n = 3,592). RESULTS: Our data show that the major type 2 diabetes risk-conferring G allele of rs7923837 at the HHEX-IDE locus was associated with higher pediatric BMI in both the discovery (P = 0.0013 and survived correction for 20 tests) and replication (P = 0.023) sets (combined P = 1.01 x 10(-4)). Association was not detected with any other known type 2 diabetes loci uncovered to date through GWAS except for the well-established FTO. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that the same genetic HHEX-IDE variant, which is associated with type 2 diabetes from previous studies, also influences pediatric BMI.

TI	Examination of type 2 diabetes loci implicates CDKAL1 as a birth weight gene.
PG	2414-8
AB	OBJECTIVE: A number of studies have found that reduced birth weight is associated with type 2 diabetes later in life; however, the underlying mechanism for this correlation remains unresolved. Recently, association has been demonstrated between low birth weight and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the CDKAL1 and HHEX-IDE loci, regions that were previously implicated in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. In order to investigate whether type 2 diabetes risk-conferring alleles associate with low birth weight in our Caucasian childhood cohort, we examined the effects of 20 such loci on this trait. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using data from an ongoing genome-wide association study in our cohort of 5,465 Caucasian children with recorded birth weights, we investigated the association of the previously reported type 2 diabetes-associated variation at 20 loci including TCF7L2, HHEX-IDE, PPARG, KCNJ11, SLC30A8, IGF2BP2, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/2B, and JAZF1 with birth weight. RESULTS: Our data show that the minor allele of rs7756992 (P = 8 x 10(-5)) at the CDKAL1 locus is strongly associated with lower birth weight, whereas a perfect surrogate for variation previously implicated for the trait at the same locus only yielded nominally significant association (P = 0.01; r(2) rs7756992 = 0.677). However, association was not detected with any of the other type 2 diabetes loci studied. CONCLUSIONS: We observe association between lower birth weight and type 2 diabetes risk-conferring alleles at the CDKAL1 locus. Our data show that the same genetic locus that has been identified as a marker for type 2 diabetes in previous studies also influences birth weight.

TI	Association of variants in RETN with plasma resistin levels and diabetes-related traits in the Framingham Offspring Study.
PG	750-6
AB	OBJECTIVE: The RETN gene encodes the adipokine resistin. Associations of RETN with plasma resistin levels, type 2 diabetes, and related metabolic traits have been inconsistent. Using comprehensive linkage disequilibrium mapping, we genotyped tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in RETN and tested associations with plasma resistin levels, risk of diabetes, and glycemic traits. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined 2,531 Framingham Offspring Study participants for resistin levels, glycemic phenotypes, and incident diabetes over 28 years of follow-up. We genotyped 21 tag SNPs that capture common (minor allele frequency &gt;0.05) or previously reported SNPs at r2 &gt; 0.8 across RETN and its flanking regions. We used sex	and age-adjusted linear mixed-effects models (with/without BMI adjustment) to test additive associations of SNPs with traits, adjusted Cox proportional hazards models accounting for relatedness for incident diabetes, and generated empirical P values (Pe) to control for type 1 error. RESULTS: Four tag SNPs (rs1477341, rs4804765, rs1423096, and rs10401670) on the 3' side of RETN were strongly associated with resistin levels (all minor alleles associated with higher levels, Pe&lt;0.05 after multiple testing correction). rs10401670 was also associated with fasting plasma glucose (Pe = 0.02, BMI adjusted) and mean glucose over follow-up (Pe = 0.01; BMI adjusted). No significant association was observed for adiposity traits. On meta-analysis, the previously reported association of SNP -420C/G (rs1862513) with resistin levels remained significant (P = 0.0009) but with high heterogeneity across studies (P &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: SNPs in the 3' region of RETN are associated with resistin levels, and one of them is also associated with glucose levels, although replication is needed.

TI	A single-nucleotide polymorphism in a methylatable Foxa2 binding site of the G6PC2 promoter is associated with insulin secretion in vivo and increased promoter activity in vitro.
PG	489-92
AB	OBJECTIVE: The G6PC2 gene encoding islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase related protein (IGRP) has a common promoter variant, rs573225 (-231G/A), located within a Foxa binding site. We tested the cis-regulatory effects of rs573225 on promoter activity and its association with insulin response to oral glucose. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Functional effects of rs573225 were explored in transfected INS-1 and HIT-T beta-cell lines. A total of 734 young obese subjects of European ancestry were genotyped for rs573225. Insulin and glucose levels were measured in response to oral glucose, and the insulinogenic index (IGI) of insulin secretion was calculated. RESULTS: In vitro, the G allele showed a higher affinity for binding Foxa2 transcription factor and increased G6PC2 promoter activity. Foxa2 binding is modified if the C adjacent to the G allele is methylated. IGI was associated with rs573225 by linear regression analysis and was 30% greater in AA or AG than in GG obese children. rs573225 was also associated with fasting glucose. CONCLUSIONS: rs573225 is a functional cis-regulatory (epi)-single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of G6PC2 associated with glucose-insulin homeostasis in obese children, likely to explain the results of recent genome-wide association studies in nondiabetic adults.

TI	Breast-feeding modifies the association of PPARgamma2 polymorphism Pro12Ala with growth in early life: the Generation R Study.
PG	992-8
AB	OBJECTIVE: We examined whether the PPARgamma2 Ala12 allele influences growth in early life and whether this association is modified by breast-feeding. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was embedded in the Generation R Study, a prospective cohort study from early fetal life onward. PPARgamma2 was genotyped in DNA obtained from cord blood samples in 3,432 children. Information about breast-feeding was available from questionnaires. Weight, head circumference, and femur length were repeatedly measured in second and third trimesters of pregnancy, at birth, and at the ages of 1.5, 6, 11, 14, and 18 months. RESULTS: Genotype frequency distribution was 77.6% (Pro12Pro), 20.7% (Pro12Ala), and 1.7% (Ala12Ala). Growth rates in weight from second trimester of pregnancy to 18 months were higher for Pro12Ala and Ala12Ala than for Pro12Pro carriers (differences 1.11 g/week [95% CI 0.47-1.74] and 2.65 g/week [0.45-4.87], respectively). We found an interaction between genotype and breast-feeding duration (P value for interaction &lt;0.0001). In infants who were breast-fed for &gt; or =4 months, PPARgamma2 Pro12Ala was not associated with growth rate. When breast-feeding duration was &lt;2 months or 2-4 months, growth rate was higher in Ala12Ala than Pro12Pro carriers (differences 9.80 g/week [3.97-15.63] and 6.32 g/week [-1.04 to 13.68], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The PPARgamma2 Ala12 allele is associated with an increased growth rate in early life. This effect may be influenced by breast-feeding duration. Further studies should replicate these findings, identify the underlying mechanisms, and assess whether these effects persist into later life.

TI	Impact of diabetes susceptibility loci on progression from pre-diabetes to diabetes in at-risk individuals of the diabetes prevention trial-type 1 (DPT-1).
PG	2348-59
AB	OBJECTIVE: The unfolding of type 1 diabetes involves a number of steps: defective immunological tolerance, priming of anti-islet autoimmunity, and destruction of insulin-producing beta-cells. A number of genetic loci contribute to susceptibility to type 1 diabetes, but it is unclear which stages of the disease are influenced by the different loci. Here, we analyzed the frequency of type 1 diabetes-risk alleles among individuals from the Diabetes Prevention Trial-Type 1 (DPT-1) clinical trial, which tested a preventive effect of insulin in at-risk relatives of diabetic individuals, all of which presented with autoimmune manifestations but only one-third of which eventually progressed to diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study, 708 individuals randomized into DPT-1 were genotyped for 37 single nucleotide polymorphisms in diabetes susceptibility loci. RESULTS: Susceptibility alleles at loci expected to influence immunoregulation (PTPN22, CTLA4, and IL2RA) did not differ between progressors and nonprogressors but were elevated in both groups relative to general population frequencies, as was the INS promoter variant. In contrast, HLA DQB1*0302 and DQB1*0301 differed significantly in progressors versus nonprogressors (DQB*0302, 42.6 vs. 34.7%, P = 0.0047; DQB*0301, 8.6 vs. 14.3%, P = 0.0026). Multivariate analysis of the factors contributing to progression demonstrated that initial titers of anti-insulin autoantibodies (IAAs) could account for some (P = 0.0016) but not all of this effect on progression (P = 0.00038 for the independent effect of the number of DQB*0302 alleles). The INS-23 genotype was most strongly associated with anti-IAAs (median IAA levels in TT individuals, 60 nU/ml; AT, 121; and AA, 192; P = 0.000037) and only suggestively to the outcome of oral insulin administration. CONCLUSIONS: With the exception of HLA, most susceptibility loci tested condition the risk of autoimmunity rather than the risk of failed immunoregulation that results in islet destruction. Future clinical trials might consider genotyping INS-23 in addition to HLA alleles as disease/treatment response modifier.

TI	A human type 1 diabetes susceptibility locus maps to chromosome 21q22.3.
PG	2858-61
AB	OBJECTIVE: The Type 1 Diabetes Genetics Consortium (T1DGC) has assembled and genotyped a large collection of multiplex families for the purpose of mapping genomic regions linked to type 1 diabetes. In the current study, we tested for evidence of loci associated with type 1 diabetes utilizing genome-wide linkage scan data and family-based association methods. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 2,496 multiplex families with type 1 diabetes were genotyped with a panel of 6,090 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Evidence of association to disease was evaluated by the pedigree disequilibrium test. Significant results were followed up by genotyping and analyses in two independent sets of samples: 2,214 parent-affected child trio families and a panel of 7,721 case and 9,679 control subjects. RESULTS	Three of the SNPs most strongly associated with type 1 diabetes localized to previously identified type 1 diabetes risk loci: INS, IFIH1, and KIAA0350. A fourth strongly associated SNP, rs876498 (P = 1.0 x 10(-4)), occurred in the sixth intron of the UBASH3A locus at chromosome 21q22.3. Support for this disease association was obtained in two additional independent sample sets: families with type 1 diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 1.06 [95% CI 1.00-1.11]; P = 0.023) and case and control subjects (1.14 [1.09-1.19]; P = 7.5 x 10(-8)). CONCLUSIONS: The T1DGC 6K SNP scan and follow-up studies reported here confirm previously reported type 1 diabetes associations at INS, IFIH1, and KIAA0350 and identify an additional disease association on chromosome 21q22.3 in the UBASH3A locus (OR 1.10 [95% CI 1.07-1.13]; P = 4.4 x 10(-12)). This gene and its flanking regions are now validated targets for further resequencing, genotyping, and functional studies in type 1 diabetes.

TI	Persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and maturity-onset diabetes of the young due to heterozygous HNF4A mutations.
PG	1659-63
AB	OBJECTIVE: Mutations in the human HNF4A gene encoding the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4alpha are known to cause maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), which is characterized by autosomal-dominant inheritance and impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells. HNF-4alpha has a key role in regulating the multiple transcriptional factor networks in the islet. Recently, heterozygous mutations in the HNF4A gene were reported to cause transient hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia associated with macrosomia. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Three infants presented with macrosomia and severe hypoglycemia with a positive family history of MODY. The hypoglycemia was confirmed to be due to hyperinsulinism, and all three patients required diazoxide therapy to maintain normoglycemia. Two of the three infants are still requiring diazoxide therapy at 8 and 18 months, whereas one of them had resolution of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia at 32 months of age. RESULTS: Sequencing of the HNF4A gene identified heterozygous mutations in all three families. In family 1, a frameshift mutation L330fsdel17ins9 (c.987 1003del17ins9; p.Leu330fs) was present in the proband; a mutation affecting the conserved A nucleotide of the intron 2 branch site (c.264-21A&gt;G) was identified in the proband of family 2; and finally a nonsense mutation, Y16X (c.48C&gt;G, p.Tyr16X), was found in the proband of family 3. CONCLUSIONS: Heterozygous HNF4A mutations can therefore cause both transient and persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia associated with macrosomia. We recommend that macrosomic infants with transient or persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia should be screened for HNF4A mutations if there is a family history of youth-onset diabetes.

TI	Association analysis of type 2 diabetes Loci in type 1 diabetes.
PG	1983-6
AB	OBJECTIVE: To search for a possible association of type 1 diabetes with 10 validated type 2 diabetes loci, i.e., PPARG, KCNJ11, WFS1, HNF1B, IDE/HHEX, SLC30A8, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/B, IGF2BP2, and FTO/RPGRIP1L. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Two European population samples were studied: 1) one case-control cohort of 514 type 1 diabetic subjects and 2,027 control subjects and 2) one family cohort of 483 complete type 1 diabetic case-parent trios (total 997 affected). A total of 13 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the 10 type 2 diabetes loci were analyzed for type 1 diabetes association. RESULTS: No association of type 1 diabetes was found with any of the 10 type 2 diabetes loci, and no age-at-onset effect was detected. By combined analysis using the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium type 1 diabetes data, SNP rs1412829 in the CDKN2A/B locus bordered on significance (P = 0.039) (odds ratio 0.929 [95% CI 0.867-0.995]), which did not reach the statistical significance threshold adjusted for 13 tests (alpha = 0.00385). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the type 2 diabetes loci do not play any obvious role in type 1 diabetes genetic susceptibility. The distinct molecular mechanisms of the two diseases highlighted the importance of differentiation diagnosis and different treatment principles.

TI	Mosaic paternal uniparental isodisomy and an ABCC8 gene mutation in a patient with permanent neonatal diabetes and hemihypertrophy.
PG	255-8
AB	OBJECTIVE: Activating mutations in the KCNJ11 and ABCC8 genes encoding the Kir6.2 and SUR1 subunits of the pancreatic ATP-sensitive K(+) channel are the most common cause of permanent neonatal diabetes. In contrast to KCNJ11, where only dominant heterozygous mutations have been identified, recessively acting ABCC8 mutations have recently been found in some patients with neonatal diabetes. These genes are co-located on chromosome 11p15.1, centromeric to the imprinted Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) locus at 11p15.5. We investigated a male with hemihypertrophy, a condition classically associated with neonatal hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia, who developed neonatal diabetes at age 5 weeks. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The KCNJ11 and ABCC8 genes and microsatellite markers on chromosome 11 were analyzed in DNA samples from the patient and his parents. RESULTS: A paternally inherited activating mutation (N72S) in the ABCC8 gene was identified in the proband. The mutation was present at 70% in the patient's leukocytes and 50% in buccal cells. Microsatellite analysis demonstrated mosaic segmental paternal uniparental isodisomy (UPD) of 11pter-11p14 in the proband that encompassed the ABCC8 gene and the BWS locus. CONCLUSIONS: We report a patient with neonatal diabetes, hemihypertrophy, and relatively high birth weight resulting from telomeric segmental paternal UPD of chromosome 11, which unmasks a recessively acting gain-of-function mutation in the ABCC8 gene and causes deregulation of imprinted genes at the BWS locus on 11p15.5.

TI	Nephropathy in type 1 diabetes is diminished in carriers of HLA-DRB1*04: the genetics of kidneys in diabetes (GoKinD) study.
PG	518-22
AB	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine whether known genetic risk factors for type 1 diabetes (HLA-DRB1, -DQA1, and -DQB1 and insulin locus) play a role in the etiology of diabetic nephropathy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS; Genetic analysis of HLA-DRB1, -DQA1, -DQB1 and the insulin gene (INS) was performed in the Genetics of Kidneys in Diabetes (GoKinD) collection of DNA (European ancestry subset), which includes case patients with type 1 diabetes and nephropathy (n = 829) and control patients with type 1 diabetes but not nephropathy (n = 904). The availability of phenotypic and genotypic data on GoKinD participants allowed a detailed analysis of the association of these genes with diabetic nephropathy. RESULTS: Diabetic probands who were homozygous for HLA-DRB1*04 were 50% less likely to have nephropathy than probands without any DRB1*04 alleles. In heterozygous carriers, a protective effect of this allele was not as clearly evident; the mode of inheritance therefore remains unclear. This association was seen in probands with both short (&lt;28 years, P = 0.02) and long (&gt;/=28 years, P = 0.0001) duration of diabetes. A1C, a marker of sustained hyperglycemia, was increased in control probands with normoalbuminuira, despite long-duration diabetes, from 7.2 to 7.3 to 7.7% with 0, 1, and 2 copies of the DRB1*04 allele, respectively. This result is consistent with a protective effect of DRB1*04 that may allow individuals to tolerate higher levels of hyperglycemia, as measured by A1C, without developing nephropathy. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that carriers of DRB1*04 are protected from some of the injurious hyperglycemic effects related to nephropathy. Interestingly, DRB1*04 appears to be both a risk allele for type 1 diabetes and a protective allele for nephropathy.

TI	Common variants in the adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) associated with plasma adiponectin levels, type 2 diabetes, and diabetes-related quantitative traits: the Framingham Offspring Study.
PG	3353-9
AB	OBJECTIVE: Variants in ADIPOQ have been inconsistently associated with adiponectin levels or diabetes. Using comprehensive linkage disequilibrium mapping, we genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ADIPOQ to evaluate the association of common variants with adiponectin levels and risk of diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants in the Framingham Offspring Study (n = 2,543, 53% women) were measured for glycemic phenotypes and incident diabetes over 28 years of follow-up; adiponectin levels were quantified at exam 7. We genotyped 22 tag SNPs that captured common (minor allele frequency &gt;0.05) variation at r(2) &gt; 0.8 across ADIPOQ plus 20 kb 5' and 10 kb 3' of the gene. We used linear mixed effects models to test additive associations of each SNP with adiponectin levels and glycemic phenotypes. Hazard ratios (HRs) for incident diabetes were estimated using an adjusted Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Two promoter SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium with each other (r(2) = 0.80) were associated with adiponectin levels (rs17300539; P(nominal) [P(n)] = 2.6 x 10(-8); P(empiric) [P(e)] = 0.0005 and rs822387; P(n) = 3.8 x 10(-5); P(e) = 0.001). A 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) SNP (rs6773957) was associated with adiponectin levels (P(n) = 4.4 x 10(-4); P(e) = 0.005). A nonsynonymous coding SNP (rs17366743, Y111H) was confirmed to be associated with diabetes incidence (HR 1.94 [95% CI 1.16-3.25] for the minor C allele; P(n) = 0.01) and with higher mean fasting glucose over 28 years of follow-up (P(n) = 0.0004; P(e) = 0.004). No other significant associations were found with other adiposity and metabolic phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Adiponectin levels are associated with SNPs in two different regulatory regions (5' promoter and 3'UTR), whereas diabetes incidence and time-averaged fasting glucose are associated with a missense SNP of ADIPOQ.

TI	Role of the ENPP1 K121Q polymorphism in glucose homeostasis.
PG	3360-4
AB	OBJECTIVE: To study the role of the ENPP1 Q121 variant on glucose homeostasis in whites from Italy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted case-control studies in 764 adults (from two independent samples of 289 nonobese and 485 obese individuals) and 240 overweight/obese children undergoing oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT). Early-phase insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity (the insulinogenic index and the insulin sensitivity index) and their interplay (the disposition index) were calculated. RESULTS: In adult subjects, glucose profiles during OGTT were significantly (P = 2 x 10(-2)) different across K121Q genotype groups and higher in QQ than KK individuals (P = 5 x 10(-2)). The insulinogenic index was significantly reduced in QQ (18.5 +/	3.4) compared with both KK (31.6 +/	1.0; P = 2.2 x 10(-7)) and KQ (30.5 +/	1.5; P = 3.2 x 10(-6)) individuals. KQ individuals also showed a reduced insulin sensitivity index compared with KK subjects (P = 3.6 x 10(-2)). The disposition index was lower in QQ carriers than in KQ and KK individuals (P = 8 x 10(-3) and 4 x 10(-4), respectively) and lower in KQ than in KK individuals (P = 3 x 10(-2)). Data obtained in overweight/obese children were very similar to those observed in adults, with QQ individuals showing (compared with KQ and KK subjects) a reduced insulinogenic index (P = 7 x 10(-3) and 2 x 10(-2), respectively) and disposition index (P = 2 x 10(-2) and 7 x 10(-3), respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Homozygous carriers of the ENPP1 Q121 variant are characterized by an altered glucose homeostasis. Reduced early-phase insulin secretion and inefficient interplay between insulin secretion and sensitivity, which occur at early ages, are major determinants of this defect.

TI	Lymphocytes from patients with type 1 diabetes display a distinct profile of chromatin histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation: an epigenetic study in diabetes.
PG	3189-98
AB	OBJECTIVE: The complexity of interactions between genes and the environment is a major challenge for type 1 diabetes studies. Nuclear chromatin is the interface between genetics and environment and the principal carrier of epigenetic information. Because histone tail modifications in chromatin are linked to gene transcription, we hypothesized that histone methylation patterns in cells from type 1 diabetic patients can provide novel epigenetic insights into type 1 diabetes and its complications. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) linked to microarray (ChIP-chip) approach to compare genome-wide histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) patterns in blood lymphocytes and monocytes from type 1 diabetic patients versus healthy control subjects. Bioinformatics evaluation of methylated candidates was performed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) tools. RESULTS: A subset of genes in the type 1 diabetic cohort showed significant increase in H3K9me2 in lymphocytes but not in monocytes. CLTA4, a type 1 diabetes susceptibility gene, was one of the candidates displaying increased promoter H3K9me2 in type 1 diabetes. IPA identified two high-scoring networks that encompassed genes showing altered H3K9me2. Many of them were associated with autoimmune and inflammation-related pathways, such as transforming growth factor-beta, nuclear factor-kappaB, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, toll-like receptor, and interleukin-6. IPA also revealed biological relationships between these networks and known type 1 diabetes candidate genes. CONCLUSIONS: The concerted and synergistic alteration of histone methylation within the identified network in lymphocytes might have an effect on the etiology of type 1 diabetes and its complications. These studies provide evidence of a novel association between type 1 diabetes and altered histone methylation of key genes that are components of type 1 diabetes-related biological pathways and also a new understanding of the pathology of type 1 diabetes.

TI	Mutations in the insulin gene can cause MODY and autoantibody-negative type 1 diabetes.
PG	1131-5
AB	OBJECTIVE: Mutations in the insulin (INS) gene can cause neonatal diabetes. We hypothesized that mutations in INS could also cause maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) and autoantibody-negative type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We screened INS in 62 probands with MODY, 30 probands with suspected MODY, and 223 subjects from the Norwegian Childhood Diabetes Registry selected on the basis of autoantibody negativity or family history of diabetes. RESULTS: Among the MODY patients, we identified the INS mutation c.137G&gt;A (R46Q) in a proband, his diabetic father, and a paternal aunt. They were diagnosed with diabetes at 20, 18, and 17 years of age, respectively, and are treated with small doses of insulin or diet only. In type 1 diabetic patients, we found the INS mutation c.163C&gt;T (R55C) in a girl who at 10 years of age presented with ketoacidosis and insulin-dependent, GAD, and insulinoma-associated antigen-2 (IA-2) antibody-negative diabetes. Her mother had a de novo R55C mutation and was diagnosed with ketoacidosis and insulin-dependent diabetes at 13 years of age. Both had residual beta-cell function. The R46Q substitution changes an invariant arginine residue in position B22, which forms a hydrogen bond with the glutamate at A17, stabilizing the insulin molecule. The R55C substitution involves the first of the two arginine residues localized at the site of proteolytic processing between the B-chain and the C-peptide. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings extend the phenotype of INS mutation carriers and suggest that INS screening is warranted not only in neonatal diabetes, but also in MODY and in selected cases of type 1 diabetes.

TI	Heterozygous missense mutations in the insulin gene are linked to permanent diabetes appearing in the neonatal period or in early infancy: a report from the French ND (Neonatal Diabetes) Study Group.
PG	1115-9
AB	OBJECTIVE: Permanent neonatal diabetes (PND) is defined by chronic hyperglycemia due to severe nonautoimmune insulin deficiency diagnosed in the first months of life. Several genes, including KCNJ11 and ABCC8, which encode the two subunits of the ATP-sensitive K(+) channel (K(ATP) channel) can cause PND. Mutations in the insulin (INS) gene have been recently described in families with neonatal diabetes. Our study aimed to investigate the genetic anomalies and clinical heterogeneity in PND patients who are negative for a K(ATP) channel mutation. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We screened the INS gene by direct sequencing in 38 PND patients and in one child with nonautoimmune early-infancy diabetes, where no mutation in GCK, KCNJ11, and ABCC8 was identified. A detailed clinical phenotyping of the patients was carried out to specify the diabetes features in those found with an INS mutation. RESULTS: We identified three missense mutations in the INS gene in four probands. Two of four mutations were inherited in a dominant manner, and the familial description evidenced a marked variability in age of diagnosis and disease progression. In our cohort, the INS mutations may represent approximately 10% of all permanent neonatal diabetes cases, having a later presentation of diabetes and no associated symptoms compared with cases with K(ATP) channel mutations. CONCLUSIONS; Heterozygous INS gene mutations can cause isolated permanent early-infancy diabetes and should be assessed in neonatal as well as in childhood diabetes appearing like type 1, when autoimmune markers are absent. New pharmacogenomic strategies may be applicable, since residual beta-cell function is still present in some patients.

TI	Insulin mutation screening in 1,044 patients with diabetes: mutations in the INS gene are a common cause of neonatal diabetes but a rare cause of diabetes diagnosed in childhood or adulthood.
PG	1034-42
AB	OBJECTIVE: Insulin gene (INS) mutations have recently been described as a cause of permanent neonatal diabetes (PND). We aimed to determine the prevalence, genetics, and clinical phenotype of INS mutations in large cohorts of patients with neonatal diabetes and permanent diabetes diagnosed in infancy, childhood, or adulthood. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The INS gene was sequenced in 285 patients with diabetes diagnosed before 2 years of age, 296 probands with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), and 463 patients with young-onset type 2 diabetes (nonobese, diagnosed &lt;45 years). None had a molecular genetic diagnosis of monogenic diabetes. RESULTS: We identified heterozygous INS mutations in 33 of 141 probands diagnosed at &lt;6 months, 2 of 86 between 6 and 12 months, and none of 58 between 12 and 24 months of age. Three known mutations (A24D, F48C, and R89C) account for 46% of cases. There were six novel mutations: H29D, L35P, G84R, C96S, S101C, and Y103C. INS mutation carriers were all insulin treated from diagnosis and were diagnosed later than ATP-sensitive K(+) channel mutation carriers (11 vs. 8 weeks, P &lt; 0.01). In 279 patients with PND, the frequency of KCNJ11, ABCC8, and INS gene mutations was 31, 10, and 12%, respectively. A heterozygous R6C mutation cosegregated with diabetes in a MODY family and is probably pathogenic, but the L68M substitution identified in a patient with young-onset type 2 diabetes may be a rare nonfunctional variant. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that INS mutations are the second most common cause of PND and a rare cause of MODY. Insulin gene mutation screening is recommended for all diabetic patients diagnosed before 1 year of age.

TI	Screening of 134 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with type 2 diabetes replicates association with 12 SNPs in nine genes.
PG	256-64
AB	More than 120 published reports have described associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and type 2 diabetes. However, multiple studies of the same variant have often been discordant. From a literature search, we identified previously reported type 2 diabetes-associated SNPs. We initially genotyped 134 SNPs on 786 index case subjects from type 2 diabetes families and 617 control subjects with normal glucose tolerance from Finland and excluded from analysis 20 SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium (r(2) &gt; 0.8) with another typed SNP. Of the 114 SNPs examined, we followed up the 20 most significant SNPs (P &lt; 0.10) on an additional 384 case subjects and 366 control subjects from a population-based study in Finland. In the combined data, we replicated association (P &lt; 0.05) for 12 SNPs: PPARG Pro12Ala and His447, KCNJ11 Glu23Lys and rs5210, TNF -857, SLC2A2 Ile110Thr, HNF1A/TCF1 rs2701175 and GE117881_360, PCK1 -232, NEUROD1 Thr45Ala, IL6 -598, and ENPP1 Lys121Gln. The replication of 12 SNPs of 114 tested was significantly greater than expected by chance under the null hypothesis of no association (P = 0.012). We observed that SNPs from genes that had three or more previous reports of association were significantly more likely to be replicated in our sample (P = 0.03), although we also replicated 4 of 58 SNPs from genes that had only one previous report of association.

TI	Multiple variants in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA) are risk factors for time to severe retinopathy in type 1 diabetes: the DCCT/EDIC genetics study.
PG	2161-8
AB	OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine if any common variants in the gene for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA) are associated with long-term renal and retinal complications in type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 1,369 Caucasian subjects with type 1 diabetes from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) Study had an average of 17 retinal photographs and 10 renal measures over 15 years. In the DCCT/EDIC, we studied 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in VEGFA that represent all linkage disequilibrium bins (pairwise r(2) &gt; or = 0.64) and tested them for association with time to development of severe retinopathy, three or more step progression of retinopathy, clinically significant macular edema, persistent microalbuminuria, and severe nephropathy. RESULTS: In a global multi-SNP test, there was a highly significant association of VEGFA SNPs with severe retinopathy (P = 6.8 x 10(-5))-the four other outcomes were all nonsignificant. In survival analyses controlling for covariate risk factors, eight SNPs showed significant association with severe retinopathy (P &lt; 0.05). The most significant single SNP association was rs3025021 (hazard ratio 1.37 [95% CI 1.13-1.66], P = 0.0017). Family-based analyses of severe retinopathy provide evidence of excess transmission of C at rs699947 (P = 0.029), T at rs3025021 (P = 0.013), and the C-T haplotype from both SNPs (P = 0.035). Multi-SNP regression analysis including 15 SNPs, and allowing for pairwise interactions, independently selected 6 significant SNPs (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that multiple VEGFA variants are associated with the development of severe retinopathy in type 1 diabetes.

TI	Association analysis of 6,736 U.K. subjects provides replication and confirms TCF7L2 as a type 2 diabetes susceptibility gene with a substantial effect on individual risk.
PG	2640-4
AB	Recent data suggest that common variation in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene is associated with type 2 diabetes. Evaluation of such associations in independent samples provides necessary replication and a robust assessment of effect size. Using four TCF7L2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; including the two most associated in the previous study), we conducted a case-control study in 2,158 type 2 diabetic subjects and 2,574 control subjects and a family-based association analysis in 388 parent-offspring trios all from the U.K. All SNPs showed powerful associations with diabetes in the case-control analysis, with strongest effects at rs7903146 (allele-wise relative risk 1.36 [95% CI 1.24-1.48], P = 1.3 x 10(-11)). Data were consistent with a multiplicative model. The family-based analyses provided independent evidence for association at all loci (e.g., rs4506565, 62% transmission, P = 7 x 10(-5)) with no parent-of-origin effects. The frequency of diabetes-associated TCF7L2 genotypes was greater in cases ascertained for positive family history and early onset (rs4606565, P = 0.02); the population-attributable risk, estimated from the least-selected cases, is approximately 16%. The overall evidence for association for these variants (P = 4.4 x 10(-14) combining case-control and family-based analyses for rs4506565) exceeds genome-wide significance criteria and clearly establishes TCF7L2 as a type 2 diabetes susceptibility gene of substantial importance.

TI	Bardet-Biedl syndrome gene variants are associated with both childhood and adult common obesity in French Caucasians.
PG	2876-82
AB	Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a rare developmental disorder with the cardinal features of abdominal obesity, retinopathy, polydactyly, cognitive impairment, renal and cardiac anomalies, hypertension, and diabetes. BBS is genetically heterogeneous, with nine genes identified to date and evidence for additional loci. In this study, we performed mutation analysis of the coding and conserved regions of BBS1, BBS2, BBS4, and BBS6 in 48 French Caucasian individuals. Among the 36 variants identified, 12 were selected and genotyped in 1,943 French-Caucasian case subjects and 1,299 French-Caucasian nonobese nondiabetic control subjects. Variants in BBS2, BBS4, and BBS6 showed evidence of association with common obesity in an age-dependent manner, the BBS2 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) being associated with common adult obesity (P = 0.0005) and the BBS4 and BBS6 SNPs being associated with common early-onset childhood obesity (P = 0.0003) and common adult morbid obesity (0.0003 &lt; P &lt; 0.007). The association of the BBS4 rs7178130 variant was found to be supported by transmission disequilibrium testing (P = 0.006). The BBS6 variants also showed nominal evidence of association with quantitative components of the metabolic syndrome (e.g., dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia), a complication previously described in BBS patients. In summary, our preliminary data suggest that variations at BBS genes are associated with risk of common obesity.

TI	A Kir6.2 mutation causing neonatal diabetes impairs electrical activity and insulin secretion from INS-1 beta-cells.
PG	3075-82
AB	ATP-sensitive K(+) channels (K(ATP) channels) couple beta-cell metabolism to electrical activity and thereby play an essential role in the control of insulin secretion. Gain-of-function mutations in Kir6.2 (KCNJ11), the pore-forming subunit of this channel, cause neonatal diabetes. We investigated the effect of the most common neonatal diabetes mutation (R201H) on beta-cell electrical activity and insulin secretion by stable transfection in the INS-1 cell line. Expression was regulated by placing the gene under the control of a tetracycline promoter. Transfection with wild-type Kir6.2 had no effect on the ATP sensitivity of the K(ATP) channel, whole-cell K(ATP) current magnitude, or insulin secretion. However, induction of Kir6.2-R201H expression strongly reduced K(ATP) channel ATP sensitivity (the half-maximal inhibitory concentration increased from approximately 20 mumol/l to approximately 2 mmol/l), and the metabolic substrate methyl succinate failed to close K(ATP) channels or stimulate electrical activity and insulin secretion. Thus, these results directly demonstrate that Kir6.2 mutations prevent electrical activity and insulin release from INS-1 cells by increasing the K(ATP) current and hyperpolarizing the beta-cell membrane. This is consistent with the ability of the R201H mutation to cause neonatal diabetes in patients. The relationship between K(ATP) current and the membrane potential reveals that very small changes in current amplitude are sufficient to prevent hormone secretion.

TI	Single nucleotide polymorphisms of PPARD in combination with the Gly482Ser substitution of PGC-1A and the Pro12Ala substitution of PPARG2 predict the conversion from impaired glucose tolerance to type 2 diabetes: the STOP-NIDDM trial.
PG	2148-52
AB	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-delta regulates fatty acid oxidation and improves insulin sensitivity. We screened six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the PPAR-delta gene (PPARD) for an association with the conversion from impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) to type 2 diabetes in 769 subjects participating in the STOP-NIDDM trial. A 2.7-fold increase in the risk of diabetes was observed in female carriers of the C allele of rs6902123 (95% CI 1.44-5.30; adjusted P = 0.002). In the placebo group, subjects possessing both the 482Ser allele of the PPAR-gamma coactivator-1alpha gene (PGC-1A) and the rare allele of two SNPs of PPARD (rs6902123 and rs3734254) had up to 2.5-fold increased risk for diabetes. Furthermore, women carrying the C allele of rs6902123 of PPARD and the Pro12Pro genotype of the PPAR-gamma2 gene (PPARG2) had a 3.9-fold (95% CI 1.79-8.63; P = 0.001)-higher risk for diabetes than women with protective genotypes. Expression levels of PPAR-delta in subcutaneous adipose tissue of 87 offspring of Finnish patients with type 2 diabetes did not differ among the genotype groups of SNPs of PPARD. We conclude that SNPs in PPARD modify the conversion from IGT to type 2 diabetes, particularly in combination with the SNPs of PGC-1A and PPARG2.

TI	Assessment of the role of common genetic variation in the transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM) region in type 2 diabetes: a comparative genomic and tagging single nucleotide polymorphism approach.
PG	2272-6
AB	Recent evidence supports the strong overlap between genes implicated in monogenic diabetes and susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. Transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM) is a rare disorder associated with overexpression of genes at a paternally expressed imprinted locus on chromosome 6q24. There are two overlapping genes in this region: the transcription factor zinc finger protein associated with cell cycle control and apoptosis (ZAC also known as PLAGL1) and HYMA1, which encodes an untranslated mRNA. Several type 2 diabetes linkage studies have reported linkage to chromosome 6q22-25. We hypothesized that common genetic variation at this TNDM region influences type 2 diabetes susceptibility. In addition to the coding regions, we used comparative genomic analysis to identify conserved noncoding regions, which were resequenced for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery in 47 individuals. Twenty-six SNPs were identified. Fifteen tag SNPs (tSNPs) were successfully genotyped in a large case-control (n = 3,594) and family-based (n = 1,654) study. We did not find any evidence of association or overtransmission of any tSNP to affected offspring or of a parent-of-origin effect. Using a study sufficiently powered to detect odds ratios of &lt;1.2, we conclude that common variation in the TNDM region does not play an important role in the genetic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes.

TI	Nutritional epigenomics of metabolic syndrome: new perspective against the epidemic.
PG	1899-906
AB	Human epidemiological studies and appropriately designed dietary interventions in animal models have provided considerable evidence to suggest that maternal nutritional imbalance and metabolic disturbances, during critical time windows of development, may have a persistent effect on the health of the offspring and may even be transmitted to the next generation. We now need to explain the mechanisms involved in generating such responses. The idea that epigenetic changes associated with chromatin remodeling and regulation of gene expression underlie the developmental programming of metabolic syndrome is gaining acceptance. Epigenetic alterations have been known to be of importance in cancer for approximately 2 decades. This has made it possible to decipher epigenetic codes and machinery and has led to the development of a new generation of drugs now in clinical trials. Although less conspicuous, epigenetic alterations have also been progressively shown to be relevant to common diseases such as atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes. Imprinted genes, with their key roles in controlling feto-placental nutrient supply and demand and their epigenetic lability in response to nutrients, may play an important role in adaptation/evolution. The combination of these various lines of research on epigenetic programming processes has highlighted new possibilities for the prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome.

TI	Association of non-HLA genes with type 1 diabetes autoimmunity.
PG	2482-6
AB	Approximately 50% of the genetic risk for type 1 diabetes is attributable to the HLA region. We evaluated associations between candidate genes outside the HLA region-INS, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen (CTLA)-4, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-4R, and IL-13 and islet autoimmunity among children participating in the Diabetes Autoimmunity Study in the Young (DAISY). Children with persistent islet autoantibody positivity (n = 102, 38 of whom have already developed diabetes) and control subjects (n = 198) were genotyped for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the candidate genes. The INS-23Hph1 polymorphism was significantly associated with both type 1 diabetes (OR = 0.30; 95% CI 0.13-0.69) and persistent islet autoimmunity but in the latter, only in children with the HLA-DR3/4 genotype (0.40; 0.18-0.89). CTLA-4 promoter SNP was significantly associated with type 1 diabetes (3.52; 1.22-10.17) but not with persistent islet autoimmunity. Several SNPs in the IL-4 regulatory pathway appeared to have a predisposing effect for type 1 diabetes. Associations were found between both IL-4R haplotypes and IL-4-IL-13 haplotypes and persistent islet autoimmunity and type 1 diabetes. This study confirms the association between the INS and CTLA-4 loci and type 1 diabetes. Genes involved in the IL-4 regulatory pathway (IL-4, IL-4R, IL-13) may confer susceptibility or protection to type 1 diabetes depending on individual SNPs or specific haplotypes.

TI	Is puberty an accelerator of type 1 diabetes in IL6-174CC females?
PG	1245-8
AB	The pubertal peak in onset of type 1 diabetes occurs earlier in girls than boys. We postulated that this sex difference might be mediated in part by estrogen or by genes regulated by estrogen, such as the interleukin-6 (IL6) gene. Previous studies concerning the role of an estrogen-sensitive single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the IL6 promoter in type 1 diabetes have proved contradictory. We therefore selected a large, genetically homogenous population-based cohort, analyzed by age at onset and sex, to test the hypothesis that the IL6-174G&gt;C SNP affects age at onset of type 1 diabetes in females but not in males. We found that the IL6-174CC genotype was significantly less frequent in females diagnosed after than in those diagnosed before the age of 10 years (19 vs. 13%, P = 0.016). No genotype difference was observed in males stratified for age at onset. Among children diagnosed after age 10, the median age of onset was 11.9 years (intraquartile range 10.7-14.6) in 34 girls homozygous for IL6-174C compared with 13.2 years (11.6-15.4) in 229 girls with other genotypes and 13.5 years (12.0-15.6) in 339 males with any IL6-174 genotype (P = 0.012). These data support the hypothesis that pubertal changes may contribute to accelerated onset of type 1 diabetes in genetically susceptible females. This phenomenon may be orchestrated by the action of estrogen on the IL6 promoter.

TI	Permanent neonatal diabetes due to mutations in KCNJ11 encoding Kir6.2: patient characteristics and initial response to sulfonylurea therapy.
PG	2713-8
AB	Permanent neonatal diabetes (PND) can be caused by mutations in the transcription factors insulin promoter factor (IPF)-1, eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2alpha kinase 3 (EIF2AK3), and forkhead box-P3 and in key components of insulin secretion: glucokinase (GCK) and the ATP-sensitive K(+) channel subunit Kir6.2. We sequenced the gene encoding Kir6.2 (KCNJ11) in 11 probands with GCK-negative PND. Heterozygous mutations were identified in seven probands, causing three novel (F35V, Y330C, and F333I) and two known (V59M and R201H) Kir6.2 amino acid substitutions. Only two probands had a family history of diabetes. Subjects with the V59M mutation had neurological features including motor delay. Three mutation carriers tested had an insulin secretory response to tolbutamide, but not to glucose or glucagon. Glibenclamide was introduced in increasing doses to investigate whether sulfonylurea could replace insulin. At a glibenclamide dose of 0.3-0.4 mg. kg(-1). day(-1), insulin was discontinued. Blood glucose did not deteriorate, and HbA(1c) was stable or fell during 2-6 months of follow-up. An oral glucose tolerance test performed in one subject revealed that glucose-stimulated insulin release was restored. Mutations in Kir6.2 were the most frequent cause of PND in our cohort. Apparently insulin-dependent patients with mutations in Kir6.2 may be managed on an oral sulfonylurea with sustained metabolic control rather than insulin injections, illustrating the principle of pharmacogenetics applied in diabetes treatment.

TI	Analysis of the type 2 diabetes-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms in the genes IRS1, KCNJ11, and PPARG2 in type 1 diabetes.
PG	870-3
AB	It has been proposed that type 1 and 2 diabetes might share common pathophysiological pathways and, to some extent, genetic background. However, to date there has been no convincing data to establish a molecular genetic link between them. We have genotyped three single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with type 2 diabetes in a large type 1 diabetic family collection of European descent: Gly972Arg in the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) gene, Glu23Lys in the potassium inwardly-rectifying channel gene (KCNJ11), and Pro12Ala in the peroxisome proliferative-activated receptor gamma2 gene (PPARG2). We were unable to confirm a recently published association of the IRS1 Gly972Arg variant with type 1 diabetes. Moreover, KCNJ11 Glu23Lys showed no association with type 1 diabetes (P &gt; 0.05). However, the PPARG2 Pro12Ala variant showed evidence of association (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.04-1.28, P = 0.008). Additional studies need to be conducted to confirm this result.

TI	Variation at the insulin gene VNTR (variable number tandem repeat) polymorphism and early growth: studies in a large Finnish birth cohort.
PG	2126-31
AB	Variation at the insulin gene (INS-)VNTR (variable number of tandem repeats) minisatellite polymorphism has been reported to be associated with both early growth and adult metabolic phenotypes. However, the samples studied have been small and the relationship between INS-VNTR variation and parameters of early growth inconsistent, with four previous studies producing conflicting results. We have studied the relationship between INS-VNTR class (measured by genotyping the nearby -23HphI variant with which it is in tight linkage disequilibrium) and early growth in 5,646 members of the Northern Finnish Birth Cohort of 1966. Comparing class III homozygotes with other genotypes using multivariate linear regression analysis, we found no significant associations with any early growth measure (birth weight, birth length, ponderal index, and head circumference at 1 year), even after stratifying subjects by growth trajectory during infancy and/or birth order. For example, among infants with limited postnatal growth realignment (n = 2,470), class III/III infants were no heavier at birth (difference [+/-SE] in the means [fully adjusted], 58 +/	51 g; P = 0.26) than class I/	infants. No significant associations were detected following reanalysis with an additive model (for example, for birth weight, beta = 20 g [95% CI -3 to 44], P = 0.09). Studies of this large population-based cohort have failed to generate convincing evidence that INS-VNTR variation influences early growth.

TI	Maternal-fetal interactions and birth order influence insulin variable number of tandem repeats allele class associations with head size at birth and childhood weight gain.
PG	1128-33
AB	Polymorphism of the insulin gene (INS) variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR; class I or class III alleles) locus has been associated with adult diseases and with birth size. Therefore, this variant is a potential contributory factor to the reported fetal origins of adult disease. In the population-based Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood birth cohort, we have confirmed in the present study the association between the INS VNTR III/III genotype and larger head circumference at birth (odds ratio [OR] 1.92, 95% CI 1.23-3.07; P = 0.004) and identified an association with higher cord blood IGF-II levels (P = 0.05 to 0.0001). The genotype association with head circumference was influenced by maternal parity (birth order): the III/III OR for larger head circumference was stronger in second and subsequent pregnancies (OR 5.0, 95% CI 2.2-11.5; P = 0.00003) than in first pregnancies (1.2, 0.6-2.2; P = 0.8; interaction with birth order, P = 0.02). During childhood, the III/III genotype remained associated with larger head circumference (P = 0.004) and was also associated with greater BMI (P = 0.03), waist circumference (P = 0.03), and higher fasting insulin levels in girls (P = 0.02). In addition, there were interactions between INS VNTR genotype and early postnatal weight gain in determining childhood BMI (P = 0.001 for interaction), weight (P = 0.005), and waist circumference (P = 0.0005), such that in the approximately 25% of children (n = 286) with rapid early postnatal weight gain, class III genotype-negative children among this group gained weight more rapidly. Our results indicate that complex prenatal and postnatal gene-maternal/fetal interactions influence size at birth and childhood risk factors for adult disease.

TI	The insulin gene variable number tandem repeat class I/III polymorphism is in linkage disequilibrium with birth weight but not Type 2 diabetes in the Pima population.
PG	187-93
AB	The insulin gene variable number tandem repeat (INS-VNTR) is proposed to exert pleiotropic genetic effects on birth weight and diabetes susceptibility. In our study, we examined the influence of a polymorphism in tight linkage disequilibrium with INS-VNTR (-23Hph1) on birth weight and type 2 diabetes in the Pima population. A parent-offspring &quot;trio&quot; design was used to assess parent-of-origin effects and population stratification. The presence of the -23Hph1 T-allele was associated with lower birth weight (n = 192; -140 g per copy of the T-allele; P = 0.04), even after adjustment for effects of population stratification (P = 0.03). The effects of paternally transmitted T-alleles were greater than those of maternally transmitted alleles (paternally transmitted: -250 g, P = 0.05; maternally transmitted: -111 g, P = 0.43), but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.50). The -23Hph1 T-allele was associated with an increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes (P = 0.009), which family-based association analysis suggested was attributable to population structure (P = 0.04) without significant evidence of linkage disequilibrium between diabetes prevalence and genotype (P = 0.86). Thus allelic variation of the INS gene is associated with lower birth weight and increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes. Significant linkage disequilibrium was found between -23Hph1 and birth weight but not type 2 diabetes, an observation that supports a potential functional role of INS polymorphisms in the regulation of birth weight.

TI	Large-scale association studies of variants in genes encoding the pancreatic beta-cell KATP channel subunits Kir6.2 (KCNJ11) and SUR1 (ABCC8) confirm that the KCNJ11 E23K variant is associated with type 2 diabetes.
PG	568-72
AB	The genes ABCC8 and KCNJ11, which encode the subunits sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) and inwardly rectifying potassium channel (Kir6.2) of the beta-cell ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel, control insulin secretion. Common polymorphisms in these genes (ABCC8 exon 16-3t/c, exon 18 T/C, KCNJ11 E23K) have been variably associated with type 2 diabetes, but no large ( approximately 2,000 subjects) case-control studies have been performed. We evaluated the role of these three variants by studying 2,486 U.K. subjects: 854 with type 2 diabetes, 1,182 population control subjects, and 150 parent-offspring type 2 diabetic trios. The E23K allele was associated with diabetes in the case-control study (odds ratio [OR] 1.18 [95% CI 1.04-1.34], P = 0.01) but did not show familial association with diabetes. Neither the exon 16 nor the exon 18 ABCC8 variants were associated with diabetes (1.04 [0.91-1.18], P = 0.57; 0.93 [0.71-1.23], P = 0.63, respectively). Meta-analysis of all case-control data showed that the E23K allele was associated with type 2 diabetes (K allele OR 1.23 [1.12-1.36], P = 0.000015; KK genotype 1.65 [1.34-2.02], P = 0.000002); but the ABCC8 variants were not associated. Our results confirm that E23K increases risk of type 2 diabetes and show that large-scale association studies are important for the identification of diabetes susceptibility alleles.

TI	Insulin secretory function is impaired in isolated human islets carrying the Gly(972)--&gt;Arg IRS-1 polymorphism.
PG	1419-24
AB	Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes results from decreased insulin action in peripheral target tissues (insulin resistance) and impaired pancreatic beta-cell function. These defects reflect both genetic components and environmental risk factors. Recently, the common Gly(972)--&gt;Arg amino acid polymorphism of insulin receptor substrate 1 (Arg(972) IRS-1) has been associated with human type 2 diabetes. In this study, we report on some functional and morphological properties of isolated human islets carrying the Arg(972) IRS-1 polymorphism. Insulin content was lower in variant than control islets (94 +/	47 vs. 133 +/	56 microU/islet; P &lt; 0.05). Stepwise glucose increase (1.7 to 16.7 mmol/l) significantly potentiated insulin secretion from control islets, but not Arg(972) IRS-1 islets, with the latter also showing a relatively lower response to glyburide and a significantly higher response to arginine. Proinsulin release mirrored insulin secretion, and the insulin-to-proinsulin ratio in response to arginine was significantly lower from Arg(972) IRS-1 islets than from control islets. Glucose utilization and oxidation did not differ in variant and wild-type islets at both low and high glucose levels. Electron microscopy showed that Arg(972) IRS-1 beta-cells had a severalfold greater number of immature secretory granules and a lower number of mature granules than control beta-cells. In conclusion, Arg(972) IRS-1 islets have reduced insulin content, impaired insulin secretion, and a lower amount of mature secretory granules. These alterations may account for the increased predisposition to type 2 diabetes in individuals carrying the Gly(972)--&gt;Arg amino acid polymorphism of IRS-1.

TI	Lamin A/C gene: sex-determined expression of mutations in Dunnigan-type familial partial lipodystrophy and absence of coding mutations in congenital and acquired generalized lipoatrophy.
PG	1958-62
AB	Missense mutations of the lamin A/C gene, LMNA, have been recently identified in Dunnigan-type familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD), which belongs to a heterogeneous group of rare disorders affecting adipose tissue distribution and metabolism. In this study, we sequenced the LMNA coding region from patients presenting with FPLD or other forms of lipodystrophy. We identified two heterozygous mutations in exon 8, R482W and R482Q, in FPLD patients (six families and one individual) with various clinical presentations. In addition, we found a novel heterozygous mutation (R584H) in exon 11, encoding specifically the lamin A isoform, in a patient with typical FPLD. Clinical and biochemical investigations in FPLD patients revealed that the expression and the severity of the phenotype were markedly dependent on sex, with female patients being more markedly affected. In subjects with generalized lipoatrophy, either congenital (13 case subjects) or acquired (14 case subjects), or Barraquer-Simon syndrome (2 case subjects), the entire LMNA coding sequence was normal. Although FPLD mutations are predominantly localized in exon 8 of LMNA, the finding of a novel mutation at codon 584, together with the R582H heterozygous substitution recently described, confirms that the C-terminal region specific to the lamin A isoform is a second susceptibility region for mutations in FPLD.

TI	Analysis of parent-offspring trios provides evidence for linkage and association between the insulin gene and type 2 diabetes mediated exclusively through paternally transmitted class III variable number tandem repeat alleles.
PG	126-30
AB	Variation at the variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) minisatellite 5' of the insulin gene (INS) is associated with several phenotypes, including type 1 diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome, and birth weight. Case-control studies have suggested that class III VNTR alleles are also associated with type 2 diabetes, but results have been inconsistent and may reflect population stratification. To explore further the role of the INS-VNTR in type 2 diabetes susceptibility, we used family-based association methods in 155 parent-offspring trios from the British Diabetic Association-Warren Trios repository, each ascertained via a Europid proband with type 2 diabetes. Overall, there was no significant association between diabetes and the INS-VNTR genotype, with 65 of 119 heterozygous parents (55%) transmitting class III and 54 class I (P = 0.16, one-sided). However, whereas maternal transmissions followed Mendelian expectation, there was a marked excess of class III transmission from the 49 heterozygous fathers (34 [69%] vs. 15, P = 0.003 vs. 50% expectation, P = 0.003 vs. maternal transmission). These results confirm that variation within the TH-INS-IGF2 locus, most plausibly at the VNTR itself, influences type 2 diabetes susceptibility. By demonstrating that this effect is mediated exclusively by the paternally derived allele, these findings implicate imprinted genes in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.

TI	Refinement of the 6q chromosomal region implicated in transient neonatal diabetes.
PG	108-13
AB	Transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM) is estimated to occur in approximately 1 in 500,000 births and represents 50-60% of cases of neonatal diabetes. The pattern of inheritance of TNDM and its association with chromosome 6 uniparental disomy is consistent with the presence on chromosome 6 of an imprinted gene involved in pancreatic beta-cell development. Systematic screening for chromosome 6 abnormalities in nine families with 13 individuals affected by TNDM revealed paternal isodisomy of chromosome 6 in one child and paternally derived trisomy of the chromosomal region 6q in six children from three unrelated families. To delineate more accurately the region suspected of harboring the gene of interest, precise mapping of the duplicated area was performed in children exhibiting partial 6q trisomy by using microsatellite markers. The smallest region of duplication observed in our patients was flanked by markers D6S308 and D6S1010, which are separated by &lt;1 cM. These findings confirm that TNDM may result from the overexpression of a gene located on chromosome 6q that is exclusively expressed from the paternal allele at least during some periods of life and further refine the localization of this gene.

TI	A common promoter variant of the leptin gene is associated with changes in the relationship between serum leptin and fat mass in obese girls.
PG	2196-200
AB	Mutations in the leptin gene lead to rare obese syndromes of Mendelian inheritance in humans and rodents. However, no relevant mutations are found in the coding region of leptin gene DNA in patients with common multifactorial obesity. These obese patients tend to have an elevation of serum leptin proportional to their adiposity but with a rather wide dispersion of leptin levels for a given body fat content, which in part is attributable to sexual dimorphism. The current study, performed in two independent Caucasian cohorts of obese girls, shows that a frequent promoter variant of the leptin gene is associated with changes in the relationship between serum leptin and body fatness. Girls of comparable adiposity have different circulating leptin levels, depending on their genotype at this locus. Girls with the -/	Lep -2,549 genotype have 25% lower mean leptin levels than the girls with other genotypes, as reflected by differences in the regression slopes of leptin-to-fat mass. Therefore, genetic factors related to the leptin gene may be important in defining the set point of obese individuals (i.e., the circulating leptin level for a given degree of body fatness). This definition may be of both physiological and therapeutic relevance, although a phenotypic association with an individual single-nucleotide polymorphism is not sufficient to assign function to this particular nucleotide site.

TI	Transient neonatal diabetes: widening the understanding of the etiopathogenesis of diabetes.
PG	1359-66
AB	Transient neonatal diabetes (TND) is a rare type of diabetes that presents soon after birth, resolves by 18 months, and predisposes to diabetes later in life. A total of 30 patients were ascertained and investigated for aberrations of chromosome 6. A genotype/phenotype study was also performed. Genotypically, these patients can be classified into 4 etiologic groups. Group 1 had paternal uniparental isodisomy of chromosome 6 (11 cases, including 1 set of identical twins). Group 2 had a duplication involving chromosome band 6q24, which was paternal in origin where tested (4 sporadic cases and 7 familial cases from 2 families). Group 3 consisted of 1 patient with a loss of methylation at a CpG island within the TND critical region (1 sporadic case). Group 4 had no identifiable rearrangement of chromosome 6 (7 sporadic cases). Most patients were growth retarded at birth, presented at a median age of 3 days, and recovered at a median age of 12 weeks. In group 2, 2 relatives of the TND patients who presented with type 2 diabetes and no early history of TND had inherited an identical duplication. An abnormality of chromosome 6 was identified in approximately 70% of sporadic TND cases and in all familial cases. No significant clinical differences were found between the 4 etiological groups. The study has broadened the clinical spectrum of TND to include type 2 diabetes presenting in later life with no neonatal presentation. The findings are consistent with an imprinted gene for diabetes mapping to 6q24, which we predict will have an important function in normal pancreatic development.

TI	Beta-cell proliferation and apoptosis in the developing normal human pancreas and in hyperinsulinism of infancy.
PG	1325-33
AB	Hyperinsulinism of infancy (HI), also known as persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy, is a rare genetic disorder that occurs in approximately 1 of 50,000 live births. Histologically, pancreases from HI patients can be divided into 2 major groups. In the first, diffuse HI, beta-cell distribution is similar to that seen in normal neonatal pancreas, whereas in the second, focal HI, there is a discrete region of beta-cell adenomatous hyperplasia. In most patients, the clinical course of the disease suggests a slow progressive loss of beta-cell function. Using double immunostaining, we examined the proportion of beta-cells undergoing proliferation and apoptosis during the development of the normal human pancreas and in pancreases from diffuse and focal HI patients. In the control samples, our findings show a progressive decrease in beta-cell proliferation from 3.2 +/	0.5% between 17 and 32 weeks of gestation to 0.13 +/	0.08% after 6 months of age. In contrast, frequency of apoptosis is low (0.6 +/	0.2%) in weeks 17-32 of gestation, elevated (1.3 +/	0.3% ) during the perinatal period, and again low (0.08 +/	0.3%) after 6 months of age. HI beta-cells showed an increased frequency of proliferation, with focal lesions showing particularly high levels. Similarly, the proportion of apoptotic cells was increased in HI, although this reached statistical significance only after 3 months of age. In conclusion, we demonstrated that islet remodeling normally seen in the neonatal period may be primarily due to a wave of beta-cell apoptosis that occurs at that time. In HI, our findings of persistently increased beta-cell proliferation and apoptosis provide a possible mechanism to explain the histologic picture seen in diffuse disease. The slow progressive decrease in insulin secretion seen clinically in these patients suggests that the net effect of these phenomena may be loss of beta-cell mass.

TI	Autoantibody appearance and risk for development of childhood diabetes in offspring of parents with type 1 diabetes: the 2-year analysis of the German BABYDIAB Study.
PG	460-8
AB	The temporal development of autoantibodies was studied in 1,353 offspring of parents with type 1 diabetes. Islet cell antibodies (ICAs) and autoantibodies to insulin (IAAs), glutamic acid decarboxylase, and IA-2 were measured at birth, 9 months, 2 years, and 5 years of age. At birth, no offspring had islet autoimmunity other than maternally acquired antibodies, which were shown to influence antibody prevalence up to age 6 months. Antibodies detected thereafter were likely to represent a true de novo production, since prevalences were the same for offspring from mothers and fathers with diabetes, antibodies detected at 9 months were almost always confirmed in the 2-year sample and were associated with an increased likelihood of having or developing other antibodies. By 2 years of age, autoantibodies appeared in 11% of offspring, 3.5% having more than one autoantibody. IAAs were detected most frequently, and few had autoantibodies in the absence of IAAs. In 23 offspring with multiple islet autoantibodies, IAAs preceded other antibodies in 10 cases and were first detected concurrently with other antibodies in 12 and after detection of other antibodies in 1. Development of additional antibodies and changes in levels, including decline of IAAs at older age, was frequent. Nine children, all with IAAs and ICAs, developed diabetes. Overall cumulative risk for disease by 5 years of age was 1.8% (95% CI 0.2-3.4) and was 50% (95% CI 19-81) for offspring with more than one autoantibody in their 2-year sample. Autoimmunity associated with childhood diabetes is an early event and a dynamic process. Presence of IAAs is a consistent feature of this autoimmunity, and IAA detection can identify children at risk.

TI	Triglyceride-induced diabetes associated with familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency.
PG	1258-63
AB	Raised plasma triglycerides (TGs) and nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of insulin-resistant diabetes. We report on two sisters with extreme hypertriglyceridemia and overt diabetes, in whom surgical normalization of TGs cured the diabetes. In all of the family members (parents, two affected sisters, ages 18 and 15 years, and an 11-year-old unaffected sister), we measured oral glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity (by the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp technique), substrate oxidation (indirect calorimetry), endogenous glucose production (by the [6,6-2H2]glucose technique), and postheparin plasma lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity. In addition, GC-clamped polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA from the promoter region and the 10 coding LPL gene exons were screened for nucleotide substitution. Two silent mutations were found in the father's exon 4 (Glu118 Glu) and in the mother's exon 8 (Thr361 Thr), while a nonsense mutation (Ser447 Ter) was detected in the mother's exon 9. Mutations in exons 4 and 8 were inherited by the two affected girls. At 1-2 years after the appearance of hyperchylomicronemia, both sisters developed hyperglycemia with severe insulin resistance. Because medical therapy (including high-dose insulin) failed to reduce plasma TGs or control glycemia, lipid malabsorption was surgically induced by a modified biliopancreatic diversion. Within 3 weeks of surgery, plasma TGs and NEFA and cholesterol levels were drastically lowered. Concurrently, fasting plasma glucose levels fell from 17 to 5 mmol/l (with no therapy), while insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, oxidation, and storage were all markedly improved. Throughout the observation period, plasma TG levels were closely correlated with both plasma glucose and insulin concentrations, as measured during the oral glucose tolerance test. These cases provide evidence that insulin-resistant diabetes can be caused by extremely high levels of TGs.

TI	Intrauterine diabetes exposure and the risk of renal disease in diabetic Pima Indians.
PG	1489-93
AB	The association between the diabetic intrauterine environment and renal disease was examined cross-sectionally in 503 Pima Indians with type 2 diabetes. Subjects were selected from participants in an ongoing study of diabetes and its complications in the Gila River Indian Community of Arizona. Subjects' exposure to diabetes in utero was established from periodic examinations conducted as part of the study. The prevalence of elevated urinary albumin excretion (UAE) (albumin-to-creatinine ratio &gt; or = 30 mg/g) was 40% (83 of 207) in the offspring of nondiabetic mothers, 43% (105 of 246) in the offspring of prediabetic mothers (i.e., women who were not diabetic at the time of the pregnancy but who developed diabetes after the pregnancy), and 58% (29 of 50) in the offspring of mothers who had diabetes during pregnancy. After controlling for age, sex, duration of diabetes, HbA1c, and mean arterial pressure in the offspring in a logistic regression analysis using generalized estimating equations, maternal diabetes during pregnancy was strongly associated with elevated UAE. The odds of elevated UAE in the offspring of mothers who had diabetes during pregnancy was 3.8 times (95% CI 1.7-8.4) that of the offspring of prediabetic mothers; the odds of elevated UAE in the offspring of nondiabetic and prediabetic mothers were similar (odds ratio of 0.94; 95% CI 0.59-1.5). We concluded that exposure to a diabetic intrauterine environment increases the risk of elevated UAE in diabetic Pima Indians. The effect of this exposure appears to be independent of other susceptibility factors that lead to nephropathy in diabetes.

TI	Clinical phenotypes, insulin secretion, and insulin sensitivity in kindreds with maternally inherited diabetes and deafness due to mitochondrial tRNALeu(UUR) gene mutation.
PG	478-87
AB	An A-to-G transition in the mitochondrial tRNALeu(UUR) gene at base pair 3243 has been shown to be associated with the maternally transmitted clinical phenotype of NIDDM and sensorineural hearing loss in white and Japanese pedigrees. We have detected this mutation in 25 of 50 tested members of five white French pedigrees. Affected (mutation-positive) family members presented variable clinical features, ranging from normal glucose tolerance (NGT) to insulin-requiring diabetes. The present report describes the clinical phenotypes of affected members and detailed evaluations of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity in seven mutation-positive individuals who have a range of glucose tolerance from normal (n = 3) to impaired (n = 1) to NIDDM (n = 3). Insulin secretion was evaluated during two experimental protocols: the first involved the measurement of insulin secretory responses during intravenous glucose tolerance test, hyperglycemic clamp, and intravenous injection of arginine. The second consisted of the administration of graded and oscillatory infusions of glucose and studies to define C-peptide kinetics. This protocol was aimed at assessing two sensitive measures of beta-cell dysfunction: the priming effect of glucose on the glucose-insulin secretion rate (ISR) dose-response curve and the ability of oscillatory glucose infusion to entrain insulin secretory oscillations. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp. Evaluation of insulin secretion demonstrated a large degree of between	and within-subject variability. However, all subjects, including those with NGT, demonstrated abnormal insulin secretion on at least one of the tests. In the four subjects with normal or impaired glucose tolerance, glucose failed to prime the ISR response, entrainment of ultradian insulin secretory oscillations was abnormal, or both defects were present. The response to arginine was always preserved, including in subjects with NIDDM. Insulin resistance was observed only in the subjects with overt diabetes. In conclusion, the pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for the development of NIDDM and insulin-requiring diabetes in this syndrome are complex and might include defects in insulin production, glucose toxicity, and insulin resistance. However, our data suggest that a defect of glucose-regulated insulin secretion is an early possible primary abnormality in carriers of the mutation. This defect might result from the progressive reduction of oxidative phosphorylation and implicate the glucose-sensing mechanism of beta-cells.

TI	Insulin gene 5' flanking polymorphism. Length of class 1 alleles in number of repeat units.
PG	1296-302
AB	The 5' flanking polymorphism (5'FP) is a minisatellite, variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) locus adjacent to the 5' end of the insulin gene (INS). Alleles of the 5'FP are highly variable in length but fall into three discrete size classes. The shortest, or class 1, alleles are associated with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Here we present a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based technique for subtyping 5'FP class 1 alleles by determining their exact lengths in number of repeat units (RUs). The technique resolves small length differences not detectable by Southern blot and produces a frequency distribution of class 1 allele lengths, which serve as subtypes of the crude class 1 category. We have applied the technique to 132 Caucasian families with IDDM offspring and have found that the lengths of 5'FP class 1 alleles form a quasi-continuous distribution with three distinct modes. We also found precise correlation between class 1 allele length and the allele present on the same chromosome at HUMTH01, a second VNTR locus in the INS region. Specifically, each of the four common alleles of HUMTH01 exhibited near-total association with a narrow size range belonging to one of the three components of the class 1 distribution. We discuss these results in relation to the population history of the 5'FP and INS region haplotypes and in relation to IDDM susceptibility in the INS region.

TI	5' insulin gene polymorphism confers risk to IDDM independently of HLA class II susceptibility.
PG	851-4
AB	The polymorphic variable number of tandem repeats in the 5' upstream region of the human insulin gene is a well-known non-human leukocyte antigen locus contributing to genetic susceptibility to IDDM. Controversy exists about the question as to whether INS susceptibility haplotypes are or are not preferentially inherited together with HLA-DR4 haplotypes. We investigated whether genetic interaction between INS and the HLA complex can be better defined using DQ genotypic and phenotypic markers in addition to DR serology. The 5' INS 1/1 genotype was positively associated with IDDM both in non-DR4 subjects (relative risk = 4.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-11.5) and DR4 subjects (relative risk = 4.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.9-9.0). Further subdivision of IDDM patients and matched control subjects according to HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genotype or phenotype also failed to show any association between 5' INS and HLA class II genes in diabetic patients. The 5' INS and HLA class II polymorphisms therefore provide independent risk markers, which may both contribute to the genetic screening of a high-risk population among nondiabetic individuals.

TI	Leptin gene epigenetic adaptation to impaired glucose metabolism during pregnancy.
PG	2436-41
AB	OBJECTIVE: To verify whether the leptin gene epigenetic (DNA methylation) profile is altered in the offspring of mothers with gestational impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Placental tissues and maternal and cord blood samples were obtained from 48 women at term including 23 subjects with gestational IGT. Leptin DNA methylation, gene expression levels, and circulating concentration were measured using the Sequenom EpiTYPER system, quantitative real-time RT-PCR, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. IGT was assessed after a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 24-28 weeks of gestation. RESULTS: We have shown that placental leptin gene DNA methylation levels were correlated with glucose levels (2-h post-OGTT) in women with IGT (fetal side: rho=-0.44, P&lt;/=0.05; maternal side: rho=0.53, P&lt;/=0.01) and with decreased leptin gene expression (n=48; rho&gt;/=-0.30, P&lt;/=0.05) in the whole cohort. Placental leptin mRNA levels accounted for 16% of the variance in maternal circulating leptin concentration (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: IGT during pregnancy was associated with leptin gene DNA methylation adaptations with potential functional impacts. These epigenetic changes provide novel mechanisms that could contribute to explaining the detrimental health effects associated with fetal programming, such as long-term increased risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes.

TI	NOS3 polymorphisms are associated with arterial stiffness in children with type 1 diabetes.
PG	689-93
AB	OBJECTIVE: Type 1 diabetes is associated with endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffness, and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. We previously demonstrated increased arterial stiffness in children with type 1 diabetes compared with control subjects. However, traditional CVD risk factors did not explain the difference in arterial stiffness. Furthermore, children with type 1 diabetes displayed notable within-group variation in arterial stiffness. We hypothesized that polymorphisms in the NOS3 gene may be associated with the differences seen in arterial stiffness within the population of children with type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirty-six consecutively enrolled subjects aged 10-21 years with type 1 diabetes were studied. Subjects underwent radial tonometry in a fasting state. A corrected augmentation index (AI75) was the primary measure of arterial stiffness. Genotypes were determined for the NOS3 -786T--&gt;C and Glu298--&gt;Asp polymorphisms by pyrosequencing. AI75 values by genotype groups were compared by ANOVA and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Median (interquartile range) AI75 values for -786TT and -786C carriers were -3.5 (-8.8 to 2.3) and 11.0 (6.0 to 14.4), respectively (P = 0.01); AI75 values for Glu298Glu patients and Asp298 carriers were 2.3 (-4.0 to 13.0) and 7.3 (-2.0 to 11.5), respectively (P = 0.59). In univariate analysis, age, sex, BMI percentile, and -786T--&gt;C genotype were significantly associated with AI75. The multivariate model, which included these four variables, was significantly associated with AI75 (P = 0.002, R2 = 0.40). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported association between -786T--&gt;C and arterial stiffness in type 1 diabetes. Larger studies are needed to confirm this observation for potential translation to risk assessment.

TI	Phenotype-genotype correlations in a series of wolfram syndrome families.
PG	2003-9
AB	OBJECTIVE: Wolfram syndrome is an extremely rare autosomal-recessive disorder that predisposes the development of type 1 diabetes in association with progressive optic atrophy. The genetic basis of this disease has been shown to be due to mutations in the WFS1 gene. The WFS1 gene encodes a novel transmembrane protein called wolframin, which recent evidence suggests may serve as a novel endoplasmic reticulum calcium channel in pancreatic beta-cells and neurons. Genotype-phenotype correlations in this syndrome are becoming apparent and may help in explaining some of the variable characteristics observed in this disease. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this report, we have studied 13 patients with Wolfram syndrome from nine families to further define the relationship between mutation site and type with specific disease characteristics. RESULTS: A severe phenotype was seen in patients with mutations in exon 4 and with a large deletion encompassing most of exon 8. In total, nine novel mutations were identified as well as three new silent polymorphisms. CONCLUSIONS: Similar to all other mutation reports, most causative changes identified in the WFS1 gene occurred in exon 8, and only one was identified outside this region in exon 4.

TI	Determinants of the development of diabetes (maturity-onset diabetes of the young-3) in carriers of HNF-1alpha mutations: evidence for parent-of-origin effect.
PG	2292-301
AB	OBJECTIVE: To determine the distribution of the age at onset of diabetes (maturity-onset diabetes of the young-3 [MODY3]) and to identify determinants of the onset of diabetes in carriers of HNF-1alpha mutations. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Extended families (n = 104) with type 2 diabetes inherited in a dominant pattern were recruited and screened for diabetes-causing mutations in HNF-1alpha. RESULTS: HNF-1alpha mutations cosegregated with diabetes in only 13 families, all with a mean age at onset &lt;35 years. Insulin secretion was diminished or absent in mutation carriers (n = 101), and diabetes developed in 65% by age 25 years and in 100% by age 50 years. If the mutation was inherited from the mother, diabetes onset was very young in those exposed to diabetes in utero; 57 +/	8% were affected by age 15 years as compared with 0.0% in those not exposed (P &lt; 7 x 10(-6)). By age 25 years, the difference was reduced (85 +/	6 and 55 +/	12%, respectively; P = 0.02). If the mutation was inherited from the father, diabetes developed in 52 +/	8% by age 25 years. Age at diagnosis was shown to be highly heritable (h(2) = 0.47, P = 0.003). When parent of origin was included in the analyses, the magnitude of genetic contribution increased markedly (h(2) = 0.91). CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in HNF-1alpha accounts for diabetes in a small proportion of families with a dominant pattern of inheritance. Age at onset of diabetes in MODY3 families varied widely and was influenced by familial factors (including modifying genes) and parent of origin (whether a mutation carrier was exposed to diabetes in utero).

TI	Intrauterine hyperglycemia is associated with an earlier diagnosis of diabetes in HNF-1alpha gene mutation carriers.
PG	2287-91
AB	OBJECTIVE: In animals, experimentally induced maternal hyperglycemia during pregnancy results in hyperglycemic offspring. Similarly, Pima Indian offspring with mothers who are diabetic at the time of pregnancy have increased risk of early-onset diabetes. We hypothesized that exposure to hyperglycemia in utero would decrease the age at diagnosis of diabetes in patients with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) due to a mutation in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF-1alpha) gene. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed the affect of maternal diabetes on age at diagnosis of diabetes in 150 HNF-1alpha gene mutation carriers from 55 families. RESULTS: Age at diagnosis in HNF-1alpha mutation carriers was younger when the mother was diagnosed before pregnancy compared with when the mother was diagnosed after pregnancy (15.5 +/	5.4 vs. 27.5 +/	13.1 years, P &lt; 0.0001). This is unlikely to represent a generalized familial decrease in age at diagnosis due to a more severe mutation, because no difference was seen in age of the offspring at diagnosis of diabetes when the father was diagnosed at a young age, and a similar trend was seen when only the single common mutation, P291fsinsC, was analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that maternal hyperglycemia during pregnancy probably increases the penetrance of HNF-1alpha mutations. The potential role of exposure to hyperglycemia in utero in a monogenic diabetic subgroup warrants prospective study.

TI	Factors predicting the age when type 2 diabetes is diagnosed in Hong Kong Chinese subjects.
PG	646-9
AB	OBJECTIVE: To examine the factors predicting age at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in Hong Kong Chinese. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The relationships between age at diagnosis and parental history of diabetes as well as an array of clinical and metabolic factors were examined using a hospital clinic-based diabetes registry involving 3,414 index patients with type 2 diabetes Patterns of age at diagnosis in successive generations were also examined using 21 affected child-parent pairs and 7 affected child-parent-grandparent trios. RESULTS: Approximately 29% of the index patients were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at &lt; or = 35 years of age (hereby defined as early-onset). Compared with the patients diagnosed at &gt;35 years of age (hereby defined as late-onset) the early-onset patients had higher rates of positive paternal (16 vs. 5%) and maternal (22 vs. 12%) history of diabetes (both at P &lt; 0.01) and had poorer metabolic profiles. In the overall index patients, male sex, higher HbA1c waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and systolic blood pressure (sBP); lower HDL cholesterol level; and a positive paternal was well as maternal history of diabetes predicted younger age at diagnosis. More senior age and higher BMI and diastolic blood pressure predicted olderq age at diagnosis. Predictors for younger age at diagnosis in the male patients were higher HbA1c and sBP and a positive paternal history of diabetes Predictors for younger age at diagnosis in the female patients were higher HbA1c WHR, and sBP and a paternal as well as maternal history of diabetes. In the affected child parent pairs and clild-parent-grandparent trios there was a decrease in age at diagnosis in successive generations. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that both familial (possibly genetic) and metabolic factors affect the age of onset of type 2 diabetes in the Chinese population. The results also suggest an onset and progression pattern of the disease that is compatible with the phenomenon of anticipation.

TI	Long-term follow-up of infants of mothers with type 1 diabetes: evidence for hereditary and nonhereditary transmission of diabetes and precursors.
PG	905-11
AB	OBJECTIVE: To estimate the impact of type 1 diabetes during pregnancy on transgenerational genetically caused and/or fuel-mediated amplification of types 1 and 2 diabetes and to estimate the impact of elevated amniotic fluid insulin levels. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 75 white offspring of type 1 diabetic mothers and 49 control subjects of similar age and pubertal stage were examined at 5-15 years of age. All offspring had an oral glucose tolerance test. Glucose, insulin, and C-peptide were measured at 0, 30, 60, and 120 min after loading. Lipids and autoimmune antibodies were measured in fasting plasma. RESULTS: Of the 75 offspring, 4 (5.3%) had overt diabetes, and 16 of 71 (22.5%) had autoimmune antibodies. Offspring of diabetic mothers had significantly higher BMI; symmetry indexes; cholesterol, glucose, insulin, and C-peptide levels; and insulin resistance than control subjects. With the exception of cholesterol, these values were significantly elevated in offspring who had elevated amniotic fluid insulin levels (&gt;8 microU/ml, &gt;48 pmol/l) during pregnancy compared with normoinsulinemic offspring and control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Offspring of type 1 diabetic mothers have an increased risk for diabetes later in life. The relative risk for type 1 and type 2 diabetes is 71.6 and 3.2, respectively. Type 2 diabetes-associated risk factors, such as high BMI; elevated glucose, insulin, and C-peptide levels; and insulin resistance, are related to the fetal metabolic experience in utero, as reflected by amniotic fluid insulin concentration.

TI	Influence of insertion/deletion polymorphism in the ACE-I gene on the progression of diabetic glomerulopathy in type 1 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria.
PG	544-8
AB	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of the insertion/deletion polymorphism of the ACE gene on the progression of early diabetic glomerulopathy in patients with and without antihypertensive treatment (AHT). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: There were 30 microalbuminuric patients with &gt;5 years of type 1 diabetes who had renal biopsies taken at baseline and after 26-48 months of follow-up. Of the 30 patients, 13 (4 with II genotype and 9 with ID and DD genotypes) were randomized to AHT (enalapril or metoprolol) during the study. The ACE genotype was determined by a polymerase chain reaction. Glomerular structural changes were measured by stereological methods. RESULTS: Of the patients, 8 had the II genotype, 19 had ID genotype, and 3 had DD genotype. During the study, basement membrane thickness, matrix star volume, and the overall diabetic glomerulopathy index were increased in patients with ID and DD genotypes only (P &lt; 0.001, P = 0.01, P &lt; 0.001, respectively). Among those with ID and DD genotypes, progression of basement membrane thickening and diabetic glomerulopathy index were increased in those without AHT, as compared with the antihypertensive treated patients (P &lt; 0.001, P = 0.02, respectively). In multivariate analysis, the ACE genotype had an independent influence on the progression of basement membrane thickening (P = 0.01), when AHT (P &lt; 0.001) and the mean HbAlc during the study (P &lt; 0.001) were also taken into account. ACE genotype tended to be independently associated with the diabetic glomerulopathy index (P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Microalbuminuric type 1 diabetic patients carrying the D-allele have an increased progression of diabetic glomerulopathy. Presence of this allele and no AHT seems to enhance this process. Larger studies are needed to confirm the clinical significance of our findings.

TI	Association of ACE gene polymorphism with arterial stiffness in patients with type 2 diabetes.
PG	1858-64
AB	OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between the insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism of the ACE gene and arterial distensibility in patients with type 2 diabetes and healthy control subjects. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Aortic and carotid arterial distensibility were evaluated by measuring aortic pulse-wave velocity (a-PWV) and carotid stiffness beta using an echo-tracking system in 137 patients with type 2 diabetes and 260 age-matched control subjects. RESULTS: a-PWV and carotid stiffness beta were significantly higher in patients with type 2 diabetes than in age-matched control subjects (P &lt; 0.05). Both stiffness beta and a-PWV were significantly higher in the patients with the II genotype than in those with the DD genotype (P &lt; 0.001). In the control subjects, multiple regression analysis showed that age and decreased HDL cholesterol were independently associated with increased a-PWV (R2 = 0.244, P &lt; 0.0001) and that age, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and BMI were independently associated with increased carotid stiffness beta (R2 = 0.454, P &lt; 0.0001). In the patients with type 2 diabetes, age, gene dose of the I allele, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were independently associated with increased a-PWV (R2 = 0.545, P &lt; 0.0001), and age, gene dose of the I allele, and systolic blood pressure were associated with increases in carotid stiffness beta (R2 = 0.314, P &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that ACE polymorphism is associated with the impairment of aortic and carotid distensibility in patients with type 2 diabetes.

TI	Excess maternal transmission of type 2 diabetes. The Northern California Kaiser Permanente Diabetes Registry.
PG	938-43
AB	OBJECTIVE: To assess excess maternal transmission of type 2 diabetes in a multiethnic cohort. Previous studies have reported higher prevalence of diabetes among mothers of probands with type 2 diabetes than among fathers. This analysis is vulnerable to biases, and this pattern has not been observed in all populations or races. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We assessed evidence for excess maternal transmission among 42,533 survey respondents with type 2 diabetes (probands) by calculating the prevalence of diabetes in their siblings and offspring. To assess data quality, we evaluated completeness of family history data provided. Accuracy of family information reported by probands was also evaluated by comparing survey responses in a subsample of 206 probands with family histories modified after further interviews with relatives. RESULTS: Siblings (n = 60,532) of probands with affected mothers had a greater prevalence of diabetes (20%) than those with affected fathers (17%) (P &lt; 0.001 for adjusted odds ratios). Prevalence of diabetes was higher among the offspring (n = 72,087) of female (3.4%) versus male (2.2%) probands (P &lt; 0.001 for adjusted odds ratios). These patterns were evident in all races and both sexes; however, the effect size was clinically insignificant in African-Americans and male offspring. In general, probands provided more complete data about diabetes status for the maternal arm of the pedigree than the paternal arm. Completeness of knowledge was not related to proband sex, but was related to education and race, and inversely to age. Accuracy of proband-reported family history was consistently good (kappa statistics generally &gt; 0.70). CONCLUSIONS: Excess maternal transmission was observed in all races and both sexes, although the size of the excess was negligible in African-Americans and male offspring. Potential reporting and censoring biases are discussed.

TI	Relationship between glomerular hyperfiltration and ACE insertion/deletion polymorphism in type 1 diabetic children and adolescents.
PG	618-22
AB	OBJECTIVE: Glomerular hyperfiltration may predict diabetic nephropathy in type 1 diabetes, and some studies suggest that the ACE D allele is associated with diabetic nephropathy. The aim of this study was to examine a possible relationship between glomerular hyperfiltration and ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism in type 1 diabetic children and adolescents. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted to examine the relationship between glomerular hyperfiltration and ACE (I/D) polymorphism in 76 type 1 diabetic children and adolescents without diabetic nephropathy (mean +/	SD: age 16 +/	3 years; diabetes duration 7 +/	4 years; age at diabetes onset 9 +/	4 years; HbA1c 9.5 +/	1.9%). Glomerular hyperfiltration (defined as a glomerular filtration rate [GFR] &gt; or = 135 ml.min-1. 1.73 m-2 and by 51Cr-labeled EDTA plasma disappearance technique) and ACE I/D genotypes and plasma levels (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] method) were determined. RESULTS: Of the patients, 29 (38%) displayed glomerular hyperfiltration. An association between glomerular hyperfiltration and ACE (I/D) polymorphism was observed (chi 2 = 7.09, P = 0.029) because of a reduced proportion of DD genotypes among patients with glomerular hyperfiltration (4 vs. 19; chi 2 = 6.03, P = 0.014) and not because of an excess of the II genotype (5 vs. 9; chi 2 = 0.04, P = 0.83). Age, diabetes duration, age at diabetes onset, and HbA1c were not different according to genotype. Patients with glomerular hyperfiltration had low plasma ACE levels, compared with those with normal glomerular filtration (457 +/	157 vs. 553 +/	186 micrograms/l; P = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest an unexpected association between glomerular hyperfiltration and ACE (I/D) polymorphism, characterized by a defect of the DD genotype among type 1 diabetic children and adolescents with glomerular hyperfiltration.

TI	Evaluation of the insertion/deletion ACE gene polymorphism as a risk factor for carotid artery intima-media thickening and hypertension in young type 1 diabetic patients.
PG	836-40
AB	OBJECTIVE: To study the distribution of the insertion/deletion polymorphism of the ACE gene in young type 1 diabetic patients and to evaluate possible associations between the ACE genotype, arterial hypertension, and intima-media thickness (IMT) of the common carotid artery. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Study participants were 148 type 1 diabetic patients (56 men and 92 women), aged 14-44 years, with a diabetes duration of &gt; or = 2 years. HbA1c, albuminuria, and lipid status were assessed by standard laboratory techniques; the ACE genotypes were assessed by polymerase chain reaction. The patients were categorized according to the presence or absence of hypertension, nephropathy, and retinopathy. The IMT, which can be used to estimate early stages of atherosclerosis, was measured by high-resolution ultrasonography. RESULTS: The ACE genotypes were distributed as follows: 21% II, 37% ID, 42% DD. The IMT values did not differ among patients with various ACE genotypes (0.63 +/	0.15 mm), but the prevalence of hypertension was significantly higher in patients with DD (odds ratio, 4.26 versus II + ID; 95% CI, 1.64-11.06). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that only age, hypertension, and sex were determinants for the IMT. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a relationship between the prevalence of hypertension and the deletion polymorphism of the ACE gene in young type 1 diabetic patients, but we could not find an association between carotid artery IMT and ACE genotype in this population.

TI	Effect of maternal diabetes on the pattern of selected insulin resistance syndrome parameters in normal glucose tolerant subjects of two Algonquin Indian communities in Quebec.
PG	822-6
AB	OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a maternal antecedent with diabetes has an effect on insulin resistance syndrome parameters. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 352 Algonquin Indians from Quebec aged at least 15 years who had no personal antecedents with diabetes. Data concerned clinical and biological parameters and the parental antecedents with diabetes. RESULTS: For subjects over &gt; 30 years, fasting insulin and cholesterol levels were significantly higher in the group with a maternal history of diabetes than in the group with a paternal history. Significant differences were observed for serum triglyceride, BMI, and subscapular skinfold thickness when comparing subjects with a maternal history and those with no parental history of diabetes. Blood pressure and fasting glucose did not differ according to parental history. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects of maternal antecedents with diabetes have known risk factors for NIDDM. This study does not identify whether there is a genetic or maternal environmental reason for this association.

TI	Diabetes and plasma lipoproteins in Native Americans. Studies of the Pima Indians.
PG	284-91
AB	OBJECTIVE--To determine the effects of diabetes on plasma lipoproteins in Pima Indians, to identify metabolic determinants of these differences, and to examine the effects of various modes of diabetes therapy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--A series of studies was performed including a population survey of lipoprotein concentrations, kinetic studies of VLDL and LDL metabolism, and studies of the effects of weight loss, sulfonylureas, and high carbohydrate diets. RESULTS--Population data established that diabetes was consistently associated with elevations in total and VLDL TGs and decreases in HDL cholesterol. Metabolic studies indicated multiple alterations in VLDL metabolism induced by NIDDM, including overproduction of VLDL TG, impaired clearance of VLDL TG and apoB, and decreases in adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase. Although changes in LDL concentrations accompanying NIDDM were minimal, the clearance of LDL appeared to be impaired and a higher proportion of VLDL was metabolized without conversion to LDL. There were significant changes in the flux of particles to the LDL compartment. Total and VLDL TG concentrations were found to be inversely related to rates of insulin-mediated glucose disposal, and HDL cholesterol concentrations were positively related to glucose disposal. These relationships between lipoproteins and insulin action were independent of adiposity and insulin, suggesting that insulin resistance may be involved with diabetes-induced changes in VLDL and HDL. Weight loss was associated with decreases in total and VLDL TG, decreases in total and LDL cholesterol, and improvements in the ratio of HDL to LDL cholesterol. Sulfonylurea therapy was associated with lower total and VLDL TGs and lower LDL cholesterol, but little change in HDL. Substitution of complex carbohydrates for saturated fat in the diet showed consistent and significant decreases in total and LDL cholesterol, no decreases in HDL cholesterol, or elevation of total or VLDL TG. CONCLUSIONS--Studies suggest that there are multiple changes in plasma lipoproteins accompanying NIDDM in Pima Indians, but that many of these may be reversed by current modes of hypoglycemic therapy.

TI	Diabetes and hypoglycaemia in young children and mutations in the Kir6.2 subunit of the potassium channel: therapeutic consequences.
PG	569-80
AB	ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K(ATP)) couple cell metabolism to electrical activity by regulating potassium movement across the membrane. These channels are octameric complex with two kind of subunits: four regulatory sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) embracing four poreforming inwardly rectifying potassium channel (Kir). Several isoforms exist for each type of subunits: SUR1 is found in the pancreatic beta-cell and neurons, whereas SUR2A is in heart cells and SUR2B in smooth muscle; Kir6.2 is in the majority of tissues as pancreatic beta-cells, brain, heart and skeletal muscle, and Kir6.1 can be found in smooth vascular muscle and astrocytes. The K(ATP) channels play multiple physiological roles in the glucose metabolism regulation, especially in beta-cells where it regulates insulin secretion, in response to an increase in ATP concentration. They also seem to be critical metabolic sensors in protection against metabolic stress as hypo or hyperglycemia, hypoxia, ischemia. Persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycaemia (HI) of infancy is a heterogeneous disorder which may be divided into two histopathological forms (diffuse and focal lesions). Different inactivating mutations have been implicated in both forms: the permanent inactivation of the K(ATP) channels provokes inappropriate insulin secretion, despite low ATP. Diazoxide, used efficiently in certain cases of HI, opens the K(ATP) channels and therefore overpass the mutation effect on the insulin secretion. Conversely, several studies reported sequencing of KCNJ11, coding for Kir6.2, in patients with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus and found different mutations in 30 to 50% of the cases. More than 28 heterozygous activating mutations have now been identified, the most frequent mutation being in the aminoacid R201. These mutations result in reduced ATP-sensitivity of the K(ATP) channels compared with the wild-types and the level of channel block is responsible for different clinical features: the &quot;mild&quot; form confers isolated permanent neonatal diabetes whereas the severe form combines diabetes and neurological symptoms such as epilepsy, deve-lopmental delay, muscle weakness and mild dimorphic features. Sulfonylureas close K(ATP) channels by binding with high affinity to SUR suggesting they could replace insulin in these patients. Subsequently, more than 50 patients have been reported as successfully and safely switched from subcutaneous insulin injections to oral sulfonylurea therapy, with an improvement in their glycated hemoglobin. We therefore designed a protocol to transfer and evaluate children who have insulin treated neonatal diabetes due to KCNJ11 mutation, from insulin to sulfonylurea. The transfer from insulin injections to oral glibenclamide therapy seems highly effective for most patients and safe. This shows how the molecular understan-ding of some monogenic form of diabetes may lead to an unexpected change of the treatment in children. This is a spectacular example by which a pharmacogenomic approach improves the quality of life of our young diabetic patients in a tremendous way.

TI	The association of variable number of tandem repeats of the insulin gene with susceptibility to type 1 diabetes among Korean subjects.
PG	474-80
AB	BACKGROUND: There is ethnic variation in the variable number of tandem repeats of the insulin gene (INS VNTR), one of the susceptibility loci for developing type 1 diabetes (T1D). We evaluated the influence of the genotypes and subdivisions of INS VNTR on the development of T1D in Korean subjects. METHODS: The study included 352 Korean patients, under the age of 18 years who were diagnosed as having T1D, and 356 control subjects. The insulin	23HphI A/T single nucleotide polymorphism was used as a marker of class I and III alleles. Surrounding polymorphisms at nucleotide positions + 1127, + 1140, + 2331 and + 2336 were determined as subdivisions of INS VNTR. RESULTS: Classes I/I, I/III and III/III were observed at frequencies of 95.8, 4.2 and 0% among all subjects, respectively. Class I/III genotype was significantly less frequent in patients with T1D than in controls (2.56 versus 5.90%; odds ratio 0.419; P = 0.039). In a subdivision analysis, the ID/ID genotype was decreased among patients (P = 0.017, adjusted P = 0.085) and the IC allele tended to increase. The frequency of the class I/III genotype was significantly lower among patients who were diagnosed when younger than 7 years of age than in controls (odds ratio 0.115; P = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: INS VNTR has predominance of class I over class III alleles and is associated with susceptibility to T1D in Koreans. In addition, INS VNTR shows distinctive susceptibility according to the age at the onset of T1D.

TI	Insulin VNTR I/III genotype is associated with autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase in newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes.
PG	567-71
AB	BACKGROUND: In type 1 diabetes (T1D), the influence of age at diagnosis and of the IDDM1 and IDDM2 genetic susceptibility loci on the profile of beta-cell autoantibodies has been demonstrated. We studied these associations in a group of 92 patients (children, adolescents and adults, aged 2-62 years) with newly diagnosed T1D. METHODS: The prevalence of the HLA-DQB1*02 and *0302 alleles and of the classes of variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) of the insulin gene (INS), and of beta-cell autoantibodies (GADA, IA-2A, ICA and IAA) was determined. Statistical analysis was performed using linear and logistic regression models. RESULTS: The presence of IAA, IA-2A and ICA, but not of GADA, was negatively associated with age at diagnosis. Younger patients were more likely to have multiple autoantibodies. There was a tendency of a higher prevalence of IAA in patients with the HLA-DQB1*02/0302 genotype or with the DQB1*0302 allele compared to patients lacking these markers. As a novel observation, the INS VNTR I/III genotype was significantly associated with the presence of GADA (OR = 4.79; p = 0.018). CONCLUSION: The association between the INS VNTR I/III genotype and GADA may suggest that in patients with T1D lacking the INS VNTR I/I genotype, the effect of other susceptibility factors prevails, which promotes the development of autoimmunity to beta-cell antigens other than insulin.

TI	Mutations in the ABCC8 gene encoding the SUR1 subunit of the KATP channel cause transient neonatal diabetes, permanent neonatal diabetes or permanent diabetes diagnosed outside the neonatal period.
PG	28-39
AB	AIM: Mutations in the ABCC8 gene encoding the SUR1 subunit of the pancreatic ATP-sensitive potassium channel cause permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM) and transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM). We reviewed the existing literature, extended the number of cases and explored genotype-phenotype correlations. METHODS: Mutations were identified by sequencing in patients diagnosed with diabetes before 6 months without a KCNJ11 mutation. RESULTS: We identified ABCC8 mutations in an additional nine probands (including five novel mutations L135P, R306H, R1314H, L438F and M1290V), bringing the total of reported families to 48. Both dominant and recessive mutations were observed with recessive inheritance more common in PNDM than TNDM (9 vs. 1; p &lt; 0.01). The remainder of the PNDM probands (n = 12) had de novo mutations. Seventeen of twenty-five children with TNDM inherited their heterozygous mutation from a parent. Nine of these parents had permanent diabetes (median age at diagnosis: 27.5 years, range: 13-35 years). Recurrent mutations of residues R1183 and R1380 were found only in TNDM probands and dominant mutations causing PNDM clustered within exons 2-5. CONCLUSIONS: ABCC8 mutations cause PNDM, TNDM or permanent diabetes diagnosed outside the neonatal period. There is some evidence that the location of the mutation is correlated with the clinical phenotype.

METHODS: The DNA was extracted and SNP in the human TNF-alpha and TNF-beta genes at positions -308 (G/A) and 252 (A/G), respectively, was analyzed using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Plasma levels of TNF-alpha in different stages of pregnancy were quantified using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: There was no significant difference in genotype and allele frequency of SNP at position -308 (G/A) in the promoter region of the human TNF-alpha gene as well as the SNP at position 252 (A/G) in the human TNF-beta gene between the GDM and control subjects. Using the logistic regression model, it was found that the SNP in the TNF-alpha as well as TNF-beta were not associated with development of GDM. In addition, the TNF-alpha levels in the plasma of GDM and control mothers were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: In the population studied, the SNP in position -308 (G/A) of the human TNF-alpha or in position 252 (A/G) of the human TNF-beta gene is not an independent risk factor or a predictor for GDM.

PG	332-4
AB	A girl with celiac disease and KCNJ11 mutation was transferred to glibenclamide when 19.8 years old. When her compliance to the gluten free diet worsened, her metabolic control deteriorated. Since glibenclamide is absorbed in the intestine, its absorption seems to be impaired by chronic malabsorption, increasing the risk of hyperglycaemia.

TI	Excess maternal transmission and familial aggregation of Type 2 diabetes in Sri Lanka.
PG	173-7
AB	INTRODUCTION: An excess of maternal transmission of Type 2 diabetes mellitus has been reported in Europid populations, but not in South India. METHOD: A questionnaire-based survey was carried out in 1000 (502 male) people with Type 2 diabetes to establish whether there is an excess of maternal transmission and familial aggregation in a Sri Lankan population. RESULTS: Mean age of onset was 47+/-12 (+/-S.D.) years and duration of diabetes was 9+/-7 years. Thirty-seven percent reported parents with diabetes, 46.9% had no parents with diabetes, 16.1% did not know the diabetes status of at least one parent and there was no diabetes in the other. Of the probands, 59.4% had at least one affected relative. When both parents' diabetes status was known and only one was affected, diabetes was more common among mothers (n = 156) than fathers (n = 125) of probands (P &lt; 0.001). A further 54 probands had both parents with diabetes. Mean age of onset and duration of the disease among probands with parental diabetes was 43.1+/-(11.1) and 9.6+/-(6.8). In the previous generation, 21.2% of maternal grandmothers and 17.3% of maternal grandfathers in the maternal diabetes group and 4.8% of maternal grandmothers and 17% of maternal grandfathers in the paternal diabetes group had diabetes. Diabetes in siblings and children was more common in those with mothers who had diabetes (53.8% and 4.5%) when compared with those in whom fathers had diabetes (42.4% and 1.6%) (P &lt; 0.0001 and P &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSION: Familial aggregation and excess maternal transmission were observed in people with Type 2 diabetes in Sri Lanka.

TI	Evidence that the mitochondrial genome is the thrifty genome.
PG	127-35
AB	Although mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) abnormalities are known to cause insulin deficiency, insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus, it's quantitative aspect was not addressed well. In this review, mitochondrial genome hypothesis of thrifty phenomenon is proposed, based on the data and review of literatures. From a population based epidemiologic study, it was found that mtDNA quantity was decreased in the peripheral blood of diabetic subjects, and also in those subjects who will convert to diabetes mellitus within 2 years. In this population, low mtDNA subjects were found to have higher blood pressure and high waist hip ratio. These findings suggested mtDNA status might be quantitatively linked to the insulin resistance syndrome. As quantitative relationships between peripheral blood mtDNA levels and insulin requirement, and energy utilization pattern (fat and carbohydrate oxidation during hyperinsulinemic clamp studies) were observed in a group of male students; and maternal mtDNA content (peripheral blood) correlated with birth weight and peripheral blood mtDNA content of the offspring in another study, possibility of thrifty phenotype phenomena might be due to the low mitochondrial status arose. As thrifty phenotype phenomenon shows the quantitatively continuous relationship between involved parameters and characteristics of 'imprinting', a possible mechanism is suggested.

TI	Relationship between ADIPOQ gene, circulating high molecular weight adiponectin and albuminuria in individuals with normal kidney function: evidence from a family-based study.
PG	812-8
AB	AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Insulin resistance is associated with reduced serum adiponectin and increased albuminuria levels. Thus, one would anticipate an inverse relationship between circulating adiponectin and albuminuria. However, several studies have described a 'paradoxical' elevation of serum adiponectin in patients with elevated albuminuria. These findings may have been confounded by the presence of diseases and related treatments known to affect circulating adiponectin and albuminuria. We therefore studied the relationship between circulating adiponectin and albuminuria in the absence of such confounders. METHODS: To this purpose, the relationship between adiponectin isoforms and albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) was investigated in a family-based sample of 634 non-diabetic untreated white individuals with normal kidney function. We also investigated whether the two variables share a common genetic background and addressed the specific role of the gene encoding adiponectin on that background by genotyping several ADIPOQ single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). RESULTS: ACR was directly associated with high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin isoform (p = 0.024). The two variables shared some genetic correlation (rho(g) = 0.38, p = 0.04). ADIPOQ promoter SNP rs17300539 was associated with HMW adiponectin (p = 4.8 x 10(-5)) and ACR (p =0.0027). The genetic correlation between HMW adiponectin and ACR was no longer significant when SNP rs17300539 was added to the model, thus reinforcing the role of this SNP in determining both traits. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our study shows a positive, independent correlation between HWM adiponectin and ACR. ADIPOQ variability is associated with HMW adiponectin and ACR, and explains some of the common genetic background shared by these traits, thus suggesting that ADIPOQ and HMW adiponectin modulate albuminuria levels.

TI	Further refinement of the critical minimal genetic region for the imprinting disorder 6q24 transient neonatal diabetes.
PG	2347-51
AB	AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Transient neonatal diabetes (TND) is associated with overexpression of genes within a critical region on 6q24. This study aims to refine the boundaries of this region to reduce the number of potential candidate genes for 6q24 TND. METHODS: Fifteen patients with transient neonatal diabetes and submicroscopic chromosome 6 duplications were investigated. The duplications were confirmed by microsatellite analysis and subsequently mapped using tiled chromosome 6 array Comparative Genomic Hybridisation (aCGH) and MLPA. Duplication boundaries were compared to identify the minimal shared region of duplication. These data were then used with available clinical data to identify associations between size of 6q24 duplication and severity of TND phenotype. RESULTS: Alignment of the minimal region of duplication to the human genome reduced the minimal TND critical region, formerly estimated at 440 kb, to 160-173 kb, revealing PLAGL1 (pleiomorphic adenoma gene-like 1) and HYMAI (imprinted in hydatidiform mole) to be the only genes wholly included therein. Additionally, the complete paternal duplication of a region containing the theoretical protein FAM164B was associated with the severe growth restriction observed in 6q24 duplication patients. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This study has significantly reduced the critical region associated with 6q24 TND. It has eliminated several previous TND candidate genes, leaving the overlapping imprinted genes PLAGL1 and HYMAI as the only remaining complete candidate genes for 6q24 TND. Moreover, these data provide the first evidence that an additional region, encompassing the theoretical protein FAM164B, may have a critical role in the growth restriction phenotype observed in many 6q24 TND patients.

TI	A susceptibility gene for type 2 diabetes confers substantial risk for diabetes complicating cystic fibrosis.
PG	1858-65
AB	AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Insulin-requiring diabetes affects 25-50% of young adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). Although the cause of diabetes in CF is unknown, recent heritability studies in CF twins and siblings indicate that genetic modifiers play a substantial role. We sought to assess whether genes conferring risk for diabetes in the general population may play a risk modifying role in CF. METHODS: We tested whether a family history of type 2 diabetes affected diabetes risk in CF patients in 539 families in the CF Twin and Sibling family-based study. A type 2 diabetes susceptibility gene (transcription factor 7-like 2, or TCF7L2) was evaluated for association with diabetes in CF using 998 patients from the family-based study and 802 unrelated CF patients in an independent case-control study. RESULTS: Family history of type 2 diabetes increased the risk of diabetes in CF (OR 3.1; p = 0.0009). A variant in TCF7L2 associated with type 2 diabetes (the T allele at rs7903146) was associated with diabetes in CF in the family study (p = 0.004) and in the case-control study (p = 0.02; combined p = 0.0002). In the family-based study, variation in TCF7L2 increased the risk of diabetes about three-fold (HR 1.75 per allele, 95% CI 1.3-2.4; p = 0.0006), and decreased the mean age at diabetes diagnosis by 7 years. In CF patients not treated with systemic glucocorticoids, the effect of TCF7L2 was even greater (HR 2.9 per allele, 95% CI 1.7-4.9, p = 0.00011). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: A genetic variant conferring risk for type 2 diabetes in the general population is a modifier of risk for diabetes in CF.

TI	Interaction between prenatal growth and high-risk genotypes in the development of type 2 diabetes.
PG	825-9
AB	AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Early environmental factors and genetic variants have been reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is an interaction between birthweight and common variants in the TCF7L2, HHEX, PPARG, KCNJ11, SLC30A8, IGF2BP2, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/2B and JAZF1 genes in the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A total of 2,003 participants from the Helsinki Birth Cohort Study, 311 of whom were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes by an OGTT, were genotyped for the specified variants. Indices for insulin sensitivity and secretion were calculated. RESULTS: Low birthweight was associated with type 2 diabetes (p = 0.008) and impaired insulin secretion (p = 0.04). Of the tested variants, the risk variant in HHEX showed a trend towards a low birthweight (p = 0.09) and the risk variant in the CDKN2A/2B locus was associated with high birthweight (p = 0.01). The TCF7L2 risk allele was associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Pooling across all nine genes, each risk allele increased the risk of type 2 diabetes by 14%. [corrected] Risk variants in the HHEX, CDKN2A/2B and JAZF1 genes interacted with birthweight, so that the risk of type 2 diabetes was highest in those with lower birthweight (p &lt;or= 0.05). The interaction was also present in the pooled data. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Low birthweight might affect the strength of the association of some common variants (HHEX, CDKN2A/2B and JAZF1) with type 2 diabetes. These findings need to be replicated in independent cohorts.

TI	Association analysis of the IGF1 gene with childhood growth, IGF-1 concentrations and type 1 diabetes.
PG	811-5
AB	AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Insulin-like growth factor-1 is a major childhood growth factor and promotes pancreatic islet cell survival and growth in vitro. We hypothesised that genetic variation in IGF1 might be associated with childhood growth, glucose metabolism and type 1 diabetes risk. We therefore examined the association between common genetic variation in IGF1 and predisposition to type 1 diabetes, childhood growth and metabolism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Variants in IGF1 were identified by direct resequencing of the exons, exon-intron boundaries and 5' and 3' regions in 32 unrelated type 1 diabetes patients. A tagging subset of these variants was genotyped in a collection of type 1 diabetes families (3,121 parent-child trios). We also genotyped a previously reported CA repeat in the region 5' to IGF1. A subset of seven tag single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) that captured variants with minor allele frequency (MAF) &gt; or =0.05 was genotyped in 902 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents And Children with data on growth, IGF-1 concentrations, insulin secretion and insulin action. RESULTS: Resequencing detected 27 SNPs in IGF1, of which 11 had a MAF &gt; 0.05 and were novel. Variants with MAF &gt; or = 0.10 were captured by a set of four tag-SNPs. These SNPs showed no association with type 1 diabetes. In children, global variation in IGF1 was weakly associated with IGF-1 concentrations, but not with other phenotypes. The CA repeat in the region 5' to IGF1 showed no association with any phenotype. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Common genetic variation in IGF1 alters IGF-1 concentrations but is not associated with growth, glucose metabolism or type 1 diabetes.

TI	Best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of maturity-onset diabetes of the young.
PG	546-53
AB	AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Mutations in the GCK and HNF1A genes are the most common cause of the monogenic forms of diabetes known as 'maturity-onset diabetes of the young'. GCK encodes the glucokinase enzyme, which acts as the pancreatic glucose sensor, and mutations result in stable, mild fasting hyperglycaemia. A progressive insulin secretory defect is seen in patients with mutations in the HNF1A and HNF4A genes encoding the transcription factors hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha and -4 alpha. A molecular genetic diagnosis often changes management, since patients with GCK mutations rarely require pharmacological treatment and HNF1A/4A mutation carriers are sensitive to sulfonylureas. These monogenic forms of diabetes are often misdiagnosed as type 1 or 2 diabetes. Best practice guidelines for genetic testing were developed to guide testing and reporting of results. METHODS: A workshop was held to discuss clinical criteria for testing and the interpretation of molecular genetic test results. The participants included 22 clinicians and scientists from 13 countries. Draft best practice guidelines were formulated and edited using an online tool (http://www.coventi.com). RESULTS: An agreed set of clinical criteria were defined for the testing of babies, children and adults for GCK, HNF1A and HNF4A mutations. Reporting scenarios were discussed and consensus statements produced. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Best practice guidelines have been established for monogenic forms of diabetes caused by mutations in the GCK, HNF1A and HNF4A genes. The guidelines include both diagnostic and predictive genetic tests and interpretation of the results.

TI	Partial and whole gene deletion mutations of the GCK and HNF1A genes in maturity-onset diabetes of the young.
PG	2313-7
AB	AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Heterozygous mutations of glucokinase (GCK) and hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha (HNF1A; also known as hepatic transcription factor 1 [TCF1]) genes are the most common cause of MODY. Genomic deletions of the HNF1B (also known as TCF2) gene have recently been shown to account for one third of mutations causing renal cysts and diabetes syndrome. We investigated the prevalence of partial and whole gene deletions in UK patients meeting clinical criteria for GCK or HNF-1alpha/-4alpha MODY and in whom no mutation had been identified by sequence analysis. METHODS: A multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay was developed using synthetic oligonucleotide probes for 30 exons of the GCK, HNF1A and HNF4A genes. RESULTS: Partial or whole gene deletions were identified in 1/29 (3.5%) probands using the GCK MLPA assay and 4/60 (6.7%) of probands using the HNF1A/-4A MLPA assay. Four different deletions were detected: GCK exon 2, HNF1A exon 1, HNF1A exons 2 to 10 and HNF1A exons 1 to 10. An additional Danish pedigree with evidence of linkage to HNF1A had a deletion of exons 2 to 10. Testing other family members confirmed co-segregation of the deletion mutations with diabetes in the pedigrees. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Large deletions encompassing whole exons can cause GCK or HNF-1alpha MODY and will not be detected by sequencing. Gene dosage assays, such as MLPA, are a useful adjunct to sequence analysis when a diagnosis of MODY is strongly suspected.

TI	Relationships of maternal and paternal birthweights to features of the metabolic syndrome in adult offspring: an inter-generational study in South India.
PG	43-54
AB	AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The association between lower birthweight and metabolic syndrome may result from fetal undernutrition (fetal programming hypothesis) and/or genes causing both low birthweight and insulin resistance (fetal insulin hypothesis). We studied associations between the birthweight of parents and metabolic syndrome in the offspring. METHODS: We identified men and women (aged 35-68 years), who had been born in Holdsworth Memorial Hospital, Mysore, India. We also identified the offspring (20-46 years) of these men and women. In total, 283 offspring of 193 mothers and 223 offspring of 144 fathers were studied. Investigations included anthropometry, oral glucose tolerance, plasma insulin and lipid concentrations and blood pressure. The metabolic syndrome was defined using WHO criteria. RESULTS: Among the offspring, lower birthweight was associated with an increased risk of glucose intolerance (impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose or type 2 diabetes) and higher cholesterol and triacylglycerol concentrations (p &lt; 0.05 for all adjusted for sex and age). Most outcomes in the offspring, including most individual components of the metabolic syndrome, were unrelated to parental birthweight. However, both maternal and paternal birthweight were inversely related to offspring metabolic syndrome (odds ratio [OR] 0.36 [95% CI: 0.13-1.01] per kg, p = 0.053 for mother-offspring pairs; OR 0.26 [0.07-0.93], p = 0.04 for father-offspring pairs, adjusted for offspring age, sex, BMI and socioeconomic status). Maternal birthweight was inversely related to offspring systolic blood pressure (beta = -2.5 mmHg [-5.00 to 0.03] per kg maternal birthweight; p = 0.052). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Factors in both parents may influence the risk of metabolic syndrome in their offspring. There are several possible explanations, but the findings are consistent with the fetal insulin (genetic) hypothesis.

TI	Transcription factor 7-like 2 polymorphisms and type 2 diabetes, glucose homeostasis traits and gene expression in US participants of European and African descent.
PG	1621-30
AB	AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We sought to determine: (1) the role of previously described transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) variants in type 2 diabetes in African American individuals and in participants of European ancestry; (2) the physiological impact of these variants on glucose homeostasis; and (3) whether the non-coding variants altered TCF7L2 expression in adipocytes and transformed lymphocytes. METHODS: Association studies were conducted by genotyping 932 Europid and African American diabetic and control participants. Family studies were conducted in 673 members of 68 Europid families ascertained for at least two diabetic siblings. Metabolic studies were conducted in 585 non-diabetic individuals who had undergone frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance tests to determine insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion. Gene expression studies were conducted in 74 adipose samples and 64 muscle samples from non-diabetic individuals with known genotypes and also in 55 lymphoblastoid cell lines. RESULTS: TCF7L2 variants were associated with type 2 diabetes in a Europid case-control population and in families, but not in African Americans. Risk alleles increased the 60 min post-challenge glucose value in Europid families and reduced insulin sensitivity by 45% in Europids, but did not alter insulin secretion. TCF7L2 expression was not altered by genotype and did not correlate with insulin sensitivity or BMI. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We confirmed TCF7L2 as a risk factor in a population of European descent, where it reduced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, but not insulin secretion. We found no role in African Americans and could not explain the association by altered adipocyte or muscle gene expression.

TI	Fetal growth is increased by maternal type 1 diabetes and HLA DR4-related gene interactions.
PG	850-8
AB	AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Intrauterine growth in non-diabetic pregnancies is reported to be influenced by type 1 diabetes susceptibility genes. In particular, the high-risk HLA DR4_DQB1*0302 haplotype is associated with increased birthweight. The aim of this study was to determine whether HLA DR4 was associated with increased birthweight in a maternal diabetes environment and whether effects persisted during early childhood. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Birthweight and gestational age were obtained in singleton births from mothers with type 1 diabetes (n = 1161) or whose fathers or siblings have type 1 diabetes (n = 872). Weight and height at ages 2 and 5 years were obtained from paediatric records. Data were adjusted for (gestational) age and sex and expressed as percentiles of German reference data. HLA DR typing was obtained for all children and 1090 children also had insulin gene (INS) variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) typing. RESULTS: Maternal type 1 diabetes was associated with increased birthweight, gestational age and birthweight percentiles (all p &lt; 0.0001). In children of mothers with type 1 diabetes, birthweight percentile was further related to maternal HbA(1c) during pregnancy (r = 0.26; p &lt; 0.0001) and was independently increased if children had HLA DR4 alleles (76th vs 64th percentile; p &lt; 0.0001). HLA DR4 was not associated with birthweight in children of non-diabetic mothers. Birthweight was not associated with INS VNTR genotypes. High birthweight, but not HLA DR4 was associated with increased weight and BMI at ages 2 and 5 years (p &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that a diabetic intrauterine environment interacts with gene(s) marked by the type 1 diabetes susceptibility HLA DR4 alleles to increase fetal growth.

TI	The relation between size at birth and risk of type 1 diabetes is not influenced by adjustment for the insulin gene (-23HphI) polymorphism or HLA-DQ genotype.
PG	2068-73
AB	AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Associations have been described between higher birthweight and increased risk of type 1 diabetes, and of insulin (INS) and human leucocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes that protect against diabetes with larger size at birth. We studied simultaneously the effects of size at birth, INS and HLA genotypes on the risk of type 1 diabetes to test whether the relation between size at birth and risk of type 1 diabetes would be strengthened after adjustment for INS and HLA genotypes. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We designed a population-based case-control study in Norway with 471 cases of childhood-onset type 1 diabetes and 1,369 control subjects who were genotyped for the INS -23HphI polymorphism (surrogate for INS variable number of tandem repeats) and HLA-DQ alleles associated with type 1 diabetes. Data on birthweight and other perinatal factors were obtained from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway by record linkage. RESULTS: The data fitted a multiplicative model for the protective INS class III allele both within the INS locus and for the model with INS	and HLA-DQ-conferred risk of type 1 diabetes. We found no overall significant association between weight or head circumference at birth and the risk of type 1 diabetes, and adjustment for INS and HLA genotype did not influence this result. There was also no evidence for association of INS or HLA with size at birth among control subjects. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In contrast to suggestions from previous indirect studies, direct adjustment for INS and HLA genotypes did not lead to a stronger relation between birthweight and the risk of type 1 diabetes.

TI	Improved motor development and good long-term glycaemic control with sulfonylurea treatment in a patient with the syndrome of intermediate developmental delay, early-onset generalised epilepsy and neonatal diabetes associated with the V59M mutation in the KCNJ11 gene.
PG	2559-63
AB	AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Activating mutations in the KCNJ11 gene encoding the Kir6.2 subunit of the K(ATP) channels in pancreatic beta cells are a common cause of neonatal diabetes. One-third of patients also have developmental delay, which probably results from mutated K(ATP) channels in muscle, nerve and brain. Sulfonylureas, which bind to the sulfonylurea receptor 1 subunit of the K(ATP) channel, can replace insulin injections in patients with KCNJ11 mutations. The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term outcome and impact on neurological features of sulfonylurea treatment. METHODS: We report the response to sulfonylurea treatment in a boy with neonatal diabetes and marked developmental delay resulting from the KCNJ11 mutation V59M. RESULTS: Glibenclamide (glyburide) treatment was started at 23 months and resulted in insulin being discontinued, lower overall glycaemia, reduced glucose fluctuations and reduced hypoglycaemia. Good control (HbA(1c) 6.5%) was maintained 2 years after discontinuing insulin, despite a reduction in the glibenclamide dose (from 0.41 to 0.11 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)). Within 1 month of starting glibenclamide there was marked improvement in motor function, resulting in the patient progressing from being unable to stand unaided to walking independently, but there was no improvement in mental function. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This 2-year follow-up of a patient highlights that sulfonylurea treatment can result in prolonged, excellent glycaemic control and may improve motor features, but not mental features, associated with KCNJ11 mutations. This suggests that the neurological actions of sulfonylurea are initially principally on peripheral (nerve or muscle) rather than on central (brain) K(ATP) channels. Early molecular diagnosis is important in patients with neonatal diabetes and neurological features.

TI	Lymphoid tyrosine phosphatase (LYP/PTPN22) Arg620Trp variant regulates insulin autoimmunity and progression to type 1 diabetes.
PG	1198-208
AB	AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We analysed the contribution of the lymphoid protein tyrosine phosphatase (LYP) Arg620Trp variant (which corresponds to the PTPN22 C1858T polymorphism) to the emergence of beta-cell-specific humoral autoimmunity and progression to type 1 diabetes in man. We also explored the heterogeneity in the disease-predisposing effect of this polymorphism in relation to known disease loci, sex and age at disease onset. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A population-derived Finnish birth cohort with increased disease susceptibility conferred by HLA-DQB1 was monitored for the appearance of islet cell autoantibodies, and individuals found to be positive were tested for autoantibodies against insulin (IAA), glutamic acid decarboxylase and islet antigen-2 (n = 574; mean follow-up time 4.9 years). Gene interaction effects on disease susceptibility were analysed in case-control and family series (546 patients, 538 controls, 245 nuclear families). All subjects were typed for HLA DR-DQ, insulin gene (INS), CTLA4 and PTPN22 C1858T polymorphisms. RESULTS: The PTPN22 1858TT genotype was associated with the appearance of IAA (adjusted hazard ratio = 4.6, 95% CI 2.4-9.0; p = 0.000013). PTPN22, INS and HLA-DRB1 had an additive effect on the emergence of IAA. The 1858TT and CT genotypes conferred an increased risk of developing additional autoantibodies or clinical disease (hazard ratio=4.1, 95% CI 1.5-11.6; and 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.4, respectively; p = 0.003). The strong effect of PTPN22 on disease susceptibility (p = 2.1 x 10(-8)) was more pronounced in males (p = 0.021) and in subjects with non-DR4-DQ8/low-risk HLA genotypes (p = 0.0004). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes the underlying mechanism of the PTPN22 C1858T polymorphism appears to involve regulation of insulin-specific autoimmunity. Importantly, it strongly affects progression from prediabetes to clinical disease.

TI	Mutations in KCNJ11, which encodes Kir6.2, are a common cause of diabetes diagnosed in the first 6 months of life, with the phenotype determined by genotype.
PG	1190-7
AB	AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Heterozygous activating mutations in KCNJ11, which encodes the Kir6.2 subunit of the pancreatic ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel, cause both permanent and transient neonatal diabetes. A minority of patients also have neurological features. The identification of a KCNJ11 mutation has important therapeutic implications, as many patients can replace insulin injections with sulfonylurea tablets. We aimed to determine the age of presentation of patients with KCNJ11 mutations and to examine if there was a relationship between genotype and phenotype. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: KCNJ11 was sequenced in 239 unrelated patients from 21 countries, who were diagnosed with permanent diabetes before 2 years of age. RESULTS: Thirty-one of the 120 patients (26%) diagnosed in the first 26 weeks of life had a KCNJ11 mutation; no mutations were found in the 119 cases (0%) diagnosed after this age. Fourteen different heterozygous mutations were identified, with the majority resulting from de novo mutations. These include seven novel mutations: H46Y, R50Q, G53D C166Y, K170T, L164P and Y330S. All 11 probands with the most common mutation, R201H, had isolated diabetes. In contrast, developmental delay in addition to diabetes was seen in four of five probands with the V59M mutation and two of four with the R201C mutation. Five patients with developmental delay, epilepsy and neonatal diabetes (DEND) syndrome had unique mutations not associated with other phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: KCNJ11 mutations are a common cause of permanent diabetes diagnosed in the first 6 months and all patients diagnosed in this age group should be tested. There is a strong genotype-phenotype relationship with the mutation being an important determinant of associated neurological features.

TI	Common polymorphisms of calpain-10 are associated with abdominal obesity in subjects at high risk of type 2 diabetes.
PG	1560-6
AB	AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The mechanisms by which the calpain-10 gene (CAPN10) affects the risk of type 2 diabetes are unclear. Therefore, we investigated the effects of four polymorphisms in CAPN10 (single nucleotide polymorphism [SNP]-43, SNP-44, Insertion/Deletion [Indel]-19 and SNP-63) on insulin secretion, insulin action and abdominal fat distribution in offspring of patients with type 2 diabetes. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Insulin secretion was determined by an IVGTT, insulin action by the hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp and abdominal fat distribution by computed tomography in 158 non-diabetic offspring (age 34.9+/-6.3 years [mean+/-SD], BMI 26.2+/-4.9 kg/m(2)) of type 2 diabetic patients. RESULTS: SNP-43 (p=0.009 over the three genotypes, adjusted for age, sex, BMI and family relationship) and haplotypes carrying the A allele of SNP-43 were associated with intra-abdominal fat area. The A allele of SNP-43 was associated with intra-abdominal fat area in men (p=0.014) but not in women. SNP-44, InDel-19 and SNP-63 were not associated with intra-abdominal fat area or insulin action. Furthermore, we demonstrated in a separate sample of middle-aged men (n=234) who had a history of type 2 diabetes in first-degree relatives that the A allele of SNP-43 was associated with a large waist circumference, and high insulin levels in an OGTT. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: SNP-43 of CAPN10 may contribute to the risk of diabetes by regulating abdominal obesity in subjects with high risk of type 2 diabetes.

TI	Impact of IDDM2 on disease pathogenesis and progression in children with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes: reduced insulin antibody titres and preserved beta cell function.
PG	71-4
AB	AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 2 gene (IDDM2) is a type 1 diabetes susceptibility locus contributed to by the variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) upstream of the insulin gene (INS). We investigated the association between INS VNTR class III alleles (-23HphIA/T) and both insulin antibody presentation and residual beta cell function during the first year after diagnosis in 257 children with type 1 diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To estimate C-peptide levels and autoantibody presentation, patients underwent a meal-stimulated C-peptide test 1, 6, and 12 months after diagnosis. The insulin -23HphIA/T variant was used as a marker of class III alleles and genotyped by PCR-RFLP. RESULTS: The insulin antibody titres at 1 and 6 months were significantly lower in the class III/III and class I/III genotype groups than in the class I/I genotype group (p = 0.01). Class III alleles were also associated with residual beta cell function 12 months after diagnosis and independently of age, sex, BMI, insulin antibody titres, and HLA-risk genotype group (p = 0.03). The C-peptide level was twice as high among class III/III genotypes as in class I/I and class I/III genotypes (319 vs 131 and 166 pmol/l, p=0.01). Furthermore, the class III/III genotype had a 1.1% reduction in HbA(1)c after adjustment for insulin dose (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These findings suggest a direct connection in vivo between INS VNTR class III alleles, a decreased humoral immune response to insulin, and preservation of beta cell function in recent-onset type 1 diabetes.

TI	Molecular genetics and phenotypic characteristics of MODY caused by hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha mutations in a large European collection.
PG	878-85
AB	AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Heterozygous mutations in the gene of the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF-4alpha) are considered a rare cause of MODY with only 14 mutations reported to date. The description of the phenotype is limited to single families. We investigated the genetics and phenotype of HNF-4alpha mutations in a large European Caucasian collection. METHODS: HNF-4alpha was sequenced in 48 MODY probands, selected for a phenotype of HNF-1alpha MODY but negative for HNF-1alpha mutations. Clinical characteristics and biochemistry were compared between 54 HNF-4alpha mutation carriers and 32 familial controls from ten newly detected or previously described families. RESULTS: Mutations in HNF-4alpha were found in 14/48 (29%) probands negative for HNF-1alpha mutations. The mutations found included seven novel mutations: S34X, D206Y, E276D, L332P, I314F, L332insCTG and IVS5nt+1G&gt;A. I314F is the first reported de novo HNF-4alpha mutation. The average age of diagnosis was 22.9 years with frequent clinical evidence of sensitivity to sulphonylureas. Beta cell function, but not insulin sensitivity, was reduced in diabetic mutation carriers compared to control subjects (homeostasis model assessment of beta cell function 29% p&lt;0.001 vs controls). HNF-4alpha mutations were associated with lower apolipoprotein A2 (p=0.001), A1 (p=0.04) and total HDL-cholesterol (p=0.02) than in control subjects. However, in contrast to some previous reports, levels of triglycerides and apolipoprotein C3 were normal. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: HNF-4alpha mutations are common when no HNF-1alpha mutation is found in strictly defined MODY families. The HNF-4alpha clinical phenotype and beta cell dysfunction are similar to HNF-1alpha MODY and are associated with reduced apolipoprotein A2 levels. We suggest that sequencing of HNF-4alpha should be performed in patients with clinical characteristics of HNF-1alpha MODY in whom mutations in HNF-1alpha are not found.

TI	Association of the Pro12Ala and C1431T variants of PPARG and their haplotypes with susceptibility to Type 2 diabetes.
PG	555-8
AB	AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The Pro12Ala polymorphism of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma has been consistently associated with Type 2 diabetes. The rare Ala12 variant is estimated to reduce the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes by 20 percent. This variant is in linkage disequilibrium with another common variant, T1431. Both have opposing associations with body weight. We therefore examined the association of specific haplotypes marked by these two variants with susceptibility to Type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We determined the PPARG genotype of a large Scottish cohort of Type 2 diabetic patients ( n=1997) and compared allele frequencies with a cohort of local children ( n=2444) and a middle-aged, population-based cohort from Scotland ( n=1061). RESULTS: Frequency of the Ala12 allele was slightly lower in the Type 2 diabetic cohort than in the children [odds ratio (OR)=0.91, p=0.1]. In contrast, the Ala12 variant was under-represented in the Type 2 diabetic population when compared with similarly aged non-diabetic adults (OR=0.74, p=0.0006). When the Ala12 variant was on a haplotype not bearing the 1431T variant, it conferred greater protection (OR=0.66, p=0.003). However, when it was present in haplotypes containing the 1431T variant (70% of Ala12 carriers), this protection was absent (OR=0.99, p=0.94). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We replicated the finding that the Ala12 variant of PPARgamma affords protection from Type 2 diabetes, and suggest that this protection is modulated by additional common variation at the PPARG locus.

TI	IDDM2/insulin VNTR modifies risk conferred by IDDM1/HLA for development of Type 1 diabetes and associated autoimmunity.
PG	712-20
AB	AIM/HYPOTHESIS: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease with multiple susceptibility genes. The aim of this study was to determine whether combining IDDM1/HLA and IDDM2/ insulin( INS) 5' variable number of tandem repeat locus (VNTR) genotypes improves T1D risk assessment. METHODS: Patients with T1D (n=488), control subjects (n=846), and offspring of parents with T1D (n=1122) were IDDM1 and IDDM2 genotyped. Offspring were followed for islet autoantibodies and T1D from birth until the age of 2 to 12 years. RESULTS: Compared to the I/I INS VNTR genotype, the I/III and III/III genotypes reduced T1D risk conferred by IDDM1/HLA in all HLA genotype categories of the case-control cohort by 1.6-fold to three-fold. The highest T1D risk was associated with INS VNTR class I/I plus HLA DR3/DR4-DQ8 (20.4% in patients, 0.6% in control subjects) or HLA DR4-DQ8/DR4-DQ8 (6.3% in patients, 0.2% in control subjects). In the offspring, HLA DR3/DR4-DQ8 and DR4-DQ8/DR4-DQ8 conferred increased risk for early development of islet autoantibodies (14.6% and 12.9% by age 2 years). Offspring with these high risk IDDM1 genotypes plus the INS VNTR class I/I genotype (n=71; 6.3%) had the highest risk of developing islet autoantibodies (21.8% by age 2 years vs 8.9% in offspring with high risk IDDM1 plus INS VNTR class I/III or III/III genotypes, p&lt;0.05) and T1D (8.5% by age 6 years vs 4.3%). Offspring who developed autoantibodies to multiple antigens had increased frequencies of both high risk IDDM1 and IDDM2 genotypes (p&lt;0.0001), whereas offspring who developed autoantibodies to GAD only had increased frequencies of high risk IDDM1 and protective IDDM2 genotypes, suggesting that IDDM2 influences the autoimmune target specificity. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Combining IDDM1 and IDDM2 genotyping identifies a minority of children with an increased T1D risk.

TI	Non-transmitted maternal HLA DQ2 or DQ8 alleles and risk of Type I diabetes in offspring: the importance of foetal or post partum exposure to diabetogenic molecules.
PG	1340-3
AB	AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus results from an immune-mediated destruction of pancreatic beta cells for which HLA haplotypes DR3-DQ2 and DR4-DQ8 represent the strongest genetic risk markers. Mothers of patients with rheumatoid arthritis carry more frequently the HLA DR4-DQ8 haplotype as non-transmitted haplotype than mothers of healthy control subjects. As maternal cells have been shown to persist in their offspring up to 30 years after birth, we investigated whether the association of HLA DR3-DQ2 and DR4-DQ8 with Type I diabetes is purely a genetic effect acting through inheritance or whether it can also act as an environmental factor, for example through foetal exposure in utero to maternal circulating cells. METHODS: We analysed the non-transmitted parental HLA DQ alleles of 464 families (1367 subjects) with a Type I diabetic offspring. HLA DQ alleles were assessed using sequence-specific primers and allele-specific oligonucleotides hybridisation. A chi-square test was done to compare allele and transmission frequencies in the respective subsets of families. RESULTS: The non-transmitted HLA DR3-DQ2 and DR4-DQ8 were more frequent in mothers than in fathers of all non	DQ2/DQ8 heterozygous diabetic offspring ( p=0.0001) as well as in offspring not carrying any HLA high-risk allele ( p=0.0243). In patients with either risk allele alone, more maternal than paternal non-transmitted risk alleles complemented the constellation to DQ2/DQ8 ( p&lt;0.0099). CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: HLA high risk alleles were more frequent among maternal non-inherited (but possibly exposed) alleles than among paternal non-inherited alleles. These results indicate that HLA DR-DQ is an environmental risk factor for Type I diabetes.

TI	A retroviral long terminal repeat adjacent to the HLA DQB1 gene (DQ-LTR13) modifies Type I diabetes susceptibility on high risk DQ haplotypes.
PG	443-7
AB	AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: HLA-DQ genes, located in the human leukocyte antigen region on chromosome 6 p, are the main inherited factors predisposing to Type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. Endogenous retroviral long-terminal repeats are integrated at several sites within this region, one of which is known to enhance susceptibility for Type I diabetes. We examined another LTR within the HLA-region as an additional genetic risk marker. METHODS: We investigated the segregation of one long-terminal repeat (DQ-LTR13), located 1.3 kb upstream of HLA DQB1 with different HLA-DQ haplotypes, and its transmission to patients. A total of 284 Caucasian families (203 German and 81 Belgian) with at least one diabetic offspring were genotyped for DQA1, DQB1 and DQ-LTR13. RESULTS: DQ8/LTR13(+) was preferentially transmitted (139 transmitted vs 28 not transmitted; P(TDT) = 1.67 x 10(-14)) whereas no deviation from expected transmission frequencies was observed for DQ8/LTR13(-) (20 transmitted vs 17 not transmitted; P(TDT) = 1.00). DQ8/LTR13(+) alleles conferred a significantly higher risk for Type I diabetes than DQ8/LTR13(-) alleles (p chi(2) = 2.58 x 10(-14)). This difference remained significant even after DRB1 subtyping (p chi(2) = 0.02). Also, there was a significant difference when comparing the transmission of DQ2/LTR13(+) and DQ2/LTR13(-) alleles (p chi(2) = 0.01), the latter conferring an increased risk. The transmission of DQ-LTR13(+) haplotypes did not show any differences regarding paternal, maternal or gender-related stratification. However, DQ8/LTR13(-) was significantly more often transmitted from mothers (p chi(2) = 0.01) and to female patients (p chi(2) = 0.04). CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: We conclude that DQ-LTR13 marks additional genetic risk for Type I diabetes on predisposing DRB1(*)0401	DQ8 and DQ2 haplotypes and will help to further define susceptibility in this gene region.

TI	Lack of synergism between long-term poor glycaemic control and three gene polymorphisms of the renin angiotensin system on risk of developing diabetic nephropathy in type I diabetic patients.
PG	794-9
AB	AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Reports on a putative synergism between poor glycaemic control and carriage of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AGTR1) C1166-allele and risk of diabetic nephropathy have been conflicting. Therefore, we investigated the interaction between long-term glycaemic control and three polymorphisms in the genes coding for AGTR1 (A1166--&gt;C), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE/ID) and angiotensinogen (M235T) on risk of developing diabetic nephropathy. Furthermore, we investigated the relation between a random measurement and long-term measurements of haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). METHODS: We studied Caucasian patients with Type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus and nephropathy (120 men 74 women, age 41.1 +/	9.6 years, diabetes duration 28 +/	8 years) and long-standing Type I diabetic patients with persistent normoalbuminuria (112 men 69 women, age 42.5 +/	10.0 years, diabetes duration 27 +/	9 years). Genotyping was PCR-based and metabolic control estimated from all measurements of HbA1c done in each patient [average (range) n = 31 (6-74)]. The median observation time (range) was 13.5 (2-14) years. RESULTS: Type I diabetic patients with a history of poor glycaemic control (HbA1c above the median, 8.7%) had an increased risk of diabetic nephropathy compared with patients with a better metabolic control, OR (95% CI): 9.2 (5.8-14.7). The magnitude of this risk was similar in carriers and non-carriers of the mutations. The risk of nephropathy in patients with HbA1c above compared with below the median in carriers of the mutant C1166-allele, D-allele, or T235-allele were 7.6 (95% CI: 3.9-14.8), 10.4 (6.0-17.8) and 9.8 (5.4-17.9), respectively. A significant correlation (r = 0.74, p &lt; 0.001) existed between a random and long-term measurements of HbA1c with a small mean difference (limits of agreement) [0.2 (-1.8 to 2.1)%] between the two estimates. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Poor metabolic control is a major risk factor for diabetic nephropathy in Caucasian Type I diabetic patients. This risk was similar in carriers and non-carriers of the mutant alleles of the AGTR1 (A1166--&gt;C), ACE/ID and angiotensinogen-M235T polymorphisms. The HbA1c value measured at random reflects rather closely average long-term HbA1c values.

TI	Maternal diabetes alters birth weight in glucokinase-deficient (MODY2) kindred but has no influence on adult weight, height, insulin secretion or insulin sensitivity.
PG	1060-3
AB	AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Altered fetal insulin secretion caused by fetal or maternal glucokinase mutations influence birth weight. Here, we attempt to answer two additional questions: firstly, whether this variation in birth weight (from low birth weight to macrosomia) has an effect on adult height or weight. Secondly, whether maternal hyperglycaemia during fetal life has an effect on metabolic phenotypes of the adult offspring. METHODS: We studied 447 family members from 37 MODY2 kindred, divided into four groups according to the presence or absence of a glucokinase mutation in the subject (S+ or S-, respectively) and his/her mother (M+ or M-). Birth weight data were obtained from a questionnaire sent to the mothers. RESULTS: Birth weight was reduced in the presence of a fetal mutation (M-S+) and increased in the presence of a maternal mutation (M+ S-). These effects are additive as similar birth weights were observed in M+ S+ and M-S	offspring. Adult height, weight or body mass index (weight/height2) were, however, similar in the four groups of subjects. Non-diabetic adult offspring, regardless of the glycaemic status of the mothers (M+ S	or M-S-), had similar insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity, blood pressures and lipid profiles. These variables as well as the severity of hyperglycaemia were similar in adult M+ S+ and M-S+ MODY2 subjects. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Maternal environment and fetal genotypes could alter growth in utero by changing fetal insulin secretion but these effects do not result in a persistent programming in latter life.

TI	Search for variants of the gene-promoter and the potential phosphotyrosine encoding sequence of the insulin receptor substrate-2 gene: evaluation of their relation with alterations in insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity.
PG	1244-9
AB	AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this study was to screen part of the putative promoter sequence in addition to 14 potential phosphotyrosine residues of human IRS-2 for genetic variability which might cause changes in protein expression or function. Furthermore, the potential impact on insulin secretion and sensitivity of a previously identified IRS-2 variant (Gly1057Asp) was analysed. METHODS: The screenings were carried out by the SSCP-heteroduplex technique on DNA from Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetic patients. The impact of the Gly1057Asp variant was analysed in four glucose-tolerant Scandinavian study groups. RESULTS: The results showed no nucleotide substitutions in the promoter sequence, however, a novel heterozygous amino acid variant was identified (Leu647Val). In an association study, the new variant was found in 3 of 413 diabetic patients and in none of 280 glucose tolerant subjects. The variant did not affect the binding of IRS-2 to the insulin receptor or p85alpha of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase when measured in the yeast two-hybrid system. Examination of the common Gly1057Asp variant in 363 young healthy subjects and in 228 glucose tolerant offspring of one diabetic parent showed no differences in insulin secretion or insulin sensitivity after an intravenous glucose tolerance test. Glucose tolerant middle-aged subjects homozygous for the polymorphism (n = 31), however, had on average a 25 % decrease in fasting serum insulin concentrations (p = 0.009) and 28 % (p = 0.01) and 34 % (p = 0.003) reductions in serum insulin concentrations at 30 and 60 min, respectively, during an OGTT compared with wildtype carriers (n = 107). In a cohort of 639 elderly Swedish men the amino acid variant did not have any detectable impact on insulin secretion after an OGTT. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: No genetic variability was found in the IRS-2 promoter. A rare IRS-2 variant at codon 647 has been identified in Type II diabetic patients. The prevalent codon 1057 polymorphism had no consistent effect on insulin secretion or insulin sensitivity. [Diabetologia (1999) 42: 1244-1249]

TI	The C825T polymorphism in the human G-protein beta3 subunit gene is not associated with diabetic nephropathy in Type I diabetes mellitus.
PG	1304-8
AB	In Type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus a genetic predisposition exists to nephropathy and is related to parental hypertension. Enhanced G-protein activation, a cellular phenotype observed in cultured cells from patients with essential hypertension, was recently documented in Type I diabetic subjects with nephropathy. This enhanced G-protein activation has been associated with a genetic variant in the G-protein beta3 subunit, GNB3. A C--&gt;T polymorphism at position 825 in exon 10 is associated with G-protein activation, the T allele associated with enhanced activity. Furthermore the T allele was observed more frequently in a group with essential hypertension. In this report we have analysed the role of the C825T polymorphism in the predisposition to diabetic nephropathy in Type I diabetes. We have investigated the frequency of this polymorphism in a large case-control study and found no association of the T allele with diabetic nephropathy. Specifically carriage of the T allele as CT or TT was observed in 49% of 200 Type I diabetic control subjects with normoalbuminuria (diabetes duration 24 years) compared with 53% of 216 Type I diabetic subjects with nephropathy (overt proteinuria or end-stage renal failure). Within this group we have also examined the inheritance of C825T alleles in a family study and found no evidence for excess transmission of the T allele to Type I diabetic offspring with nephropathy (T allele transmitted to 51% of nephropathy offspring, C allele transmitted to 49% of nephropathy offspring, p = 0.79). In none of the Type I diabetic datasets examined was there any effect of genotype on variation in systolic or diastolic blood pressure. In conclusion we can find no evidence for the C825T polymorphism of the beta3 G-protein subunit as a major gene in the susceptibility to diabetic nephropathy in Type I diabetes.

TI	Low birth weight is associated with NIDDM in discordant monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs.
PG	439-46
AB	Previous studies have demonstrated an association between low weight at birth and risk of later development of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It is not known whether this association is due to an impact of intrauterine malnutrition per se, or whether it is due to a coincidence between the putative &quot;NIDDM susceptibility genotype&quot; and a genetically determined low weight at birth. It is also unclear whether differences in gestational age, maternal height, birth order and/or sex could explain the association. Twins are born of the same mother and have similar gestational ages. Furthermore, monozygotic (MZ) twins have identical genotypes. Original midwife birth weight record determinations were traced in MZ and dizygotic (DZ) twins discordant for NIDDM. Birth weights were lower in the NIDDM twins (n = 2 x 14) compared with both their identical (MZ; n = 14) and non-identical (DZ; n = 14) non-diabetic co-twins, respectively (MZ: mean +/	SEM 2634 +/	135 vs 2829 +/	131 g, p &lt; 0.02; DZ: 2509 +/	135 vs 2854 +/	168 g, p &lt; 0.02). Using a similar approach in 39 MZ and DZ twin pairs discordant for impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), no significantly lower birth weights were detected in the IGT twins compared with their normal glucose tolerant co-twins. However, when a larger group of twins with different glucose tolerance were considered, birth weights were lower in the twins with abnormal glucose tolerance (NIDDM + IGT; n = 106; 2622 +/	45 g) and IGT (n = 62: 2613 +/	55 g) compared with twins with normal glucose tolerance (n = 112: 2800 +/	51 g; p = 0.01 and p = 0.03, respectively). Furthermore, the twins with the lowest birth weights among the two co-twins had the highest plasma glucose concentrations 120 min after the 75-g oral glucose load (n = 86 pairs: 9.6 +/	0.6 vs 8.0 +/	0.4 mmol/l, p = 0.03). In conclusion, the association between low birth weight and NIDDM in twins is at least partly independent of genotype and may be due to intrauterine malnutrition. IGT was also associated with low birth weight in twins. However, the possibility cannot be excluded that the association between low birth weight and IGT could be due to a coincidence with a certain genotype causing both low birth weight and IGT in some subjects.

TI	Association of aldehyde dehydrogenase with inheritance of NIDDM.
PG	1115-8
AB	To investigate the influence of the mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) genotype on the clinical features of diabetes, 212 Japanese patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) (154 males and 58 females aged 17-83 years; mean age 58.2 years) were investigated. Genotyping of ALDH2 was performed by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. The pattern of inheritance of diabetes and various clinical parameters was compared between active and inactive ALDH2 groups. Of the 212 subjects, 120 had active ALDH2 and 92 had inactive ALDH2. The percentage of patients with a diabetic mother was higher in the inactive ALDH2 group (32.6%) than in the active ALDH2 group (19.2%) (p &lt; 0.05). The prevalence of proliferative retinopathy was lower in the inactive ALDH2 group than in the active ALDH2 group (p &lt; 0.05). However, other clinical parameters showed no difference. We conclude that maternal inheritance of diabetes was common in the inactive ALDH2 group. The finding is suggestive of a relationship between alcohol intolerance and inheritance of diabetes. We speculate that the interaction between mitochondrial DNA and ALDH2 inactivity causes an increase of mitochondrial DNA mutations or deletions, thereby inducing the maternal inheritance of diabetes. The relationship of the ALDH2 genotype with proliferative retinopathy is interesting, because it resembles that of chlorpropamide alcohol flushing with severe diabetic retinopathy. The interaction of aldehyde dehydrogenase isoenzymes might have an aetiological role, since aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 plays an important part in oxidation of retinal to retinoic acid. However, the number of affected patients with proliferative retinopathy was small, hence, our result should be considered as a preliminary finding.

TI	Parental imprinting effect at the INS-IGF2 diabetes susceptibility locus.
PG	715-9
AB	Although association of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with a haplotype at a locus encompassing the genes for insulin and the insulin-like growth factor II has been well established, two major studies disagree as to whether linkage to this locus is confined to paternally inherited alleles, or is present in alleles transmitted from either parental sex. Towards resolving this discrepancy, we examined parent-of-origin specific association rather than linkage, using the haplotype relative risk method in a mixed Caucasian population. We find that the haplotype relative risk (HRR) conferred by paternal chromosomes was much higher (5.1, p &lt; 0.01) than the corresponding maternal value (2.3, p = 0.07), which narrowly failed to reach statistical significance. Thus, although we cannot exclude an effect of the maternal allele, such an effect appears to be considerably weaker. We review evidence that parental imprinting is genotype-dependent, which may explain the different degrees to which the paternal effect is seen in different populations.

TI	Patients with lipodystrophic diabetes mellitus of the Seip-Berardinelli type, express normal insulin receptors.
PG	172-4
AB	Lipodystrophic diabetes mellitus of the Seip-Berardinelli type is a syndrome associated with insulin resistance and recessive inheritance. We have examined whether mutations in the insulin receptor are pathogenetic factors in this syndrome. Fibroblasts from three different patients with Seip-Berardinelli's lipodystrophy were tested for insulin binding, and insulin-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation. In addition, the coding region of both alleles of the iinsulin receptor gene was sequenced. No abnormalities in the number of high affinity insulin binding sites, and insulin-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation were detected. The insulin receptor related insulin-like growth factor I receptor also showed no functional changes. DNA sequence analysis of the amplified exons of the insulin receptor gene showed a silent mutation in patient 1 at codon Ser339, changing AGT to AGC. In patient 2 a heterozygous Met for Val substitution at position 985 was detected, which is a rare polymorphism. In patient 3 no mutations, other than described polymorphisms, were observed. These findings demonstrate that the primary genetic lesion in Seip-Berardinelli's lipodystrophy is outside the insulin receptor gene and that an involvement of the insulin-like growth factor I receptor is also unlikely.

TI	Analysis of polymorphisms in genes (AGT, MTHFR, GPIIIa, and GSTP1) associated with hypertension, thrombophilia and oxidative stress in Mestizo and Amerindian populations of Mexico.
PG	323-31
AB	Several polymorphisms related to hypertension, thrombophilia, and oxidative stress has been associated with the development of cardiovascular disease. We analyzed the frequency of M235T angiotensinogen (AGT), A222V 5,10 methylenete-trahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), L33P glycoprotein IIIa (GPIIIa), and I105V glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1)} polymorphisms in 285 individuals belonging to Mexican-Mestizo and five Amerindian population from Mexico, by real time PCR allelic discrimination. Allele and genotype frequencies were compared using chi square tests. All populations followed the Hardy Weinberg equilibrium for assay markers with the exception of the Triki, whose were in Hardy Weinberg dysequilibrium for the glutathione S-transferase P1 polymorphism. Interestingly, according to all the analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the Triki population was the most differentiated and homogeneous group of the six populations analyzed. A comparison of our data with those previously published for some Caucasian, Asian and Black populations showed quite significant differences. These differences were remarkable with all the Mexican populations having a lower frequency of the 105V allele of the glutathione S-transferase P1 and reduced occurrence of the 222A allele of the 5,10 methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase. Our results show the genetic diversity among different Mexican populations and with other racial groups.

TI	Protective effect of R allele of PON1 gene on the coronary artery disease in the presence of specific genetic background.
PG	81-8
AB	BACKGROUND: Genetic susceptibility to CAD may be determined by polymorphic variants of genes encoding isoforms involved in the processes important in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, including lipids disorders. Participation of single polymorphic variants is relatively small, however its significance may increase in the presence of specific genetic or environmental background. AIM: The aim of the study was an evaluation a possible association between single polymorphic variants of PON1, APOE, ABCA1 and PPARA genes and CAD and looking for specific multigene genotype patterns which differentiate study groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 358 subjects:178 patients with angiographically confirmed CAD and 180 blood donors without history of CAD. Polymorphisms were genotyped using PCR-RFLP method. RESULTS: We observed statistically significant differences in the frequencies of R allele and R allele carriers of PON1 gene between CAD and controls. The distribution of genotypes and alleles of other analyzed genes did not differentiate the study groups, however the presence of specific genotypes (APOE&amp; ndash; epsilon3epsilon3, epsilon3epsilon2, ABCA1	AG, PPARA	GG) increased the protective effect of R allele. CONCLUSION: The present study revealed an independent protective association between carrier-state of PON1 R allele and CAD. This protective effect was especially strong in the presence of specific genotype arrangements of other analyzed genes.

TI	Non-HLA genetic factors and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus in the Japanese: TCRA, TCRB and TCRG, INS, THY1, CD3D and ETS1.
PG	283-94
AB	Polymorphism of the genes encoding the alpha, beta, and gamma chains of the human T-cell receptor (TCRA, TCRB, and TCRG), insulin gene (INS), and three closely linked polymorphic genes on chromosome 11q23, Thy-1 (THY1), T3-D (CD3D), and c-ets proto oncogene (ETS1) were investigated among 56 unrelated patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and 48 healthy controls. Only eight of the 17 enzymes examined revealed restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), with the use of TCRA, TCRB, and TCRG. No significant association was observed. Polymorphism after BglI, SstI, and TaqI digestion was observed for the INS gene. In consideration of the three classes within the insulin-gene-linked DNA polymorphism alleles, A1 and more rarely A2 alleles were found, but with no significant frequencies. THY1 and CD3D genes were polymorphic after MspI digestion but no significant association was observed. Conversely, the ETS1 gene showed polymorphism after TaqI, SstI, and AvaII were used. Only a significant AvaII-polymorphic fragment (p less than 0.03) was found. However, this significant association disappeared when the correct p value was applied. These results were compared to findings in Caucasians and some differences were noted. The polymorphism observed in this study may be useful in genetic studies on immunologically affected populations.

TI	Induction of pancreatic beta-cell-like cells from CD44+/CD105+ human amniotic fluids via epigenetic regulation of the pancreatic and duodenal homeobox factor 1 promoter.
PG	739-48
AB	Pancreatic and duodenal homeobox factor 1 (PDX-1) maintains beta-cell function and differentiation via direct regulation of multiple islet cell genes. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in this process remain unknown. Here, we show that PDX-1 plays an important role in the induction of CD44+/CD105+ human amniotic fluid cells (HuAFCs) into functional pancreatic beta-cell-like cells in vitro. CD44+/CD105+ HuAFCs were transfected with either siRNA targeting PDX-1 (siRNA-PDX-1) or mock plasmid (siRNA-MOCK). Following induction, siRNA-MOCK-transfected cells differentiated into beta-cell-like cells that expressed multiple islet cell markers and produced insulin and C-peptide in a glucose-regulated manner. However, siRNA-PDX-1-transfected cells did not fully differentiate into beta-cell-like cells. Further, we observed epigenetic changes at the PDX-1 gene locus in induced CD44(+)/CD105(+) HuAFCs. Therefore, CD44+/CD105+ HuAFCs could be a source of human pancreatic beta-cell-like cells with potential uses in cell replacement therapy for diabetes.

TI	Vascular endothelial growth factor haplotypes associated with childhood obesity.
PG	709-14
AB	Expansion of adipose tissue in obesity is associated with angiogenesis and adipose tissue mass depends on neovascularization. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the main angiogenic factor in the adipose tissue, and VEGF expression is tightly regulated at both transcriptional and translational levels. However, no previous study has tested the hypothesis that genetic polymorphisms in the VEGF gene could affect susceptibility to obesity. To test this hypothesis, we compared the distribution of genotypes and haplotypes including three VEGF genetic polymorphisms in obese children and adolescents with those found in healthy controls. We studied 172 healthy children and adolescents and 113 obese children and adolescents. Genotypes of three clinically relevant VEGF polymorphisms in the promoter region (C-2578A, G-1154A, and G-634C) of the VEGF gene were determined by TaqMan allele discrimination assay and real-time polymerase chain reaction. VEGF haplotypes were inferred using Haplo.stats and PHASE 2.1 programs. We found no differences in the distributions of VEGF genotypes and alleles (p &gt; 0.05). However, the CAG haplotype was more frequent in the obese group than in the control group (4% versus 0%, respectively, in white subjects; p = 0.008; odds ratio = 10.148 (95% confidence interval: 1.098-93.788). Our findings suggest that VEGF haplotypes affect susceptibility to obesity in children and adolescents.

TI	Global DNA methylation patterns in placenta and its association with maternal hypertension in pre-eclampsia.
PG	79-84
AB	Maternal nutrition is an important determinant of one-carbon metabolism that lies at the heart of intrauterine epigenetic programming. Exchange of nutrients and other vital molecules between the mother and fetus takes place across the placenta and hence may play direct role in fetal programming. Pre-eclampsia (PE) originates in the placenta and altered maternal nutrition may influence epigenetic patterns in the placenta, thereby affecting birth outcome. In the present study, we investigated the global DNA methylation levels in placentas of pre-eclampsia women (i.e., women delivering at term and those delivering preterm) and studied their associations with maternal blood pressure and birth outcome. Increased homocysteine and global DNA methylation levels were seen in the pre-eclampsia group (term and preterm PE) when compared with the normotensive group (p &lt; 0.05). A positive association between global DNA methylation and systolic (p &lt; 0.01) and diastolic (p &lt; 0.05) blood pressure was seen in the term pre-eclampsia group, whereas there was no association with birth outcome. The study for the first time provides evidence for altered global DNA methylation patterns in pre-eclampsia placentas and its association with blood pressure. It is possible that increased homocysteine levels may be related to increased methylation in pre-eclampsia.

TI	Interethnic differences in the distribution of clinically relevant vascular endothelial growth factor genetic polymorphisms.
PG	567-72
AB	Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a homodimeric glycoprotein produced mostly in endothelial cells and its transcription is regulated by a variety of growth factors and cytokines. VEGF plays many relevant roles, and three functional polymorphisms in the promoter region of the VEGF gene (C-2578A, G-1154A, and G-634C) have been associated with disease conditions. Although some studies suggest that interethnic differences exist in the distribution of these variants, no previous study has examined this hypothesis in admixed populations. We examined the distribution of these three clinically relevant VEGF single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 175 white and 185 black subjects. We have also estimated the haplotype distribution and assessed associations between these variants. Although the A-2578 and A-1154 variants were more common in whites (39% and 29%, respectively) than in blacks (29% and 16%, respectively; both p &lt; 0.05), no significant interethnic differences were found with regards to the G-634C polymorphism. While the haplotype including the C-2578, G-1154, and G-634 variants was the most common in both ethnic groups, it was more common in blacks than in whites (p &lt; 0.05). The haplotype including the C-2578, A-1154, and G-634 alleles and the haplotype including the C-2578, A-1154, and C-634 alleles were more common in whites than in blacks (both p &lt; 0.05). These results show marked interethnic differences in the distribution of genetic variants of VEGF that may explain, at least in part, interethnic disparities in the susceptibility to cardiovascular diseases.

TI	[Recent advances in the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus].
PG	172-5
AB	INTERVENTIONAL APPROACHES TO BETA CELL PRESERVATION: In a pilot study, initial attempts at primary prevention by preserving islet beta cells have been successful with highly hydrolyzed milk formula in children who are at high genetic risk of diabetes. Attempts at secondary prevention by intranasal application in children with a high-risk HLA genotype and positive islet autoantibodies have been disappointing. But in tertiary prevention anti-inflammatory, antigen-directed and T-cell targeted treatment has been partially successful in slowing down the destruction of beta cells. BIOLOGICAL BETA CELL SUBSTITUTION: Transplantation of a vascularised pancreas or islet cells results in disease regression and the prevention of secondary/tertiary complications of diabetes. A principal aim is the avoidance of frequent, severe hypoglycaemic episodes resulting from markedly reduced awareness of hypoglycaemia or its counter-regulation.

TI	Clinical evidence of intrauterine disturbance in Prader-Willi syndrome, a genetically imprinted neurodevelopmental disorder.
PG	471-8
AB	BACKGROUND: Imprinted genes are considered to play an important role in growth and early development but much of the research is based on animal studies. AIM: This study reports clinical data from a French population concerning prenatal, perinatal and postnatal complications in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), a genetically imprinted neurodevelopmental disorder associated with growth retardation, intellectual impairment and obesity. STUDY DESIGN: Data from family health records concerning prenatal, perinatal and postnatal complications were collected from 52 French people with the deletion form (DEL), and 34 French people with the maternal disomy form of PWS (UPD) and compared against national norms and between groups. RESULTS: Significant findings include: a history of miscarriage, high rate of polyhydramnios (12/34 UPD, 11/52 DEL), a high rate of induced labour, a high rate of Caesarian section (20/34 UPD, 26/52 DEL), small gestational age (10/34 UPD, 22/52 DEL), hypotonia (34/34 UPD, 49/52 DEL), and suckling deficit (25/34 UPD, 46/52 DEL). Significant differences between genetic subtypes include a higher rate of induced labour in UPD (27/34 UPD, 25/52 DEL), an increased risk of premature term in UPD (9/34 UPD vs. 4/52 DEL), raised maternal age in UPD (36.4 years vs. 29.3 years), low birth weight for newborns with a deletion form of PWS (girls 2.8 kg, boys 2.7 kg), a positive correlation between parental weight and offspring birth weight only for patients with UPD (UPD maternal: r=0.62, paternal: r=0.51). CONCLUSION: The results indicate significant intrauterine disturbance in PWS, particularly in PWS due to UPD, but a more significant weight disturbance for PWS due to deletion.

TI	A mutation (R826W) in nucleotide-binding domain 1 of ABCC8 reduces ATPase activity and causes transient neonatal diabetes.
PG	648-54
AB	Activating mutations in the pore-forming Kir6.2 (KCNJ11) and regulatory sulphonylurea receptor SUR1 (ABCC8) subunits of the K(ATP) channel are a common cause of transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM). We identified a new TNDM mutation (R826W) in the first nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1) of SUR1. The mutation was found in a region that heterodimerizes with NBD2 to form catalytic site 2. Functional analysis showed that this mutation decreases MgATP hydrolysis by purified maltose-binding protein MBP-NBD1 fusion proteins. Inhibition of ATP hydrolysis by MgADP or BeF was not changed. The results indicate that the ATPase cycle lingers in the post-hydrolytic MgADP.P(i)-bound state, which is associated with channel activation. The extent of MgADP-dependent activation of K(ATP) channel activity was unaffected by the R826W mutation, but the time course of deactivation was slowed. Channel inhibition by MgATP was reduced, leading to an increase in resting whole-cell currents. In pancreatic beta cells, this would lead to less insulin secretion and thereby diabetes.

TI	ATGL has a key role in lipid droplet/adiposome degradation in mammalian cells.
PG	106-13
AB	Lipid droplets (LDs), also called adiposomes, are found in many eukaryotic cells, and are highly upregulated in lipid-storage cells, such as adipocytes. The mechanism by which adiposomes and their component neutral lipids are degraded is an important health issue with the rapidly spreading epidemic of obesity. Recently, a novel triglyceride lipase (adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL)) that catalyses the initial step in triglyceride hydrolysis in adipocyte LDs was identified. Here, we show that ATGL also functions in non-adipocyte cells, and has an important role in LD degradation in these cells. Overexpression of wild-type ATGL causes a marked decrease in LD size, whereas a catalytically inactive mutant retains the ability to localize to LDs, but is unable to decrease their size. Depletion of ATGL by RNA interference leads to a significant increase in the size of LDs. These results show that ATGL has an important role in LD/adiposome turnover in mammalian cells.

TI	Management of neonatal and infancy-onset diabetes mellitus.
PG	94-105
AB	Diabetes mellitus is a rare disorder during the first 2 years of life, amounting to about 3-5% of all cases diagnosed before the fifteenth birthday. However, in spite of low numerical values, this is an important diagnosis, since we are dealing with a vulnerable age group with major and special problems related to diagnosis, treatment and psychosocial follow-up. Efforts should be made to establish a molecular genetic diagnosis as early as possible (e.g. homozygous glucokinase deficiency, defects of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel, chromosome 6 imprinting abnormalities). This is particularly important, since patients with Kir6.2 and SUR1 defects can now be treated with oral sulfonylureas. Major advancements have been obtained and continue to be made with respect to diagnosis and classification. Differentiation between transient and permanent neonatal diabetes can only be done after long-term follow-up. Patients should be scrutinized for comorbidity (e.g. celiac disease, Wolcott-Rallison syndrome). Type 1 diabetes is probably the most prevalent subtype, particularly after the first year of life. Insulin treatment in infancy continues to represent major technical, medical and psychological challenges. Family support is mandatory and close attention should be paid to psychosocial issues.

TI	Imprinting in human disease with special reference to transient neonatal diabetes and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.
PG	113-23
AB	There are at least 6 well-studied imprinting domains on human autosomes. Each domain is under the regulatory control of an 'imprinting centre' that harbours a differentially methylated region. A number of molecular mechanisms result in differential silencing of some genes within these domains and gene expression is tightly regulated in normal individuals. However, this makes them vulnerable to naturally occurring genetic and epigenetic aberrations. Nine recognisable developmental syndromes have been described due to abnormalities within these 6 domains: transient neonatal diabetes (TND; at 6q24); Beckwith	Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) and Silver-Russell syndrome (at 11p15.5; 2 imprinted domains); maternal and paternal uniparental disomy syndromes (at 14q32); Angelman and Prader-Willi syndromes (at 15q11-13), and pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1b (at 20q12-13). Furthermore, it is now recognised that involvement at multiple domains can occur simultaneously and result in what has been described as the hypomethylation syndrome. TND and BWS are discussed in more detail as examples of imprinting disorders.

TI	Correlation between clinical phenotypes and X-inactivation patterns in six female carriers with heterozygote vasopressin type 2 receptor gene mutations.
PG	277-84
AB	About 90% of patients with congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) have vasopressin type 2 receptor (V2R) gene mutations that are inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. Although most female carriers are asymptomatic, some female carriers show polydipsia and polyuria. The reason why female carriers show NDI symptoms is explained by skewed X-inactivation. We studied X-inactivation patterns of six female carriers with heterozygote V2R gene mutations. The X-inactivation pattern in peripheral blood leukocytes was examined using methylation analysis of the polymorphic CAG repeat in the androgen receptor gene. Two asymptomatic female carriers showed random X-inactivation (61.9% and 60.7%). Skewed X-inactivation patterns (71.6%, 79.4%, and 91.2%) occurring preferentially to normal X alleles were recognized in three female carriers who showed clinical NDI symptoms. However, in one female carrier who showed clinical NDI symptoms, random X-inactivation (55.4%) was recognized. In conclusion, the clinical NDI phenotypes may correlate with the X-inactivation patterns in female carriers with heterozygote V2R gene mutations. However, in some female carriers, we cannot predict the clinical phenotypes by the evaluation of the X-inactivation patterns in peripheral blood leukocytes, because X-inactivation ratios within an individual are sometimes different between tissues.

TI	Epigenetic analysis of HIC1, CASP8, FLIP, TSP1, DCR1, DCR2, DR4, DR5, KvDMR1, H19 and preferential 11p15.5 maternal-allele loss in von Hippel-Lindau and sporadic phaeochromocytomas.
PG	161-72
AB	Phaeochromocytoma is a neural-crest-derived tumour that may be a feature of several familial cancer syndromes including von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2), neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and germline succinate dehydrogenase subunit (SDHB and SDHD) mutations. However the somatic genetic and epigenetic events that occur in phaeochromocytoma tumourigenesis are not well defined. Epigenetic events including de novo promoter methylation of tumour-suppressor genes are frequent in many human neoplasms. As neuroblastoma and phaeochromocytoma are both neural-crest-derived tumours, we postulated that some epigenetic events might be implicated in both tumour types and wished to establish how somatic epigenetic alterations compared in VHL-associated and sporadic phaeochromocytomas. We identified frequent aberrant methylation of HIC1 (82%) and CASP8 (31%) in phaeochromocytoma, but both genes were significantly more methylated in VHL phaeochromocytomas than in sporadic cases. Of four tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors analysed, DR4 was most commonly methylated (41%; compared with DcR2 (26%), DcR1 (23%) and DR5 (10%)). Gene methylation patterns in phaeochromocytoma and neuroblastoma did not differ significantly suggesting overlapping mechanisms of tumourigenesis. We also investigated the role of 11p15.5-imprinted genes in phaeochromocytoma. We found that in 10 sporadic and VHL phaeochromocytomas with 11p15.5 allele loss, the patterns of methylation of 11p15.5-differentially methylated regions were consistent with maternal, rather than, paternal chromosome loss in all cases (P&lt;0.001). This suggests that 11p15.5-imprinted genes may be implicated in the pathogenesis of both familial (germline VHL and SDHD mutations) and sporadic phaeochromocytomas.

TI	Clinical and genetic analysis for four Chinese families with Prader-Willi syndrome.
PG	37-44
AB	Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex, genetic, multisystem disorder. Its major clinical features include neonatal hypotonia and failure to thrive, mental retardation, hypogonadism, short hands and feet, hyperphagia-caused obesity, and characteristic appearance. The genetic basis of PWS is also complex. It is caused by the absence of expression of the active paternal genes such as the SNRPN, NDN, and possibly others in the PWS critical region on 15q11-13. PWS is in effect a contiguous gene syndrome resulting from deletion of the paternal copies of the imprinted. Consensus in clinical diagnostic criteria was established in 1993. However, identifying relevant patients for tests remains a challenge for most practitioners, as many features of the disorder are nonspecific, and others can be subtle or evolved over time. Consequently, molecular genetic tests can be used to diagnose PWS accurately, allowing early diagnosis of the syndrome. High resolution G-banding, high resolution cytogenetic methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR), and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) are routinely used to diagnose PWS. In this study, four Chinese patients, with typical PWS features, were detected by MS-PCR and FISH. Three were cytogenetically normal, but lacked paternal expression of proximal chromosome 15q because of maternal uniparental disomy (UPD). The other one, however, demonstrated an unbalanced de novo translocation 46, XX, t (7; 15).

TI	The novel compound heterozygous mutations, V434del and W666X, in WFS1 gene causing the Wolfram syndrome in a Chinese family.
PG	151-7
AB	Wolfram syndrome (WFS), also known as DIDMOAD, is an infrequent cause of diabetes mellitus. WFS is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease characterized by various clinical manifestations such as diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, diabetes insipidus, deafness, neurological symptoms, renal tract abnormalities, psychiatric disorders, and gonadal disorders. The majority of patients with WFS carry the loss of function mutations in the WFS1 gene. The exons 2-8 of the WFS1 gene from one Chinese WFS patient were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), subcloning techniques and direct sequence determination was applied to the amplified fragments. The compound heterozygous mutation of a 3-bp (GAC) deletion (V434del) and another compound heterozygous mutation (G--&gt;N)(W666X) in exon 8 of WFS1 gene was identified in the patient. Other seventeen members of her family were investigated. Four cases with heterozygotes had been found through screening for the mutation V434del and five cases for the mutation W666X in the whole family. This is the first report of WFS with the mutation V434del and W666X in the WFS1 gene.

TI	The Pro12Ala polymorphism of the PPAR gamma 2 gene influences sex hormone-binding globulin level and its relationship to the development of the metabolic syndrome in young Finnish men.
PG	185-90
AB	Association of low sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) level with the risk of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) in men has previously been reported. A proline to alanine substitution in codon 12 of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma 2 (PPARgamma2) gene has been shown to be related to high insulin sensitivity. The relationship of SHBG levels with the Pro12Ala polymorphism of PPARgamma2 in men has not been previously studied. Therefore, we investigated the effect of the Pro12Ala polymorphism of PPARgamma2 on SHBG levels in 202 young Finnish men. The range of SHBG was from 3.30 to 73 nmol/L (geometric mean = 17.90; 95%CI = 16.62-19.25 nmol/L). Baseline SHBG levels tended to be lower in men who developed the MetS (n = 11) compared to men who did not develop the MetS (n = 169) (22.85 vs 17.26 nmol/L) on a high-caloric diet during their 6 mo military service. SHBG levels tended to be higher among the subjects with the Ala12Ala genotype compared to subjects with the Pro12Pro or Pro12Ala genotypes of the PPARgamma gene (27.7 vs 21.7 and 22.7 nmol/L). Among the carriers of the Pro12Pro genotype, those who developed the MetS (n = 8) had significantly lower levels of SHBG compared to men who did not develop the MetS (n = 93) (13.23 vs 24.22 nmol/L, p = 0.027). Among the subjects who developed the MetS those with the Pro12Pro genotype (n = 3) had significantly lower levels of SHBG compared to subjects with X12Ala (n = 8) (13.23 vs 28 nmol/L, p = 0.025). We conclude that the 12Ala allele of PPARgamma2 may influence SHBG levels in young Finnish men.

TI	Maternal high-fat diet alters methylation and gene expression of dopamine and opioid-related genes.
PG	4756-64
AB	Maternal obesity during pregnancy increases the risk of obesity in the offspring. Obesity, arising from an imbalance of energy intake and expenditure, can be driven by the ingestion of palatable [high fat (HF), high sugar], energy-dense foods. Dopamine and opioid circuitry are neural substrates associated with reward that can affect animals' preference for palatable foods. Using a mouse model, the long-term effect of maternal consumption of a HF diet on dopamine and opioid gene expression within the mesocorticolimbic reward circuitry and hypothalamus of the offspring was investigated. Mice from dams fed a HF diet during pregnancy and lactation showed an increased preference for sucrose and fat. Gene expression, measured using quantitative real-time PCR, revealed a significant approximately 3	to 10-fold up-regulation of dopamine reuptake transporter (DAT) in the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, and prefrontal cortex and a down-regulation of DAT in the hypothalamus. Additionally, expression of both mu-opioid receptor (MOR) and preproenkephalin (PENK) was increased in nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex, and hypothalamus of mice from dams that consumed the HF diet. Epigenetic mechanisms have been associated with long-term programming of gene expression after various in utero insults. We observed global and gene-specific (DAT, MOR, and PENK) promoter DNA hypomethylation in the brains of offspring from dams that consumed the HF diet. These data demonstrate that maternal consumption of a HF diet can change the offsprings' epigenetic marks (DNA hypomethylation) in association with long-term alterations in gene expression (dopamine and opioids) and behavior (preference for palatable foods).

TI	Epigenetic changes in the hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin and glucocorticoid receptor genes in the ovine fetus after periconceptional undernutrition.
PG	3652-64
AB	Maternal food restriction is associated with the development of obesity in offspring. This study examined how maternal undernutrition in sheep affects the fetal hypothalamic glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and the appetite-regulating neuropeptides, proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and neuropeptide Y, which it regulates. In fetuses from ewes undernourished from -60 to +30 d around conception, there was increased histone H3K9 acetylation (1.63-fold) and marked hypomethylation (62% decrease) of the POMC gene promoter but no change in POMC expression. In the same group, acetylation of histone H3K9 associated with the hypothalamic GR gene was increased 1.60-fold and the GR promoter region was hypomethylated (53% decrease). In addition, there was a 4.7-fold increase in hypothalamic GR expression but no change in methylation of GR gene expression in the anterior pituitary or hippocampus. Interestingly, hypomethylation of both POMC and GR promoter markers in fetal hypothalami was also identified after maternal undernutrition from -60 to 0 d and -2 to +30 d. In comparison, the Oct4 gene, was hypermethylated in both control and underfed groups. Periconceptional undernutrition is therefore associated with marked epigenetic changes in hypothalamic genes. Increase in GR expression in the undernourished group may contribute to fetal programming of a predisposition to obesity, via altered GR regulation of POMC and neuropeptide Y. These epigenetic changes in GR and POMC in the hypothalamus may also predispose the offspring to altered regulation of food intake, energy expenditure, and glucose homeostasis later in life.

TI	Maternal high-fat diet promotes body length increases and insulin insensitivity in second-generation mice.
PG	4999-5009
AB	Maternal obesity and diet consumption during pregnancy have been linked to offspring adiposity, cardiovascular disease, and impaired glucose metabolism. Furthermore, nutrition during development is clearly linked to somatic growth. However, few studies have examined whether phenotypes derived from maternal high-fat diet exposure can be passed to subsequent generations and by what mechanisms this may occur. Here we report the novel finding of a significant body length increase that persisted across at least two generations of offspring in response to maternal high-fat diet exposure. This phenotype is not attributable to altered intrauterine conditions or maternal feeding behavior because maternal and paternal lineages were able to transmit the effect, supporting a true epigenetic manner of inheritance. We also detected a heritable feature of reduced insulin sensitivity across two generations. Alterations in the GH secretagogue receptor (GHSR), the GHSR transcriptional repressor AF5q31, plasma IGF-I concentrations, and IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP3) suggest a contribution of the GH axis. These studies provide evidence that the heritability of body length and glucose homeostasis are modulated by maternal diet across multiple generations, providing a mechanism where length can increase rapidly in concert with caloric availability.

TI	Maternal genistein alters coat color and protects Avy mouse offspring from obesity by modifying the fetal epigenome.
PG	567-72
AB	Genistein, the major phytoestrogen in soy, is linked to diminished female reproductive performance and to cancer chemoprevention and decreased adipose deposition. Dietary genistein may also play a role in the decreased incidence of cancer in Asians compared with Westerners, as well as increased cancer incidence in Asians immigrating to the United States. Here, we report that maternal dietary genistein supplementation of mice during gestation, at levels comparable with humans consuming high-soy diets, shifted the coat color of heterozygous viable yellow agouti (A(vy/a) offspring toward pseudoagouti. This marked phenotypic change was significantly associated with increased methylation of six cytosine-guanine sites in a retrotransposon upstream of the transcription start site of the Agouti gene. The extent of this DNA methylation was similar in endodermal, mesodermal, and ectodermal tissues, indicating that genistein acts during early embryonic development. Moreover, this genistein-induced hypermethylation persisted into adulthood, decreasing ectopic Agouti expression and protecting offspring from obesity. Thus, we provide the first evidence that in utero dietary genistein affects gene expression and alters susceptibility to obesity in adulthood by permanently altering the epigenome.

TI	Expression discordance of monozygotic twins at birth: effect of intrauterine environment and a possible mechanism for fetal programming.
PG	579-92
AB	Within-pair comparison of monozygotic (MZ) twins provides an ideal model for studying factors that regulate epigenetic profile, by controlling for genetic variation. Previous reports have demonstrated epigenetic variability within MZ pairs, but the contribution of early life exposures to this variation remains unclear. As epigenetic marks govern gene expression, we have used gene expression discordance as a proxy measure of epigenetic discordance in MZ twins at birth in two cell types. We found strong evidence of expression discordance at birth in both cell types and some evidence for higher discordance in twin pairs with separate placentas. Genes previously defined as being involved in response to the external environment showed the most variable expression within pairs, independent of cell type, supporting the idea that even slight differences in intrauterine environment can influence expression profile. Focusing on birthweight, previously identified as a predisposing factor for cardiovascular, metabolic and other complex diseases, and using a statistical model that estimated association based on within-pair variation of expression and birthweight, we found some association between birthweight and expression of genes involved in metabolism and cardiovascular function. This study is the first to examine expression discordance in newborn twins. It provides evidence of a link between birthweight and activity of specific cellular pathways and, as evidence points to gene expression profiles being maintained through cell division by epigenetic factors, provides a plausible biological mechanism for the previously described link between low birthweight and increased risk of later complex disease.

TI	Epilepsy in Prader-Willi syndrome: clinical characteristics and correlation to genotype.
PG	306-10
AB	Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genomic imprinting disease secondary to the loss of a functional paternal copy of 15q11-q13. Unlike its related imprinting disorder, Angelman syndrome, PWS has not been regarded as a risk factor for epilepsy. A retrospective analysis of 92 patients with PWS identified 24 (26%) with seizures. Twenty-two of these (92%) were affected by focal epilepsy and only two (8%) had generalized epilepsy. The most common seizure type was staring spells (67%). Correlation to genotype analysis showed deletions were more common in patients with epilepsy than in patients without epilepsy. The epilepsy syndromes were easy to control with a single antiepileptic drug in most cases. Three patients (11%) had had febrile seizures. These findings suggest that PWS may be a risk factor for epilepsy, which can manifest with focal features. Patients with PWS with a deletion genotype showed a trend toward developing seizures compared with patients with other genotypes in our series, even though this difference did not achieve statistical significance.

TI	From monogenic to polygenic obesity: recent advances.
PG	297-310
AB	The heritability of obesity and body weight in general is high. A small number of confirmed monogenic forms of obesity-the respective mutations are sufficient by themselves to cause the condition in food abundant societies-have been identified by molecular genetic studies. The elucidation of these genes, mostly based on animal and family studies, has led to the identification of important pathways to the disorder and thus to a deeper understanding of the regulation of body weight. The identification of inborn deficiency of the mostly adipocyte-derived satiety hormone leptin in extremely obese children from consanguineous families paved the way to the first pharmacological therapy for obesity based on a molecular genetic finding. The genetic predisposition to obesity for most individuals, however, has a polygenic basis. A polygenic variant by itself has a small effect on the phenotype; only in combination with other predisposing variants does a sizeable phenotypic effect arise. Common variants in the first intron of the 'fat mass and obesity associated' gene (FTO) result in an elevated body mass index (BMI) equivalent to approximately +0.4 kg/m(2) per risk allele. The FTO variants were originally detected in a genome wide association study (GWAS) pertaining to type 2 diabetes mellitus. Large meta-analyses of GWAS have subsequently identified additional polygenic variants. Up to December 2009, polygenic variants have been confirmed in a total of 17 independent genomic regions. Further study of genetic effects on human body weight regulation should detect variants that will explain a larger proportion of the heritability. The development of new strategies for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of obesity can be anticipated.

TI	Identification of specific tumor necrosis factor-alpha-susceptible and -protective haplotypes associated with the risk of type 1 diabetes.
PG	285-91
AB	AIM: We investigated the association of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha gene polymorphism with type 1 diabetes (T1D). METHODS: TNF-alpha -1031T/C, -863C/A, -857C/T, -376G/A, -308G/A, -238G/A, and +488G/A single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were assessed in 198 T1DM patients and 180 age-and gender-matched, normoglycemic control subjects using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). RESULTS: Higher frequencies of -863A (p = 8.0 x 10-6), -857T (p = 1.4 x 10-4), and -238A (p = 0.002) alleles were seen in T1D patients than in the control group. Significant differences were noted in the distribution of -863T/C, -857C/T, -376G/A, -308G/A, and -238G/A genotypes between patients and controls. Haploview analysis revealed high linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the -376G/A and -308G/A SNPs, but this was lower between the other polymorphisms. Five-locus TNFalpha haplotypes were constructed based on the prevalence of individual SNPs and the LD between them. An increased frequency of CTGGG, CCGAG, and ACGGG haplotypes, and a reduced frequency of the CCGGG haplotype was seen in patients. When the Bonferroni correction was applied, differences were significant for the CTGGG (Pc = 1.4 x 10-3), CCGAG (Pc = 0.023), and ACGGG (Pc = 1.2 x 10-3) haplotypes which were greater, and the CCGGG haplotype (Pc = 3.8 x 10-5) which was smaller, among T1D patients, thereby conferring susceptibility to and protection from T1D, respectively. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that TNF-alpha polymorphisms, in particular -863C/A, -857C/T, and -238G/A, are significantly associated with T1D. Additional studies, on other racial groups, are needed to confirm our findings.

TI	Proinflammatory cytokine gene polymorphisms in Behcet's disease.
PG	292-6
AB	Behcet's disease (BD) is a chronic, systemic disease, characterized by oral and genital lesions, and ocular inflammation. There is evidence indicating altered levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in patients with BD. This study involved 150 patients with BD and 140 healthy controls, and investigated the role of proinflammatory cytokine gene polymorphisms in the disease. The frequency of the TNF-alpha (-238) G/G genotype was significantly higher in the patient group, compared to the controls (p &lt; 0.001), whilst the G/A genotype was significantly lower in the patients with BD (p &lt; 0.001). Patients with BD showed a significant increase in the TNF-alpha (	308,	238) GG haplotype (p &lt; 0.001), whilst there was a significant decrease in the GA haplotype (p &lt; 0.001). The heterozygous, IL-6 (	174) C/G genotype (p = 0.005), and the IL-6 (	174, nt565) haplotype CG (p &lt; 0.001), were significantly decreased in the patient group. The increased production of proinflammatory cytokines in BD could be a consequence of specific, cytokine gene polymorphisms. Particular genotypes and haplotypes in TNF-alpha were over-represented in BD, which may, in turn, predispose individuals to this disease.

TI	Association between interleukin-6 polymorphism and age-at-onset of type 1 diabetes. Epistatic influences of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta polymorphisms.
PG	277-81
AB	Multiple immune mediators have been mentioned as playing a role in the pathomechanism of type1 DM. Interleukin (IL)-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha play a central role in the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta-cells, whereas IL-6 inhibits TNF-alpha secretion, and may have some protecting effects. In our study, we aimed to investigate the association between these three cytokines' single nucleotide polymorphisms (IL-6 gene G(-174)C, TNF-alpha gene G(-308)A and IL-1beta gene C(3954)T polymorphisms) and age-at-onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in 165 diabetic children (median age: 17 years). Polymorphisms were determined using the PCR-RFLP method. We found that the age-at-onset of T1DM was significantly different in patients with a different IL-6 genotype (median age-at-onset of T1DM was: 8, 6 and 4.5 years in children with the (-174)GG, GC and CC genotypes, respectively; p &lt; 0.01). Adjusted for TNF-alpha and IL-1beta polymorphisms, patients with a IL-6 (-174)CC genotype have a 3.0-fold (95% CI: 1.2-7.1) increased risk of developing diabetes before the age of 6 years than (-174)G allele carrier patients. However, we found this association to be present only in patients who carried the TNF-alpha (-308)A or IL-1beta (3954)T allele, i.e. in patients with high TNF-alpha and high IL-1beta producer genotypes. We suppose that in the case of high TNF-alpha and IL-1beta producer genotypes, elevated proinflammatory cytokine levels result in a higher production of IL-6 in (-174)G allele carrier patients. This elevated IL-6 level may have a protective effect against the development of T1DM and may delay the destruction of pancreatic beta-cells.

TI	Sudden cardiac death in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Variability in phenotypic expression of beta-myosin heavy chain mutations.
PG	368-76
AB	BACKGROUND: Recent identification of mutations in the beta-myosin heavy chain gene (MYH7), a major responsible gene for HCM, has provided the opportunity to characterize genotype-phenotype correlation in HCM families. In this study we analysed the phenotypic expression of two beta-myosin heavy chain (beta MHC) mutations in three unrelated HCM families. METHODS: Living individuals from three unrelated HCM families (Families 1, 2, and 3) were screened by history, physical examination, electrocardiography, and two-dimensional echocardiography. Blood was collected from all individuals for DNA extraction. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), restriction endonuclease digestion and chemical cleavage were utilized for detection of mutations. All mutations were confirmed by sequence analysis. RESULTS: Identification of mutations: A missense mutation in exon 13 of the beta MHC gene (Arg403 Gln) was detected in HCM patients from Families 1 and 2. PCR amplification of the exon 13 DNA, followed by Ddel digestion of the PCR product and gel electrophoresis, showed two fragments of 84 and 70 bp in normal individuals and four fragments of 84, 70, 52 and 32 bp in HCM patients. Sequence analysis showed substitution of an adenine for guanine at coding position 1208. In Family 3, a missense mutation in exon 16 of the beta MHC gene (Val606 Met) was detected in HCM patients. Chemical cleavage of the PCR products showed an uncleaved product of 337 bp in the normal individuals, while in the affected individuals, in addition to the uncleaved product, a 90 bp cleaved product was also detected, indicating the presence of a mismatch in one allele. Sequence analysis showed substitution of an adenine for guanine in coding position 1817. CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Seven members of Family 1 had HCM, of whom five are alive. One patient died from sudden cardiac death (SCD) and another from recurrent cerebral emboli. In Family 2, 15 individuals had HCM of whom nine have died, seven from SCD. The mean age at the time of SCD was 33 years. The third family is comprised of 11 affected individuals and one obligate carrier, of whom one patient died at age 17 from progressive heart failure. Two additional individuals in this family have also succumbed to SCD to age 60. A variety of clinical and echocardiographic manifestations of HCM were present in each family. Logrank test of Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicates that Arg403 Gln mutation was associated with a poor prognosis in HCM families as compared to Val606 Met (P = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS: beta MHC mutations despite showing variable clinical and echocardiographic manifestations of HCM are predictors of survival in HCM families.

TI	Severe type III hyperlipoproteinemia associated with unusual apolipoprotein E1 phenotype and epsilon 1/'null' genotype.
PG	599-608
AB	A 60-year-old white male (KH) was diagnosed to suffer from severe type III hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP) and premature cardiovascular disease. Biochemical analysis revealed an unusual apolipoprotein (apo) E phenotype and genotype. All clinical characteristics of type III HLP were present in the patient. His very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol to plasma triglyceride (TG) ratio was elevated at 0.97 without therapy which is unusually high (normal ratio about 0.18). By contrast his plasma apo E level was only moderately elevated (6.8 mg dl-1). The patient's apo E migrated in the apo E1 position on isoelectric focusing gels. Chemical modification with cysteamine and treatment with neuraminidase confirmed the presence of two cysteine residues in the patient's apo E and a normal sialylation pattern. Pedigree analysis suggested that the patient was a compound heterozygote with one apo epsilon 1 allele and another allele whose product did not appear in the plasma compartment ('null' allele). Direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified segments of the apo E gene as well as restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis with the endonuclease Taq I identified an adenosine for guanosine (G--&gt;A) exchange in the second base of codon 127 that is predictive for an Asp for Gly substitution in the encoded apo E amino acid sequence. This mutation is the structural basis for the apo E1 isoform identified upon isoelectric focusing. Five other family members are also carriers of the mutant apo epsilon 1 allele. Two of those were hyperlipidemic and exhibited biochemical characteristics of type III HLP. A second mutation, a deletion of a G in codon 31, is predictive for a reading frameshift that encodes for a premature stop in codon 60. Our inability to identify the product of a second apo E allele in the plasma of the patient and two other members of the KH family corresponds with the heterozygous presence of this mutation in the affected individuals. Both relatives (like the index case) had an increased VLDL cholesterol to plasma TG ratio, which indicates the presence of cholesterol-enriched VLDL particles. We propose that the single base deletion in the apo E gene which is the cause of a non-functional 'null' allele in addition to a probably dominant apo E1 (Gly127--&gt;Asp, Arg158--&gt;Cys) variant of late or incomplete penetrance are the primary genetic defects in this kindred leading to severe dysbetalipoproteinemia.

TI	Diabetes caused by insulin gene (INS) deletion: clinical characteristics of homozygous and heterozygous individuals.
PG	255-60
AB	BACKGROUND: Mutations of the preproinsulin gene (INS) account for both permanent neonatal diabetes (PND) and adult-onset diabetes. The molecular mechanism of complete INS deletion has recently been published and we now add clinical data of homozygous and heterozygous subjects as well as the detailed mapping of the 646 bp deletion of the INS gene. METHODS: Location and size of the INS deletion was mapped in one case with PND and INS genotype of the whole family was further characterized by breakpoint-spanning PCR. The phenotype of monoallelic loss of INS was studied in 33 adult family members of a large consanguineous kindred with INS deletion. Results: The 646 bp deletion was found in two individuals with PND that included exons 1 and 2 of the INS gene (chr11: g.2138434_2139080del646) and results in loss of approximately half of the preproinsulin protein. The two boys with homozygous INS deletion (D/D) presented with reduced birth weight, PND within the first 24 h of life and complete absence of C-peptide. Adult family members with the N/D had diabetes onset with earliest 25 years, while the oldest subject without diabetes was 45 years. INS-deletion-diabetes was initially treated with oral antidiabetic drugs but then transferred to insulin within 5-16 years. Overall, N/D-subjects (n=11) had a higher risk to develop insulin-dependent diabetes up to the fifth decade, if compared with normal subjects (n=22). CONCLUSION: Complete loss of the human INS gene results in neonatal diabetes, while heterozygous INS deletion is a strong risk factor for developing insulin-dependent diabetes at adult age.

TI	Reduced appetite and body mass index with delayed puberty in a mother and son: association with a rare novel sequence variant in the leptin gene.
PG	521-7
AB	INTRODUCTION: Leptin deficiency caused by mutations within the leptin gene (LEP) results in severe early onset obesity, hypogonadism, pubertal delay and immune system abnormalities. Constitutional delay in growth and puberty (CDGP) is a common condition seen in paediatric clinics, in which children present with delayed growth and puberty but usually also have a slim body habitus. We hypothesized that LEP variants may play a role in the phenotype seen in CDGP. AIM: To screen a group of children with CDGP for pathogenic sequence variants in LEP. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Denaturing HPLC was used to screen for LEP sequence variants in DNA samples from 78 children with CDGP (predominantly white males) and 112 control subjects. DNA fragments with a WAVE pattern deviant from wild type were directly sequenced. A STAT3 luciferase reporter assay in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells transiently transfected with the leptin receptor was used to test activity of mutant leptin. RESULTS: One child with CDGP was identified to be heterozygous for a novel missense variant (c.68C&gt;G), which results in a proline to arginine substitution (p.P23R). This sequence variant was not identified in any of the other control subjects, but was identified in his mother who shared a similar phenotype of slim body habitus, reduced appetite and pubertal delay (menarche aged 15 years). The leptin variant showed similar stability in serum compared with wild type and did not demonstrate increased activity in an in vitro reporter gene assay. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a sequence variant within the LEP gene associated with reduced body mass index rather than obesity. We hypothesize that this variant has increased bioactivity in vivo.

TI	Distal gastric bypass surgery for the treatment of hypothalamic obesity after childhood craniopharyngioma.
PG	201-6
AB	CONTEXT: Obesity resulting from damage to the hypothalamus, i.e. hypothalamic obesity, is a severe condition that currently lacks any effective evidence-based therapy. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to describe the course of hypothalamic obesity in a craniopharyngioma patient treated with distal gastric bypass surgery and to outline distinct aspects of multidisciplinary case management. PATIENT AND METHODS: A 29-year-old man, who had undergone craniopharyngioma resection at the age of 8, was referred to our Interdisciplinary Obesity Centre with a body mass index (BMI) of 52.0 kg/m(2), type 2 diabetes and obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS). After careful preoperative preparation, including the adjustment of hormone substitution therapy for panhypopituitarism, nutritional counselling and a supervised exercise program, he underwent a distal gastric bypass operation. RESULTS: Eighteen months after the operation the patient's BMI had decreased to 31.9 kg/m(2), type 2 diabetes was in complete remission, and OSAS appeared to be improved. Also, feelings of hunger were markedly reduced after the operation. A standard regimen of supplements successfully prevented any severe nutritional deficiencies. After weight loss, the dose of hydrocortisone could be distinctly reduced without any signs of adrenal insufficiency while GH substitution had to be markedly increased to achieve normal IGF1 levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our case demonstrates that within a multidisciplinary team approach, a distal gastric bypass operation can be a safe and highly effective therapy for patients with hypothalamic obesity. Also, our findings hint at an effect of gastric bypass surgery on hunger and eating behaviour that may not essentially rely on hypothalamic mechanisms.

TI	Association of the +45T&gt;G and +276G&gt;T polymorphisms in the adiponectin gene with insulin resistance in nondiabetic Greek women.
PG	845-52
AB	OBJECTIVE: We explored potential associations of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ; +45T&gt;G, rs2241766 and +276G&gt;T, rs1501299) with circulating total and high-molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin, insulin resistance (IR), and markers of obesity in a healthy Greek female population. DESIGN AND METHODS: The two SNPs were genotyped in 349 women without diabetes (mean age: 47.0+/-12.1 years, mean body mass index: 28.9+/-5.6 kg/m(2)). Total and HMW adiponectin concentrations, body composition variables, IR parameters, and plasma lipid levels were determined. RESULTS: In single SNP analysis adjusting for several potential confounders, SNP +276G&gt;T was associated with higher fasting insulin levels (P=0.01) and higher homeostasis model assessment index for IR (HOMA-IR; P=0.009), and SNP +45T&gt;G was associated with lower insulin levels and HOMA-IR (P=0.05 and P=0.07 respectively). No association with total or HMW adiponectin, plasma lipid levels, and body composition variables was observed; however, haplotype analysis revealed that subjects homozygous for the most common +45T/+276G haplotype had lower total adiponectin levels than did noncarriers of this haplotype (P=0.02). The observed differences in HOMA-IR were very significant among women with a higher body fat (BF) percentage (&gt;or= the population median of 41%; all P&lt;or=0.005), but not among leaner individuals (P for interactions 0.01-0.07), thus suggesting that ADIPOQ effects on insulin sensitivity may depend upon BF status. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest a significant role of ADIPOQ variants at positions +45 and +276 in the development of IR in healthy Greek women possibly through an interaction with BF.

TI	Genetic variation in the ADIPOR2 gene is associated with liver fat content and its surrogate markers in three independent cohorts.
PG	593-602
AB	AIMS: We investigated whether polymorphisms in candidate genes involved in lipid metabolism and type 2 diabetes are related to liver fat content. METHODS: Liver fat content was measured using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) in 302 Finns, in whom single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4), adiponectin receptors 1 and 2 (ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2), and the three peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARA, PPARD, and PPARG) were analyzed. To validate our findings, SNPs significantly associated with liver fat content were studied in two independent cohorts and related to surrogate markers of liver fat content. RESULTS: In the Finnish subjects, polymorphisms in ACSL4 (rs7887981), ADIPOR2 (rs767870), and PPARG (rs3856806) were significantly associated with liver fat content measured with (1)H-MRS after adjusting for age, gender, and BMI. Anthropometric and circulating parameters were comparable between genotypes. In the first validation cohort of approximately 600 Swedish men, ACSL4 rs7887981 was related to fasting insulin and triglyceride concentrations, and ADIPOR2 rs767870 to serum gamma glutamyltransferase concentrations after adjusting for BMI. The SNP in PPARG (rs3856806) was not significantly associated with any relevant metabolic parameter in this cohort. In the second validation cohort of approximately 3000 subjects from Western Finland, ADIPOR2 rs767870, but not ACSL4 rs7887981 was related to fasting triglyceride concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variation, particularly in the ADIPOR2 gene, contributes to variation in hepatic fat accumulation in humans.

TI	The -G1245A IGF1 polymorphism is related with small head size and less brain sparing in small for gestational age born children.
PG	549-55
AB	CONTEXT: Small for gestational age (SGA) subjects experience pre	and postnatal growth restriction, which might be influenced by polymorphisms in the IGF1 gene. The well-known -841(CA)(n)/192 bp polymorphism has been associated with birth size, cardiovascular disease, and IGF-1 levels, and is in linkage disequilibrium with the -G1245A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs35767). OBJECTIVE: To associate the -G1245A SNP with head circumference (HC) and brain sparing (a greater head compared with height SDS) in short SGA and SGA catch-up subjects. DESIGN: Gene association study. PATIENTS: We studied 635 SGA subjects out of which 439 remained short and 196 had a postnatal height &gt;-2.00 SDS. MEASUREMENTS: The -G1245A SNP IGF1 gene polymorphism and head size. RESULTS: All SGA subjects had a postnatal head size below the population mean (-1.01 SDS, P&lt;0.001). Whereas SGA catch-up subjects had a head size that was in proportion with their height, short SGA subjects displayed extensive brain sparing (HC	height: SGA CU: 0.01 versus short SGA: 1.75 SDS, P&lt;0.001). The most severely SGA born subjects had a 0.4 SDS smaller postnatal head size and 0.6 SDS less brain sparing when carrying the -1245 A-allele in contrast to G-allele carriers (P=0.03). The association between the -G1245A SNP and head size remained significant after correction for birth weight and postnatal height SDS (P=0.03). Birth weight, birth length and postnatal height SDS were not related with the	G1245A SNP. CONCLUSIONS: The -1245 A-allele of the IGF1 promoter SNP is associated with a small head size and less brain sparing in SGA born subjects and particularly those with the lowest birth weight.

TI	Parental genomic imprinting in endocrinopathies.
PG	561-9
AB	Genomic imprinting is the phenomenon whereby some genes preferentially produce mRNA transcripts from the gene copy derived from the parent of a specific sex. It has been implicated in a number of human diseases (most of them of endocrine interest), such as Prader-Willi/Angelman syndromes, Silver-Russell syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, transient neonatal diabetes, the focal form of nesidioblastosis, and pseudohypoparathyroidism. Involvement of imprinted genes affecting birth weight and causing susceptibility to type 1 diabetes is under investigation. Recent knowledge about the varied molecular mechanisms involved will be outlined.

TI	Associations between RAS Gene polymorphisms, environmental factors and hypertension in Mongolian people.
PG	287-92
AB	OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between RAS system genes (AGT, ACE and AT(1)R) polymorphisms, environmental factors and hypertension in Mongolian people. METHODS: On the basis of cross-sectional study, a case-control study with 299 hypertensives and 281 nomotensives was conducted, and the conditions of environmental factors were acquired by questionnaire. Serum lipid and insulin were detected by using biochemical experiments. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms of RAS system were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism and polymerase chain reaction/single strand conformation polymorphism. RESULTS: Overweight or obesity, high serum TG and insulin resistance were risk factors of hypertension by single factor analysis. All the RAS genotype distributions were compatible with Hardy-Weinberg expectations. There were no significant differences to be found between cases and controls for genotype frequencies or allele frequencies of the six polymorphisms of RAS system, except in men group, OR value of men carried ACE ID+DD genotype vs. men carried II genotype was 2.20 (95%CI 1.21-4.02), and OR of people who carried both ACE ID (or DD) and AGT M235T MT (or MM) vs. people with both ACE ID (or DD) and AGT M235T TT was 1.59 (95%CI 1.06-2.38). CONCLUSIONS: Overweight or obesity, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance were risk factors of hypertension in Mongolian people. ACE gene ID+DD genotype was the risk factor of hypertension in men group. People who carried both ACE ID (or DD) and AGT M235T MT (or MM) had more risk to have hypertension.

TI	Thrombophilic gene mutations in cirrhotic patients with portal vein thrombosis.
PG	339-43
AB	OBJECTIVE: Thrombophilic gene mutations have been reported to be associated with the formation of portal vein thrombosis (PVT). This study aimed to investigate the role of thrombophilic gene mutations in cirrhotic patients with PVT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 74 cirrhotic patients (17 with PVT, 57 without PVT), and 19 non-cirrhotic patients with PVT and 80 healthy controls were included. Factor V Leiden G1691A, prothrombin G20210A and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T mutations were analysed by restriction fragment length polymorphism. RESULTS: Aetiologies and Child-Pugh distribution of cirrhotic patients with and without PVT were similar. Five of 17 (29%) of cirrhotic patients with PVT but only two of 57 (3.5%) of cirrhotics without PVT, five of 80 (6%) of controls and none of the 19 non-cirrhotic patients with PVT had factor V Leiden G1691A mutation (P&lt;0.05). Prothrombin G20210A mutation was found in five (29%) cirrhotic patients with PVT while only two (3.5%) cirrhotic patients without PVT, one (5%) non-cirrhotic patient with PVT and two (2.5%) controls had this mutation (P&lt;0.05). The frequency of the homozygote methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 677C-T mutation was similar in all four groups. CONCLUSIONS: Inherited thrombophilic gene mutations appear to increase the risk of PVT formation in cirrhotic patients but not in patients without liver disease in a cohort of Turkish patients.

TI	The plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 promoter 4G/4G genotype is not associated with ischemic stroke in a population of German children. Childhood Stroke Study Group.
PG	57-62
AB	OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between an insertion/deletion (4G/5G) polymorphism of the plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 gene and childhood patients with a past history of ischemic stroke. METHODS: The PAI-1 4G/4G genotype and the coinheritance with lipoprotein (Lp) (a) levels, the factor V (FV) G1691A mutation, the prothrombin (PT) G20210A variant, and the methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) T677T genotype were studied in 198 Caucasian children with stroke and 951 controls (same age, sex and ethnical distribution). In a randomly selected subgroup of patients/controls (n=60) PAI-I activities have been investigated. RESULTS: The distribution of the 4G/5G genotypes was no different in childhood stroke patients and controls, with a 4G allele frequency of 55.8% in patients compared with 53.8% in control subjects (P=0.49). The 4G/4G genotype compared with the remaining genotypes was present in 43 cases and 167 (17.6% vs. 21.7%; OR/CI: 1.30/0.89-1.98; P=0.3). PAI-1 activity was significantly elevated (P &lt; 0.001) in the patient group. CONCLUSIONS: Data presented here suggest that the 4G/4G genotype is not a major risk factor in the aetiology of childhood ischemic stroke.

TI	An atypical case of hypomethylation at multiple imprinted loci.
PG	360-2
AB	Angelman syndrome (AS) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) are caused by genetic and epigenetic mutations of the imprinted gene cluster on chromosome 15q13. Although the imprinting mutations causing PWS and AS are essentially opposite in nature, remarkably, a small number of patients have been reported with clinical features of PWS but epigenetic mutations consistent with AS. We report here a patient who presented with clinical features partially consistent with both PWS and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS). Epimutations were found at both the AS/PWS and BWS loci, and additionally at the H19, PEG3, NESPAS and GNAS loci. This patient is therefore the first described case with a primary epimutation consistent with AS accompanied by hypomethylation of other imprinted loci.

TI	A paternal deletion of MKRN3, MAGEL2 and NDN does not result in Prader-Willi syndrome.
PG	582-90
AB	The Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is caused by a 5-6 Mbp de novo deletion on the paternal chromosome 15, maternal uniparental disomy 15 or an imprinting defect. All three lesions lead to the lack of expression of imprinted genes that are active on the paternal chromosome only: MKRN3, MAGEL2, NDN, C15orf2, SNURF-SNRPN and more than 70 C/D box snoRNA genes (SNORDs). The contribution to PWS of any of these genes is unknown, because no single gene mutation has been described so far. We report on two patients with PWS who have an atypical deletion on the paternal chromosome that does not include MKRN3, MAGEL2 and NDN. In one of these patients, NDN has a normal DNA methylation pattern and is expressed. In another patient, the paternal alleles of these genes are deleted as the result of an unbalanced translocation 45,X,der(X)t(X;15)(q28;q11.2). This patient is obese and mentally retarded, but does not have PWS. We conclude that a deficiency of MKRN3, MAGEL2 and NDN is not sufficient to cause PWS.

TI	Preferential reciprocal transfer of paternal/maternal DLK1 alleles to obese children: first evidence of polar overdominance in humans.
PG	1126-34
AB	DLK1 is part of the Notch signalling pathway that controls various developmental processes. A functional role for DLK1 in adipogenesis is suggested by several animal models. Interestingly, the DLK1 gene is imprinted in eutherian mammals. To study whether variations in DLK1 affect body weight in humans, we analysed 32 polymorphisms in a 109 kb genomic region encompassing DLK1 on human chromosome 14. In a study sample of 1025 French and German trio families comprised of both parents and extremely obese offspring we found a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs1802710) associated with child and adolescent obesity. Analysis of the allelic transmission pattern indicated the existence of polar overdominance, an unusual mode of non-Mendelian inheritance in humans previously known from the callipyge mutation in sheep.

TI	Epimutation (hypomethylation) affecting the chromosome 14q32.2 imprinted region in a girl with upd(14)mat-like phenotype.
PG	1019-23
AB	Maternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 14 (upd(14)mat) causes clinically discernible features such as pre	and/or postnatal growth failure, hypotonia, obesity, small hands, and early onset of puberty. The monoallelic expression patterns at the 14q32.2 imprinted region are tightly related to methylation status of the DLK1-MEG3 intergenic differential methylation region (DMR) and the MEG3-DMR that are severely hypermethylated after paternal transmission and grossly hypomethylated after maternal transmission. We examined this imprinted region in a 2 2/12-year-old Japanese patient who was born with a normal birth size (length, +0.2 SD; weight, -0.5 SD) and showed postnatal growth failure (height, -3.1 SD; weight, -3.4 SD), hypotonia, frontal bossing, micrognathia, and small hands. Methylation analysis, genotyping analysis, and deletion analysis were performed with blood samples of the patient and the parents, showing that the DMRs of this patient were grossly hypomethylated in the absence of upd(14)mat and deletion of the DMRs. The results indicate the occurrence of an epimutation (hypomethylation) affecting the normally methylated DMRs of paternal origin, and imply that epimutations should be examined in patients with upd(14)mat-like phenotype.

TI	Clinical characterisation of the multiple maternal hypomethylation syndrome in siblings.
PG	453-61
AB	We present the first clinical report of sibs with the multiple maternal hypomethylation syndrome. Both sisters presented with transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM). By methylation-specific PCR of bisulphite-treated DNA, we found a mosaic spectrum of hypomethylation at the following maternally methylated loci in both sibs: ZAC (6q24), KCNQ1OT1 (11p15.5), GRB10 (7p11.2-12), PEG3 (19q13), PEG1/MEST (7q32), and NESPAS (20q13). While the older sister has a milder phenotype, the younger one was severely ill and died at 11 months of age. Despite phenotypic differences, the sisters had several manifestations of both TNDM and BWS in common. The family is highly consanguineous, and the parents are first cousins. We suggest that the genetic defect in this family is a novel, most likely autosomal recessive defect of methylation mechanisms, either in the sisters or in their mother, affecting her oocyte imprinting. The recurrence with affected sibs as reported in this family has implications for genetic counselling.

TI	No contribution of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene variants to severe obesity: a model for comprehensive case/control and quantitative cladistic analysis of ACE in human diseases.
PG	320-7
AB	Candidate gene analyses are often inconclusive owing to genetic or phenotypic heterogeneity, low statistical power, selection of nonfunctional SNPs, and inadequate statistical analysis of the genetic architecture. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is involved in adipocyte growth and function and the ACE-processed angiotensin II inhibits adipocyte differentiation. Associations between body mass index (BMI) and ACE polymorphisms have been reported in general populations, but the contribution to severe obesity of this gene, which is located under an obesity genome-scan linkage peak on 17q23, is unknown. ACE is one of the most studied genes and markers responsible for variation in circulating ACE enzyme levels have been extensively characterised. Eight of these variants were genotyped in 1054 severely obese cases and 918 nonobese controls, as well as 116 nuclear families from the genome scan (n=447), enabling the known clades to be inferred. Qualitative analysis of individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), haplotypes, clades, and diploclades demonstrated no significant associations (P&lt;0.05) after minimal correction for multiple testing. Quantitative analysis of clades and diploclades for BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, or ZBMI in children were also not significant. This rigorous, large-scale study of common, well-defined, severe polygenic obesity provides strong evidence that functionally relevant sequence variation in ACE, whether it is defined at the level of SNPs, haplotypes, or clades, is not associated with severe obesity in French Caucasians. Such a study design exemplifies the strategy needed to clearly define the contribution of the ACE gene to the plethora of complex genetic diseases where weak associations have been previously reported.

TI	Changing rates of genetic subtypes of Prader-Willi syndrome in the UK.
PG	127-30
AB	The genetically determined neurodevelopmental disorder, Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), has two main genetic subtypes: a 15q11-q13 deletion affecting the paternally inherited chromosome 15 and chromosome 15 maternal uniparental disomy (mUPD) in which two maternal copies of chromosome 15 are inherited but no paternal copy. It has been accepted that these subtypes occur in approximately 70 and 25% of cases, respectively. This is the first report of a greater proportion (50%) of those with PWS due to mUPD in children presently under 5 years living in the UK. Increasing maternal age at conception is likely to explain the changing proportions in this generation of mothers.

TI	VEGF C-634G polymorphism is associated with protection from isolated ventricular septal defect: case-control and TDT studies.
PG	1246-51
AB	The ventricular septal defect (VSD) is the most common congenital heart defect and no candidate susceptibility gene has been identified. Endocardial cushion and outflow septal morphogenesis, malalignment of which induces VSD, have been suggested to be mediated by the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Three single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants in promoter and 5'-UTR region of the VEGF gene, C-2578A (rs699947), G-1154A (rs1570360) and G-634C (rs2010963), were reported to alter its expression. We assessed the association in a Chinese population between these SNPs and VSD using a double approach: case-control and TDT designs. Among the three SNPs, only -634C allele was less frequently present in 222 patients compared to 352 controls (odds ratio: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.59-0.97, X(2)=5.06, P=0.024, not significant after a Bonferroni correction). This was significantly less transmitted to VSD patients (trios: 142) (odds ratio: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.25-0.62, X(2)=8.11, df=1, P=0.004, corrected P=0.024). A similar result was observed for haplotype -2578C/-1154G/-634C allele in both studies (in TDT: X(2)=7.51, df=1, P=0.006, corrected P=0.048). All these associations for the first time demonstrated that -634C allele was in a significant protective association against VSD, suggesting that VEGF dysregulation was involved in the pathological processes of VSD.

TI	Identification of cis	and trans-acting factors possibly modifying the risk of epimutations on chromosome 15.
PG	752-8
AB	In the majority of patients with a chromosome 15 imprinting defect (ID) causing Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) or Angelman syndrome (AS), the defect is a primary epimutation that occurred spontaneously in the absence of a DNA mutation. We have investigated whether common DNA sequence variants in the bipartite imprinting centre (IC) are associated with an increased susceptibility to imprinting defects. We have determined the haplotype structure of the IC and found that the two IC elements called 'PWS-SRO' and 'AS-SRO' lie on separate haplotype blocks. To identify susceptible IC sequence variants, we have used the transmission disequilibrium test. While we did not observe preferential transmission of a paternal allele or haplotype in 41 PWS-ID trios, we found a trend for preferential maternal transmission of one AS-SRO haplotype (H-AS3) in 48 AS-ID trios (P=0.058) and could identify two sequence variants in H-AS3 that are responsible for this effect. We also obtained tentative evidence that homozygosity for the 677C&gt;T variant of the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene on chromosome 1 might increase the risk of a maternal imprinting defect: the frequency of the TT genotype was significantly higher in the mothers of the AS patients with an imprinting defect than in the patients' fathers or the general population (P=0.028). Our findings suggest that women with the IC haplotype H-AS3 or homozygosity for the MTHFR 677C&gt;T variant may have an increased risk of conceiving a child with an imprinting defect, although the absolute risk is low.

TI	Replication of IGF2-INS-TH*5 haplotype effect on obesity in older men and study of related phenotypes.
PG	109-16
AB	Interindividual variation of the IGF2-INS-TH region influences risk of a variety of diseases and complex traits. Previous studies identified a haplotype (designated IGF2-INS-TH(*)5 and tagged by allele A of IGF2 ApaI, allele 9 of TH01 and class I alleles of INS VNTR) associated with low body mass index (BMI) in a cohort of UK men. We aimed here both to study whether previous findings relating (*)5 with weight are replicated in a different cohort of men (East Hertfordshire) characterised in more phenotypic detail and to test the effect of this haplotype on related subphenotypes. The PHASE program was used to identify (*)5 and not(*)5 haplotypes. A total of 490 haplotypes were derived from 131 men and 114 women, the frequency of (*)5 being around 9%. Specific tests of (*)5 haplotype (vs not(*)5 haplotypes) conducted included Student's t-test and multiple regression analyses. We observed replication of weight effect for the (*)5 haplotype in men: significant associations with lower BMI (-1.81 kg/m(2), P=0.009), lower waist circumference (-6.3 cm, P=0.001) and lower waist-hip ratio (-5%, P&lt;0.001). This haplotype also marks nearly two-fold lower 120 min insulin (P=0.004) as well as low baseline insulin (-11.02 pmol/l, P=0.043) and low 30 min insulin (-64.44 pmol/l, P=0.072) in a glucose tolerance test. No association between (*)5 and these traits was found in women. Our results, taken together with other data on IGFII levels and TH activity, point to the importance of (*)5 as an integrated polygenic haplotype relevant to obesity and insulin response to glucose in men.

TI	Mosaic imprinting defect in a patient with an almost typical expression of the Prader-Willi syndrome.
PG	273-7
AB	We describe a young woman with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) due to a mosaic imprinting defect. Three independent assays revealed a reduced proportion of nonmethylated SNURF-SNRPN alleles in peripheral blood DNA: methylation-specific PCR followed by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (MSP/DHPLC), methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme analysis and methylation-specific real-time PCR analysis. Microsatellite analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridisation revealed apparently normal chromosomes 15 of biparental origin. Based on the MSP/DHPLC and real-time PCR results, we estimate that approximately 50% of the patient's blood cells have an imprinting defect and 50% of the cells are normal. Apart from a rather normal facial appearance, the proband has typical features of PWS.

TI	Mutation analysis of the WFS1 gene in seven Danish Wolfram syndrome families; four new mutations identified.
PG	1275-84
AB	Wolfram syndrome (WS) is a neuro-degenerative autosomal recessive (AR) disorder (OMIM #222300) caused by mutations in the WFS1 gene on 4p16.1. More than 120 mutations have been identified in WFS1 associated with AR WS, as well as autosomal dominant nonsyndromic low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss (LFSNHL). WFS1 variants were identified in eight subjects from seven families with WS, leading to the identification of four novel mutations, Q194X (nonsense), H313Y (missense), L313fsX360 (duplication frame shift) and F883fsX951 (deletion frame shift), and four previously reported mutations, A133T and L543R (missense), V415del (in frame triple deletion) and F883fsX950 (deletion frame shift). A mutation was found in 11/14 disease chromosomes, two subjects were homozygous for one mutation, one subject was compound heterozygous for two nucleotide substitutions (missense), one subject was compound heterozygous for a duplication and a deletion (frame shift), and in three families only one mutation was detected (Q194X and H313Y). All affected individuals shared clinically early-onset diabetes mellitus and progressive optic atrophy with onset in the first and second decades, respectively. In contrast, diabetes insipidus was present in two subjects only. Various degrees and types of hearing impairment were diagnosed in six individuals and cataract was observed in five subjects.

TI	Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) in a Dutch family: evidence for a TNFRSF1A mutation with reduced penetrance.
PG	63-6
AB	Mutations of the tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFRSF1A) gene underly susceptibility to a subset of autosomal dominant recurrent fevers (ADRFs). We report on a two-generation six-member Dutch family in which a novel R92P mutation and reduced plasma TNFRSF1A levels were found in all the children, including two who are unaffected. However, only the daughter proband and father exhibited a typical TNF-receptor associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) phenotype. PCR-RFLP analysis revealed that the mutation was not present in 120 control chromosomes from unaffected Dutch individuals. As this R92P mutation is present in two unaffected carriers it appears to be less penetrant than previously reported TNFRSF1A mutations involving cysteine residues in the extracellular domains.

TI	A previously unrecognised phenotype characterised by obesity, muscular hypotonia, and ability to speak in patients with Angelman syndrome caused by an imprinting defect.
PG	638-44
AB	The clinical features of Angelman syndrome (AS) comprise severe mental retardation, postnatal microcephaly, macrostomia and prognathia, absence of speech, ataxia, and a happy disposition. We report on seven patients who lack most of these features, but presented with obesity, muscular hypotonia and mild mental retardation. Based on the latter findings, the patients were initially suspected of having Prader-Willi syndrome. DNA methylation analysis of SNRPN and D15S63, however, revealed an AS pattern, ie the maternal band was faint or absent. Cytogenetic studies and microsatellite analysis demonstrated apparently normal chromosomes 15 of biparental inheritance. We conclude that these patients have an imprinting defect and a previously unrecognised form of AS. The mild phenotype may be explained by an incomplete imprinting defect or by cellular mosaicism.

TI	Transient neonatal diabetes mellitus in a child with invdup(6)(q22q23) of paternal origin.
PG	417-9
AB	An association between the rare condition of transient neonatal diabetes mellitus and either uniparental disomy for chromosome 6 or dup(6)(q22q23) raised the assumption that in this location on chromosome 6 there is an imprinted gene. We diagnosed diabetes that developed in a baby girl immediately after birth and resolved after 7 weeks of insulin treatment. Due to some minor dysmorphic features, we investigated her karyotype and identified invdup(6)(q22q23). The duplication spans at least 10 cM including the DNA sites DS270,S314,S1684 and S310. This case further supports the assumption that an imprinted gene exists on chromosome 6q22-23.

TI	CTLA-4 49 A/G dimorphism and type 1 diabetes susceptibility: a French case-control study and segregation analysis. Evidence of a maternal effect.
PG	251-7
AB	Several studies have demonstrated an association of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated molecule 4 (CTLA-4) (IDDM 12) alanine 17 with type 1 diabetes, but we wished to study the parental effect of CTLA-4 49 A/G dimorphism in diabetic families. The CTLA-4 exon 1 polymorphism (49 A/G), HLA-DRB1 and insulin gene (INS) variable number tandem repeats (VNTR) were analysed in 134 type 1 diabetic patients vs. 273 control subjects. The segregation analysis for transmission was carried out in 70 informative diabetic families using the transmission distortion test (TDT). All genotyping was performed by PCR-RFLP. CTLA-4 49 G allele frequency was not increased in diabetic patients compared to controls (41 vs. 38%, not significant). The distribution of GG, AG and AA CTLA-4 genotypes was similar in the two groups (13, 57 and 30% vs. 11, 54 and 35%, respectively) and was independent of HLA-DRB1 or INS VNTR polymorphism. The CTLA-4 49 G allele showed weak distorted transmission to the diabetic offspring, whereas random transmission was observed in unaffected offspring. This distortion is attributable to a maternal effect (71% compared to the 50% expected ratio; tdt = 4.8; P &lt; 0.03). The combined transmission of maternal CTLA-4 G with HLA-DRB1*03 (90%; tdt = 6.4; P &lt; 0.01) and VNTR class I (80%; tdt = 5.4; P &lt; 0.02) enhanced the susceptibility effect of each marker separately. We noted a slight CTLA-4 49 G and HLA-DRB1*04 distortion of transmission shared in paternal and maternal diabetic meiosis. In non-diabetic offspring, the CTLA-4 49 A allele confers a protective effect in the presence of maternal HLA-DRB1*03 and paternal HLA-DRB1*04 alleles. Despite the absence of a positive association of the CTLA-4 49 G allele with type 1 diabetes, our segregation analysis supports the hypothesis of a modulation by CTLA-4 49 G/A dimorphism of the susceptibility conferred by maternal HLA-DRB1*03 inheritance. This potential parental effect needs to be confirmed in a larger data set.

TI	Association of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and class II major histocompatibility complex alleles with the secretion of TNF-alpha and TNF-beta by human mononuclear cells: a possible link to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
PG	224-31
AB	We have investigated the correlation between different tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and class II major histocompatibility complex alleles in the lipopolysaccharide	or phytohemagglutinin-induced secretion of TNF-alpha and TNF-beta by human monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells in 87 unrelated Danish male individuals. Significant differences in TNF-alpha secretory capacity between TNF NcoI restriction fragment length polymorphisms, TNFa and TNFc microsatellite alleles and DR alleles were identified. No correlation with TNF-beta secretory capacity was found for any of the markers studied. TNF genotyping allowed us to define four extended HLA haplotypes which correlate with TNF-alpha secretory capacity. Two of these are DR4 positive: DQw8, DR4, TNFB*1, TNFa6, B44, A2 and DQw8, DR4, TNFB*2, TNFa2, B15, A2. Individuals carrying the TNFB*2, TNFa2 haplotype had a higher TNF-alpha secretory capacity than those carrying the TNFB*1, TNFa6 haplotype. In a group of DR3/DR4 heterozygous patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), the frequency of the TNFa2 allele was higher than in HLA-DR matched controls, whereas the TNFa6 allele was more frequent in control individuals. In the DR3/DR4 heterozygous diabetic group 12/26 had the alleles combination DQw8, DR4 (Dw4), C4A3, TNFB*2, TNFa2, B15, whereas only 1/18 controls had this haplotype. This diabetogenic haplotype is identical to the DR4 haplotype which correlates with a higher TNF-alpha response. These observations suggest a direct role for the TNF locus in the pathogenesis of IDDM.

TI	Single nucleotide polymorphisms in inflammation-related genes are associated with venous thromboembolism.
PG	289-92
AB	BACKGROUND: Various genetic risk factors are known to increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Increasing evidence suggests a &quot;cross-talk&quot; between the coagulation and inflammatory cascade. Therefore, polymorphisms in genes involved in inflammation may influence susceptibility towards VTE. The aim of the study was to investigate the role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in inflammation genes for susceptibility towards VTE. METHODS: The study group consisted of 108 (47 men and 61 women) Dutch patients with documented VTE and 325 healthy controls from the same geographical area (117 men and 208 women). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for VTE separately and if indicated by gender were calculated to assess whether genotype and allele frequency were associated with thrombosis. RESULTS: Heterozygosity for SNP -899C/T of the interleukin 1-alpha gene (IL1A -899C/T) was under-represented in VTE patients compared to the control group (OR=0.51, 95% CI 0.32-0.82). The IL6 -174 CC genotype was more frequent in male patients with VTE compared to male controls (OR=4.06, 95% CI 1.43-11.5). Female patients carried significantly more IL13 (intron3) TT genotype (OR=5.60, 95% CI 1.94-18.5) compared to female controls. The allelic frequency of IL4 -589 T allele was significantly increased in female patients (OR=1.72, 95% CI 1.05-2.81) in contrast to men where no differences were observed. CONCLUSION: Four SNPs in inflammatory-related genes of IL1A, IL4, IL6, and IL13 may be associated with VTE. These results need to be confirmed in independent groups with larger number of patients.

TI	Terminal 6.9 Mb deletion of chromosome 15q, associated with a structurally abnormal X chromosome in a patient with congenital diaphragmatic hernia and heart defect.
PG	186-8
AB	We report the case of a female patient exhibiting multiple congenital malformations including diaphragmatic hernia and heart defect. Cytogenetic studies (including karyotype, FISH and array-CGH) showed a de novo terminal deletion (6.9 Mb) on chromosome 15 in association with a recombinant X chromosome bearing a 9-Mb Xp duplication and a 46-Mb Xq deletion distal to XIST. The recombinant X chromosome was caused by a maternal inv(X)(p22.31q22.3). The X chromosome inactivation pattern was skewed in the patient suggesting a possible inactivation of the recombinant X chromosome. Considering these results, the phenotype was linked to the de novo terminal 15q deletion. These results strengthen the assumption that array-CGH should be applied to each fetus/newborn with multiple congenital malformations.

TI	Large de novo deletion of 7p15.1 to 7p12.1 involving the imprinted gene GRB10 associated with a complex phenotype including features of Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome.
PG	89-93
AB	We present an infant with a de novo cytogenetically visible interstitial deletion of approximately 21.9Mb involving chromosome bands 7p15.1-7p12.1, with the loss of 119 genes confirmed by array CGH. The infant had a ventricular septal defect, hand and skull anomalies, and hyperglycaemia compatible with haploinsufficiency of TBX20, GLI3, and GCK genes, respectively. In addition, the infant had some features reminiscent of Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome including macroglossia, umbilical hernia, and a relatively large birth weight and we speculate that this is due to the deletion of GRB10, an imprinted gene on chromosome 7. This report illustrates how knowledge of genes within a deleted interval facilitates optimal medical management, can explain observed phenotypes, and stimulates research questions.

TI	Monozygotic twins discordant for vascular malformations and dysregulated growth.
PG	14-8
AB	There is a large group of disorders characterized by non-cranial vascular malformations and a dysregulated growth, of which the prototype may be Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS). The aetiology of KTS and vascular malformations-dysregulated growth (VM-DG) syndromes resembling KTS is obscure, but polygenic paradominant inheritance involving mutations or polymorphisms in two or more genes simultaneously, of which one (or more) are involved in (lymph)angiogenesis and the other(s) in growth regulation has been proposed for KTS and related VM-DG entities. This provides an explanation for the variability of the VM-DG syndromes through the numerous possible combinations of mutated genes involved. We report on three monozygotic female twins who are discordant for a VM-DG syndrome resembling KTS. We suggest that our observation is consistent with the concept of polygenic paradominant inheritance involving two or more genes. We discuss the published observations in twins discordant for other disorders associated with disturbed growth regulation such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and Silver-Russell syndrome, and the occurrence in cousins with KTS and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, which are best explained by an imprinting disturbance. We propose that, similarly, disturbed imprinting plays a role in the pathogenesis of VM-DG syndromes in general, and suggest the same may hold for KTS in sensu strictu or Proteus syndrome. Further studies to investigate imprinting status in VM-DG syndromes, including KTS and Proteus syndrome, are warranted.

TI	The changing phenotype in diploid/triploid mosaicism may mimic genetic syndromes with aberrant genomic imprinting: follow up in a 14-year-old girl.
PG	573-9
AB	Diploid/triploid mosaicism is a rare chromosome aberration characterized by growth and mental retardation, muscular hypotonia, clinodactyly, syndactyly of fingers and toes, asymmetry of the body and the face, truncal obesity, and pigmentary anomalies of the skin. Many patients initially present with severe growth retardation and develop truncal obesity later in life. Variable phenotype expression during development and restriction of triploid cells to certain tissues explain why the diagnosis of diploid/triploid mosaicism is often delayed. Here, we report on a moderately retarded 14-year-old girl with diploid/triploid mosaicism due to inclusion of the second polar body, whose changing phenotype overlaps considerably with different genetic disorders associated with aberrant genomic imprinting. The observation that triploid cells, which in our patient show remarkably variable distribution in different tissues, may also be present in easily accessible tissues such as urinary sediment or buccal smear may contribute to an earlier diagnosis of this rare syndrome.

TI	Imprinting center analysis in Prader-Willi and Angelman syndrome patients with typical and atypical phenotypes.
PG	11-20
AB	Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) are genetic disorders caused by a deficiency of imprinted gene expression from the paternal or maternal chromosome 15, respectively. This deficiency is due to the deletion of the 15q11-q13 region, parental uniparental disomy of the chromosome 15, or imprinting defect (ID). Mutation of the UBE3A gene causes approximately 10% of AS cases. In this present study, we describe the molecular analysis and phenotypes of two PWS patients and four AS patients with ID. One of the PWS patients has a non-familial imprinting center (IC) deletion and displayed a severe phenotype with an atypical PWS appearance, hyperactivity and psychiatric vulnerability. The other PWS and AS patients did not present genetic abnormalities in the IC, suggesting an epimutation as the genetic cause. The methylation pattern of two AS patients showed a faint maternal band corresponding to a mosaic ID. One of these mosaic patients displayed a mild AS phenotype while the other displayed a PWS-like phenotype.

TI	ADIPOQ gene polymorphism rs1501299 interacts with fibre intake to affect adiponectin concentration in children: the GENe-Diet Attica Investigation on childhood obesity.
PG	493-7
AB	BACKGROUND: Adiponectin, an adipose-derived hormone with central and peripheral actions, is involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis. Interactions between genetic and environmental factors have been associated with decrease in circulating adiponectin leading to obesity. AIM: We investigated whether variants of the ADIPOQ gene encoding adiponectin interact with diet to predict serum adiponectin concentration. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of healthy school-aged children of Greek origin (n = 991), aged 11.2 +/	0.6 years was conducted in 2005-2006. DNA was genotyped for two SNPs [rs1501299 (n = 741) and rs17300539 (n = 713)] located in the ADIPOQ gene. Detailed dietary, behavioural, lifestyle, anthropometric and biochemical data were recorded for all participants. RESULTS: Both SNPs were in HWE. The rs1501299 (GG vs GT + TT) x fibre interaction was significantly associated with adiponectin concentration (P = 0.028). When fibre intake was low, GG homozygotes exhibited significantly higher adiponectin concentrations compared to T allele carriers (mean +/	SD = 5.1 +/	2.7 vs 4.2 +/	2.3; P = 0.020). CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, the rs1501299 x fibre interaction was significantly associated with adiponectin levels; in specific, GG homozygotes exhibited higher adiponectin levels compared to T carriers under conditions of lower fibre intake.

TI	DNA hypomethylation, transient neonatal diabetes, and prune belly sequence in one of two identical twins.
PG	207-13
AB	One known genetic mechanism for transient neonatal diabetes is loss of methylation at 6q24. The etiology of prune belly sequence is unknown but a genetic defect, affecting the mesoderm from which the triad abdominal muscle hypoplasia, urinary tract abnormalities, and cryptorchidism develop, has been suggested. We investigated a family, including one twin, with transient neonatal diabetes and prune belly sequence. Autoantibody tests excluded type 1 diabetes. Microsatellite marker analysis confirmed the twins being monozygotic. We identified no mutations in ZFP57, KCNJ11, ABCC8, GCK, HNF1A, HNF1B, HNF3B, IPF1, PAX4, or ZIC3. The proband had loss of methylation at the 6q24 locus TNDM and also at the loci IGF2R, DIRAS3, and PEG1, while the other family members, including the healthy monozygotic twin, had normal findings. The loss of methylation on chromosome 6q24 and elsewhere may indicate a generalized maternal hypomethylation syndrome, which accounts for both transient neonatal diabetes and prune belly sequence.

TI	Epigenetic changes in the hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin gene: a mechanism linking maternal undernutrition to obesity in the offspring?
PG	194-201
AB	Maternal undernutrition is associated with programming of obesity in offspring. While previous evidence has linked programming to the hypothalamic, pituitary, and adrenal (HPA) axis it could also affect the hypothalamic neuropeptides which regulate food intake and energy balance. Alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone (alphaMSH), a key regulator of these neuronal pathways, is derived from pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) which is therefore a prime target for the programming of obesity. Several models of maternal undernutrition have identified changes in POMC in hypothalami from foetuses or offspring at various ages. These models have also shown that the offspring go on to develop obesity and/or glucose intolerance. It is our hypothesis that programming leads to epigenetic changes in hypothalamic neuropeptide genes. Therefore when there is subsequent increased food availability, the epigenetic changes could cause dysfunctional transcriptional regulation of energy balance. We present evidence of epigenetic changes in the POMC gene promoter in foetal hypothalami after peri-conceptional undernutrition. In this model there are also epigenetic changes in the hypothalamic glucocorticoid receptor with consequent up-regulation of the receptor which could lead to alterations in the regulation of POMC and neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the hypothalamus. Thus maternal undernutrition could cause epigenetic changes in the POMC and glucocorticoid receptor genes, in the foetal hypothalamus, which may predispose the offspring to altered regulation of food intake, energy expenditure and glucose homeostasis, later in life.

TI	A novel approach to syncopal patients: association analysis of polymorphisms in G-protein genes and tilt outcome.
PG	89-93
AB	AIMS: G-proteins signal transduction pathways play a basic role in cardiovascular reflexes. We hypothesized that the predisposition to reflex-mediated syncope may be associated with genetic variations in G-protein genes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of three single-nucleotide polymorphisms in G-protein genes on tilting outcome in syncopal patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 217 syncopal patients free from any other disease were genotyped and examined related to tilting results. Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism in gene encoding the Gs-protein alpha-subunit (polymorphism C393T), the G-protein beta 3 subunit--GNB3 (polymorphism C825T)--and for the cardiac regulator of G-protein signalling RGS2 (polymorphism C1114G). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the homozygotes 825TT GNB3 (OR 0.37; 95% CI 0.14-0.97; P &lt; 0.05) and body mass index (OR 0.87; 95% CI 0.78-0.97; P = 0.005) were independently associated with a lower chance of positive tilting results. No relationship was found between Vasovagal Syncope International Study type of syncope and the studied genotypes or the carriage of the polymorphic alleles. CONCLUSIONS: An association between tilting results and C825T GNB3 polymorphism in syncopal patients was found. The syncopal homozygotes 825TT GNB3 had a significantly lower chance of syncope during tilt testing.

TI	Novel P2 promoter-derived HNF4alpha isoforms with different N-terminus generated by alternate exon insertion.
PG	1200-11
AB	Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha) is a critical transcription factor for pancreas and liver development and functions in islet beta cells to maintain glucose homeostasis. Mutations in the human HNF4A gene lead to maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY1) and polymorphisms are associated with increased risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Expression of six HNF4alpha variants, three each from two developmentally regulated promoters, has been firmly established. We have now detected a new set of HNF4alpha variants designated HNF4alpha10-12 expressed from distal promoter P2. These variants, generated by inclusion of previously undetected exon 1E (human=222 nt, rodent=136 nt) following exon 1D have an altered N-terminus but identical remaining reading frame. HNF4alpha10-alpha12 are expressed in pancreatic islets (and liver) and exhibit transactivation potentials similar to the corresponding alpha7-alpha9 isoforms. DNA-binding analyses implied much higher protein levels of HNF4alpha10-alpha12 in liver than expected from the RT-PCR data. Our results provide evidence for a more complex expression pattern of HNF4alpha than previously appreciated. We recommend inclusion of exon 1E and nearby DNA sequences in screening for HNF4alpha mutations and polymorphisms in genetic analyses of MODY1 and T2DM.

TI	Genetic variation in the G-50T polymorphism of the cytochrome P450 epoxygenase CYP2J2 gene and the risk of younger onset type 2 diabetes among Chinese population: potential interaction with body mass index and family history.
PG	346-52
AB	BACKGROUND: Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2J2 is a regulatory enzyme in the biosynthesis of biologically active CIS-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs). EETs have been suggested to modulate PPAR-gamma and PPAR-alpha transcription activity and play a role in stimulus-secretion coupling in pancreatic beta cells. Genetic abnormalities in the expression of CYP2J enzymes may play a role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Our objective was to investigate CYP2J2 G-50T polymorphism (rs890293) in association with insulin resistance markers and T2DM in a Chinese population. METHODS: A total of 1 747 Chinese T2DM patients and 994 non-diabetic subjects were studied. The CYP2J2 G-50T polymorphism was determined by a restriction fragment-length polymorphism polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Neither the CYP2J2 genotype distribution nor allele frequency differed between the control subjects and the T2DM patients. However, among diabetics, subjects with a younger age at diagnosis (AAD; &lt;40 years) had significantly higher T variant frequency than those with an AAD&gt;/=40 years. When diabetic patients were stratified by their AAD in 10-year intervals, the trend was significantly linear among age grades. A significant interaction between the CYP2J2 T variant and younger onset diabetic subjects with positive family diabetes history, and BMI&gt;/=27 kg/m (2) were observed to have the highest risk of diabetes and younger onset diabetics with the T variant had higher homeostasis model assessment estimate of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and HOMA-beta values than their GG genotype counterparts. Plasma concentrations of stable EET metabolites were significantly lower in individuals with the G-50T SNP in younger onset diabetics. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that age of onset, family history, and obesity may modify the association between the CYP2J2 G-50T polymorphism and T2DM risk. CYP2J2 G-50T polymorphism may contribute to the pathogenesis of T2DM, partially by effects on insulin resistance, in patients with younger onset T2DM.

TI	No evidence for involvement of alleles of the 825-C/T polymorphism of the G-protein subunit beta 3 in body weight regulation.
PG	402-5
AB	The 825-C/T polymorphism of the beta 3 subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein gene (GNB3) has been shown to be associated with essential hypertension in humans. Recently, it was also reported that the 825-T allele has a higher frequency in obese than non-obese hypertensives suggesting that the primary effect of this allele is on body weight. The association to hypertension might merely be a secondary effect of the higher weight of the respective allele carriers. To investigate an involvement of the 825-T allele in body weight regulation in young individuals, we evaluated allele frequencies in 440 extremely obese children and adolescents (82.9% had a body mass index [BMI] &gt; or = 99th percentile), 51 obese students (BMI &gt; or = 90th percentile), 110 normal weight students (BMI between 40th and 60th percentile) and 144 underweight students (BMI &lt; or = 15th percentile). The study groups were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction with subsequent restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (PCR-RFLP). The one-sided Yates-corrected chi(2)-test and the Cochran-Armitage trend test for association were performed. Tests for association were negative. The 825-T allele frequencies were similar in the four study groups belonging to different weight ranges (extreme early onset obesity: 0.29; obesity: 0.28; normal weight: 0.35; underweight: 0.32). Similarly, genotype frequencies did not differ between the groups. We concluded that the 825-T allele of the GNB3 does not play a major role in weight regulation in German children, adolescents and young adults.

TI	The molecular basis and clinical characteristics of Maternally Inherited Diabetes and Deafness (MIDD), a recently recognized diabetic subtype.
PG	205-11
AB	Diabetes mellitus comprises a number of diseases with hyperglycemia as hallmark. Currently, multiple genetic factors are being recognized which contribute to the development of diabetes or which may modulate its clinical expression. This review presents an overview of our current knowledge on a diabetic subtype which associates with a single mutation in mitochondrial DNA. Based on the triad of Maternal Inheritance, Diabetes and Deafness we propose the name Maternally Inherited Diabetes and Deafness (MIDD) for this syndrome. In Northwestern Europe MIDD affects approximately 1.3% of all diabetic individuals.

TI	Possible roles of zinc nutriture in the fetal origins of disease.
PG	378-81
AB	Risk of diseases of metabolism such as atherosclerosis and adult onset diabetes mellitus is increased by fetal malnutrition. Deficiencies of micronutrients essential for methylation are believed to contribute to the phenomenon in part through epigenetic abnormalities. Zinc is one of the nutrients essential for the epigenome. Because the worldwide prevalence of zinc deficiency is at least 20%, fetal zinc deficiency is common. We suggest fetal zinc deficiency contributes to the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases in adults. In support of our thesis, research in experimental models and humans established the essentiality of zinc at all stages of intrauterine and infant life. Experiments in rodents and/or non-human primates found that fetal and/or suckling zinc deficiency impairs neuropsychological functions of progeny and that the effects persist in spite of nutritional rehabilitation. In addition, maternal zinc deficiency in mice is reported to impair immunity of progeny; effects persist in spite of nutritional rehabilitation into the next generation. We suspect that zinc deficiency is a far greater human health problem than is generally recognized.

TI	Prevalence of genetic thrombophilic polymorphisms in the Sri Lankan population--implications for association study design and clinical genetic testing services.
PG	159-62
AB	We investigated the prevalence of genotypes/alleles of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and haplotypes defined by them in three genes in which variations are associated with venous thromboembolism in 80 Sinhalese, 80 Sri Lankan Tamils and 80 Moors in the Sri Lankan population and compared the SNP data with that of other populations in Southern India and haplotype data with that of HapMap populations. The genes and polymorphisms investigated were Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR)	677C&gt;T (rs1801133), 1298A&gt;C (rs1801131), 1317T&gt;C, 1793G&gt;A (rs2274976); Factor V (F5)	1691G&gt;A (rs6025) and 4070A&gt;G (rs1800595); and prothrombin (F2)	20210G&gt;A (rs1799963). The polymorphisms were genotyped using PCR/RFLP methods. The prevalence of the variant alleles of each polymorphism in the Sinhalese, Tamils, and Moors was MTHFR 677T: Sinhalese	13%, Tamils	9%, Moors	9%. 1317T&gt;C: Sinhalese	0%; Tamils	0%; Moors	0%. 1793A: Sinhalese	19%, Tamils	19%, Moors	19%. F5 1691A: Sinhalese	2%, Tamils	3%, Moors	2%. 4070G: Sinhalese	6%, Tamils	5%, Moors	8%. F2 20210A: Sinhalese	0%, Tamils	0%, Moors	0%. The frequencies observed were similar to data from other South Indian populations; the haplotype data showed haplotypes unique to the Sri Lankan population when compared to HapMap populations. rs9651118 was identified as a SNP that splits the haplotypes harbouring the functionally significant 677T allele in the MTHFR gene. This data would be useful in planning genetic association studies in the Sri Lankan population and in deciding on which genetic variants should be tested in a clinical genetic testing service.

TI	Thrombotic complications during cancer treatment in children.
PG	231-35
AB	AIM: To determine the hereditary risk factors contributing to the development of thrombosis in children with cancer. METHODS: Sensitive PCR	restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. RESULTS: There has been shown significant prevalence of factor V leiden (FVL) in the group of 19 patients with thrombosis (P=0.0004). The prothrombin G20210A mutation was not detected in 19 cases and 80 controls, indicating low frequency of this mutation among Belarusian population. The MTHFR C677T mutation was found in both cases and controls and has approximately the same frequencies in both groups (47.4% and 55.0% accordingly). CONCLUSION: Clinical condition, coagulation status, volume of haemostatic therapy and clinical evidence of sepsis, as well as duration of catheterization were not significant as predisposing to thrombosis factors. We have shown that the leading risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in children with cancer are mutation FVL, prolonged immobilization or both immobilization and indwelling femoral venous catheter. Cancer patients affected with VTE during treatment are potential candidates for genotyping assay for FVL mutation, as the former may determine duration of anticoagulation therapy and administration of secondary prophylaxis.

TI	Gene therapy for proliferative ocular diseases.
PG	1053-8
AB	Proliferative ocular diseases encompass a wide variety of pathological processes with adverse cellular differentiation, proliferation and migration as common features. Pathologies may involve neovascular responses associated with diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity or age-related macular degeneration. These diseases are quite prevalent and account for substantial visual impairment and blindness worldwide. Although treatment strategies are largely surgical, advances in our understanding of the proteins crucial to cell transdifferentiation, proliferation and migration, along with better gene transfer techniques, have greatly increased the potential for biological treatment options. In this report, the most common proliferative ocular vascular diseases and existing therapeutic modalities will be reviewed and an overview of possible gene therapy options will be discussed, along with potential candidate genes.

TI	Replication of association of a novel insulin receptor gene polymorphism with polycystic ovary syndrome.
PG	1736-41.e1-11
AB	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate association with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) of 295 variants in 39 genes central to metabolic insulin signaling and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) regulation, followed by replication efforts. DESIGN: Case-control association study, with discovery and replication cohorts. SETTING: Subjects were recruited from reproductive endocrinology clinics, and controls were recruited from communities surrounding the University of Alabama at Birmingham and Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam. PATIENT(S): A total of 273 cases with PCOS and 173 control subjects in the discovery cohort; and 526 cases and 3,585 control subjects in the replication cohort. All subjects were caucasian. INTERVENTION(S): Phenotypic and genotypic assessment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Detection of 295 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), PCOS status. RESULT(S): Several SNPs were associated with PCOS in the discovery cohort. Four insulin receptor (INSR) SNPs and three insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) SNPs associated with PCOS were genotyped in the replication cohort. One INSR SNP (rs2252673) replicated association with PCOS. The minor allele conferred increased odds of PCOS in both cohorts, independent of body mass index. CONCLUSION(S): A pathway-based tagging SNP approach allowed us to identify novel INSR SNPs associated with PCOS, one of which confirmed association in a large replication cohort.

TI	Growth and development of children born after in vitro fertilization.
PG	1662-73
AB	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate growth and development of children born after IVF treatment. DESIGN: Literature review. CONCLUSION(S): At present there is substantial evidence that children born after IVF are at increased risk for adverse perinatal outcome, congenital malformations, and rare epigenetic defects. It is still unclear whether observed health problems originate from the IVF procedure itself or the underlying subfertility problems of the parents. Current follow-up studies regarding postnatal growth and morbidity rates are scarce with conflicting results and other areas of long-term research in children born after IVF are still in its infancy. The importance of the worldwide continuing monitoring of children born after IVF to investigate potential long-term consequences including the development of cardiovascular diseases is therefore highlighted.

TI	Kabuki syndrome in a girl with mosaic 45,X/47,XXX and aortic coarctation.
PG	1826.e5-7
AB	OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical findings of a patient with mosaic 45,X/47,XXX and aortic coarctation. DESIGN: Descriptive case study. SETTING: Tertiary medical center. PATIENT(S): A 6-year-old girl with stigmata of Turner syndrome, aortic coarctation, patent ductus arteriosus, and a peculiar facial appearance. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Cytogenetic analysis. RESULT(S): The patient manifested a characteristic Kabuki syndrome facial appearance with long palpebral fissures, everted lateral third of lower eyelids, arched eyebrows, a depressed nasal tip, large dysplastic ears and epicanthic folds. She had undergone cardiac surgery for treatment of aortic coarctation and patent ductus arteriosus. Cytogenetic analysis of the blood lymphocytes revealed a karyotype of mos 45,X,9ph [35 cells]/47,XXX,9ph [5 cells]. CONCLUSION(S): This is the first report of mosaic 45,X/47,XXX associated with Kabuki syndrome. We emphasize that Kabuki syndrome, a peculiar facial appearance and aortic coarctation, should be considered in girls with sex chromosome abnormalities.

TI	Genetic variants in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma influence insulin resistance and testosterone levels in normal women, but not those with polycystic ovary syndrome.
PG	862-9
AB	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) Pro12Ala and silent exon 6 (His447His) polymorphisms with the clinical features of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). DESIGN: Patients with PCOS and control subjects were genotyped for Pro12Ala and His447His. Associations between genotype, diagnosis, and hormonal/metabolic parameters were assessed. SETTING: Subjects were recruited from the reproductive endocrinology clinic at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama. Control subjects were recruited from the surrounding community. Genotyping was performed at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. PATIENT(S): Participants included 285 white women with PCOS and 187 controls. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The Pro12Ala and His447His genotypes, and hormonal and metabolic phenotypes. RESULT(S): The Pro12Ala and His447His genotypes did not influence risk of PCOS or its component phenotypes in patients with PCOS. In controls, Pro12Ala did not influence measures of insulin resistance or androgen production. However, carriers of the His447His T-allele had significantly decreased free and total T levels, and a significantly decreased homeostasis model assessment index of insulin resistance. Furthermore, haplotypes in controls bearing the His447His T-allele were also associated with decreased T. CONCLUSION(S): Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma does not appear to be an important modifier gene in PCOS. In controls, however, the His447His T-allele may be in linkage disequilibrium with a functional variant that influences insulin resistance and T production.

TI	A C/T single nucleotide polymorphism at the tyrosine kinase domain of the insulin receptor gene is associated with polycystic ovary syndrome.
PG	1240-3
AB	OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the insulin receptor (INSR) gene contributes to genetic susceptibility to the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Academic endocrinology clinic. PATIENT(S): Ninety-nine women with PCOS as defined by the National Institutes of Health consensus and polycystic ovaries on ultrasonography, and 136 healthy controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Frequency of genotypes of a single nucleotide polymorphism of the INSR gene in patients and controls. RESULT(S): After stratification of participants by body mass index, the frequency of the uncommon T allele of the INSR single nucleotide polymorphism was significantly increased in lean patients with PCOS (body mass index &lt; or =27 kg/m2) compared with lean controls (relative risk, 2.1). CONCLUSION(S): The INSR gene is a susceptibility gene for PCOS among lean patients with PCOS. It remains to be determined whether the exon 17 C/T single nucleotide polymorphism is the susceptibility single nucleotide polymorphism for PCOS or whether it is in linkage disequilibrium with another INSR gene polymorphism.

TI	Inconsistent effects of the proline12 --&gt; alanine variant of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma2 gene on body mass index in children and adolescent girls.
PG	741-7
AB	OBJECTIVE: To ascertain whether variation in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma), a nuclear ligand-dependent transcription factor affecting both adipocyte differentiation and insulin sensitivity, influences body mass index (BMI). DESIGN: Association study. SETTING: Academic research environment. PATIENT(S): Children with premature pubic hair and adolescent girls with hyperandrogenism. INTERVENTION(S): Assay for P12A and P115Q variants and measure BMI. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): BMI and PPAR-gamma genotypes. RESULT(S): Fourteen subjects were heterozygous for P12A; two were homozygous. None carried the P115Q allele. No significant differences in BMI or basal androstenedione concentrations between P12 carriers and noncarriers were found. Thirty-nine subjects had BMI values at two time points; mean BMI was significantly greater in the P12A carriers at time point 2. Those P12A carriers obese at time point 1 became more obese; lean mutation carriers tended to remain lean. Annual rate of increase in BMI was significantly greater in the P12A carriers than the noncarriers. CONCLUSION(S): Our findings suggest that P12A may be a genetic marker indicating risk for obesity persisting into adolescence. Future studies are needed to determine whether the divergent effects of P12A persist into adulthood, to elucidate the mechanism of this effect, and to replicate our findings in other populations.

TI	Metabolic imprinting in obesity.
PG	186-94
AB	Increasing evidence indicates that early metabolic programming contributes to escalating obesity rates in children and adults. Metabolic imprinting is involved in the establishment of set points for physiologic and metabolic responses in adulthood. Evidence from epidemiological studies and animal models indicates that maternal health and nutritional status during gestation and lactation have long-term effects on central and peripheral systems that regulate energy balance in the developing offspring. Perinatal nutrition also impacts susceptibility to developing metabolic disorders and plays a role in programming body weight set points. The states of maternal energy status and health that are implicated in predisposing offspring to increased risk of developing obesity include maternal overnutrition, diabetes, and undernutrition. This chapter discusses the evidence from epidemiologic studies and animal models that each of these states of maternal energy status results in metabolic imprinting of obesity in offspring. Also, the potential molecular mediators of metabolic imprinting of obesity by maternal energy status including glucose, insulin, leptin, inflammatory cytokines and epigenetic mechanisms are considered.

TI	Early nutrition: impact on epigenetics.
PG	42-8
AB	BACKGROUND/AIMS: (1) To outline the findings that alterations in nutrition in utero and in early postnatal life influence health in later life. (2) To review the evidence that alterations in epigenetic markings may be a means by which the genome records environmental (including nutritional) exposure resulting in changes in gene expression and cell function which underlie susceptibility to disease. METHODS: Literature review. RESULTS: There is strong evidence that low birth weight, especially when followed by accelerated growth in childhood and greater central adiposity in adulthood, is a risk factor for a range of common diseases including cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Such observations provide the basis for the 'programming' hypothesis and present a challenge to discover the mechanisms by which nutritional insults in early life are received, recorded, remembered and then revealed in later life. Emerging evidence suggests that alterations in epigenetic marking of the genome may be a key mechanism by which nutritional exposure in utero can influence gene expression, and therefore, phenotype. CONCLUSION: Early life nutrition has the potential to change chromatin structure, to alter gene expression and to modulate health throughout the life course. Whether later interventions can reverse adverse epigenetic markings remains to be discovered.

TI	Familial liver adenomatosis associated with hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha inactivation.
PG	1470-5
AB	BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Germline mutations in hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (TCF1/HNF-1alpha) are associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3), and somatic biallelic inactivations of the gene are found in hepatocellular adenomas and liver adenomatosis. This study investigated cosegregation of HNF-1alpha germline mutations with diabetes and liver adenomatosis in 2 families. METHODS: Two unrelated patients with liver adenomatosis and harboring HNF-1alpha germline and somatic mutations were studied. Subsequently, we screened 9 relatives in the 2 independent families for diabetes, hepatocellular adenomas, and HNF-1alpha germline mutations. RESULTS: In family A, a father and his son presented with an intraperitoneal hemorrhagic rupture of a liver adenomatosis without diabetes. A heterozygous R229X germline mutation was identified in HNF-1alpha in the father and his son and also in his second 27-year-old son without hepatocellular adenomas. In family B, a diagnosis of liver adenomatosis was made fortuitously in a 14-year-old girl. A heterozygous G55fsX57 germline mutation in HNF-1alpha was identified in this patient, her diabetic father, and her 2 sisters. Systematic exploration showed liver adenomatosis in the 2 sisters. Somatic inactivation of the second HNF-1alpha allele was found in liver tumors in both families. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes familial liver adenomatosis and shows the association with germline HNF-1alpha mutations in adults and children. It also highlights the importance of screening for hepatocellular adenomas, diabetes, and HNF-1alpha germline mutations in relatives of patients with liver adenomatosis. Finally, prevalence of liver adenomatosis remains to be evaluated in MODY3 subjects.

TI	Inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor gene and allelic losses at chromosome arm 3p in primary renal cell carcinoma: evidence for a VHL-independent pathway in clear cell renal tumourigenesis.
PG	200-9
AB	Inactivation of tumour suppressor gene(s) (TSGs) on 3p appears to be a critical event in the pathogenesis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CC-RCC). Analysis of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in sporadic RCC samples has implicated roles for TSGs in three specific regions of 3p in RCC development: (1) 3p12-p14, which includes the breakpoint of the familial t(3;8) constitutional translocation involved in hereditary RCC development and a recently cloned putative TSG, the FHIT gene: (2) 3p21.2-p21.3, a common region of deletion in many cancers including lung; and (3) 3p25-p26, which contains the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease TSG. We and others have shown that most primary sporadic CC-RCCs contain somatic VHL gene mutations, clearly implicating inactivation of the VHL gene in the pathogenesis of CC-RCC. It is not known if CC-RCC without VHL gene mutations have alternative mechanisms of VHL gene inactivation or result from an alternative non-VHL pathway to RCC, e.g., inactivation of TSGs in 3p12-p21. We and others have reported hypermethylation and silencing of the VHL TSG in RCC from patients with VHL disease and in CC-RCC cell lines. However, the incidence and specificity of VHL methylation in primary sporadic RCC has not been defined. Therefore, we analysed methylation of the VHL, CDKN2, MYC, and H19 genes in primary RCC samples. Hypermethylation of the VHL promoter region was detected in 11% (11/99) of the primary RCCs analysed. In 10 of these tumours, there was no evidence of concomitant VHL gene mutation. VHL methylation was specific to CC-RCC (15%, 7/45) but was not detected in any non-CC tumours (n = 16). None of the 11 RCCs methylated at VHL had evidence of methylation at either CDKN2 or MYC (methylation at CDKN2 was, however, detected in 3%, or 1/33, of RCCs without VHL methylation). A normal methylation pattern at H19 was demonstrated in the three RCCs with methylated VHL analysed. Previous studies have suggested that, in addition to VHL, other 3p TSGs at 3p12-p14 and 3p21 may be involved in CC-RCC tumourigenesis. However, the interpretation of these studies has been difficult because information on VHL gene status has not been available for these data sets. Therefore, we investigated a subset of 55 sporadic RCCs (of known VHL gene methylation and mutation status) for LOH at polymorphic markers close to candidate TSG loci in the 3p14.2 and 3p21.2-p21.3 regions. Among tumours with LOH at one or more 3p markers, the incidence of 3p25 allele loss was higher in tumours with VHL alterations (mutation or methylation) than in those without. For tumours without detectable VHL alterations, the frequency of 3p14-p21 LOH was significantly higher than the frequency of 3p25-p26 LOH (93%, 13/14 vs. 43%, 6/14; P = 0.013), whereas, in RCC samples with VHL methylation or mutation, the frequency of 3p14-p21 LOH did not differ from that of sp25-p26 (72%, 18/25 vs. 59%, 13/22; P = 0.376). None of the 11 RCCs with 3p25 allele loss that were informative at 3p21 and 3p14 showed LOH at 3p25 only. These findings suggest that (1) VHL methylation is a specific and important event in the pathogenesis of CC-RCC; (2) in CC-RCC with 3p LOH but without VHL inactivation, mutations in TSGs at 3p14-p21 appear to have a primary role in tumourigenesis; and (3) inactivation of other 3p TSGs in addition to VHL may also be required for malignant transformation in tumours with VHL gene inactivation.

TI	Differential expression of a new dominant agouti allele (Aiapy) is correlated with methylation state and is influenced by parental lineage.
PG	1463-72
AB	The agouti gene normally confers the wild-type coat color of mice. Dominant mutations at the agouti locus result in a pleiotropic syndrome that is characterized by excessive amounts of yellow pigment in the coat, obesity, a non-insulin-dependent diabetic-like condition, and the propensity to form a variety of tumors. Here, we describe a new dominant mutation at the agouti locus in which an intracisternal A-particle (IAP) has integrated in an antisense orientation immediately 5' of the first coding exon of the gene. This mutation, which we have named Aiapy, results in the ectopic expression of the agouti gene through the utilization of a cryptic promoter within the IAP 5' long terminal repeat (LTR). The coat color of Aiapy/-mice ranges from solid yellow to a pigment pattern that is similar to wild type (pseudoagouti), and the expressivity of this mutant phenotype varies with parental inheritance. Those offspring with a yellow coat ectopically express agouti mRNA at high levels and exhibit marked obesity, whereas pseudoagouti mice express agouti mRNA at a very low level and their weights do not differ from wild-type littermates. Data are presented to show that the differential expressivity of the Aiapy allele is correlated with the methylation status of the inserted IAP 5' LTR. These data further support the hypothesis that in dominant yellow mutations at the agouti locus, it is the ubiquitous expression of the wild-type agouti coding sequence that is responsible for the yellow coat color, obesity, diabetes, and tumorigenesis.

TI	Association between type 1 diabetes and GWAS SNPs in the southeast US Caucasian population.
PG	208-12
AB	The present study was conducted to assess genetic associations for type 1 diabetes (T1D) reported in previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS). A total of 21 previously reported single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped by TaqMan assays in 1434 Caucasian T1D patients and 1864 normal controls from Georgia. Analysis of the samples identified 18 SNPs (PTPN22, INS, IFIH1, SH2B3, ERBB3, CTLA4, C14orf181, CTSH, CLEC16A, CD69, ITPR3, C6orf173, SKAP2, PRKCQ, RNLS, IL27, SIRPG and CTRB2) with putative association.

TI	rs2476601 T allele (R620W) defines high-risk PTPN22 type I diabetes-associated haplotypes with preliminary evidence for an additional protective haplotype.
PG	S21-6
AB	Protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22) is the third major locus affecting risk of type I diabetes (T1D), after HLA-DR/DQ and INS. The most associated single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs2476601, has a C-&gt;T variant and results in an arginine (R) to tryptophan (W) amino acid change at position 620. To assess whether this, or other specific variants, are responsible for T1D risk, the Type I Diabetes Genetics Consortium analyzed 28 PTPN22 SNPs in 2295 affected sib-pair (ASP) families. Transmission Disequilibrium Test analyses of haplotypes revealed that all three haplotypes with a T allele at rs2476601 were overtransmitted to affected children, and two of these three haplotypes showed statistically significant overtransmission (P=0.003 to P=5.9E-12). Another haplotype had decreased transmission to affected children (P=3.5E-05). All haplotypes containing the rs2476601 T allele were identical for all SNPs across PTPN22 and only varied at centromeric SNPs. When considering rs2476601 'C' founder chromosomes, a second haplotype (AGGGGC) centromeric of PTPN22 in the C1orf178 region was associated with protection from T1D (odds ratio=0.81, P=0.0005). This novel finding requires replication in independent populations. We conclude the major association of PTPN22 with T1D is likely due to the recognized non-synonymous SNP rs2476601 (R620W).

TI	Duplication within chromosome region 15q11-q13 in a patient with similarities to Prader-Willi syndrome confirmed by region-specific and band-specific fish.
PG	123-32
AB	We report on a patient presenting with mental retardation and obesity and a proximal duplication of chromosome 15. The patient shared some clinical signs with Prader-Willi syndrome. With a region-specific paint, generated by microdissection, a duplication in region 15q11.2-q13 was shown to be present. Subsequently, FISH with probes localized to chromosome region 15q11.2-q12 and microsatellite analysis was used to characterize this chromosome aberration further and an insertion duplication within the region frequently deleted in Prader-Willi and Angelman syndrome was demonstrated.

TI	Summary of contributions to GAW Group 15: family-based samples are useful in identifying common polymorphisms associated with complex traits.
PG	S99-104
AB	Traditionally, family-based samples have been used for genetic analyses of single-gene traits caused by rare but highly penetrant risk variants. The utility of family-based genetic data for analyzing common complex traits is unclear and contains numerous challenges. To assess the utility as well as to address these challenges, members of Genetic Analysis Workshop 16 Group 15 analyzed Framingham Heart Study data using family-based designs ranging from parent--offspring trios to large pedigrees. We investigated different methods including traditional linkage tests, family-based association tests, and population-based tests that correct for relatedness between subjects, and tests to detect parent-of-origin effects. The analyses presented an assortment of positive findings. One contribution found increased power to detect epistatic effects through linkage using ascertainment of sibships based on extreme quantitative values or presence of disease associated with the quantitative value. Another contribution found four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showing a maternal effect, two SNPs with an imprinting effect, and one SNP having both effects on a binary high blood pressure trait. Finally, three contributions illustrated the advantage of using population-based methods to detect association to complex binary or quantitative traits. Our findings highlight the contribution of family-based samples to the genetic dissection of complex traits.

TI	Linkage between the APOB gene and serum ApoB levels in a large pedigree from the Bogalusa Heart Study.
PG	29-40
AB	Maximum likelihood linkage analyses were performed to test for linkage between serum apoB levels and several candidate gene markers including apolipoprotein B, lipoprotein lipase, hepatic lipase, cholesterol ester transfer protein, and apolipoprotein AI in a large pedigree. Parameters of general Mendelian inheritance derived from maximum likelihood segregation analysis of the serum apoB levels were used in the linkage analysis. The highest two-point lod score between the quantitative trait and a marker defined by a single restriction digest was 1.86 at recombination fraction (theta) = 0. This was observed for linkage between serum apoB levels and the presence or absence of a PvuII digestion site in the apoB gene. Linkage between serum apoB levels and polymorphisms of the apoB gene defined by the two restriction digests EcoR1 and PvuII was supported by a lod score of 3.30, while inclusion of VNTR typings led to a lod score of 2.33. None of the other candidate genes gave positive evidence of linkage.

TI	Clues to IDDM pathogenesis from genetic and serological traits in multiply affected families.
PG	117-22
AB	A scheme is outlined for analyzing the genotypic contributions of two unlinked loci in producing a disease, using DR and the 5' insulin locus (INS) in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) as examples. Although genotypes of both DR and INS play roles in IDDM susceptibility, both the relatively small size of the Genetic Analysis Workshop 5 (GAW5) data set and the apparently limited magnitudes of the contributory effects prevent the identification of the exact nature of the association of these two loci in disease causation. The Gm allotypes showed no association with IDDM, either alone or in combination with other variables. Association of reactivity among the six strains of Coxsackie B virus is described, with no evidence of associations with DR type and IDDM found. The unaffected offspring segregated DR alleles according to expectations, while the segregation of affected alleles revealed the various contributions of DR alleles to IDDM pathogenesis, with the suggestion that DR4 from fathers is more diabetogenic than that from mothers. Lastly, a method is described for revealing the accuracy of typing in family data, and applied to RFLP variants subdividing DR3.

TI	Analysis of imprinted genes in subjects with Prader-Willi syndrome and chromosome 15 abnormalities.
PG	141-5
AB	PURPOSE: To determine gene expression of five imprinted genes or transcripts from the 15q11-q13 chromosome region using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in a relatively large survey of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and control subjects with several different chromosome 15 abnormalities. METHODS: RT-PCR was undertaken on mRNA isolated from tissue (e.g., mostly lymphoblasts) from 38 PWS and 10 control subjects. DNA primers were used for five imprinted genes or transcripts (ZNF127, SNRPN, PAR5, IPW, and PAR1) from 15q11-q13 and fibrillin, a control gene from 15q21. RESULTS: One PWS subject with maternal disomy 15 showed weak but detectable expression of PAR1, whereas SNRPN expression was detected in two PWS subjects [one with the 15q11-q13 deletion and one with a t(15;15) karyotype and maternal disomy 15], and the remaining typical PWS subjects showed no expression of the imprinted genes or transcripts. CONCLUSION: No obvious clinical differences were identified in those PWS subjects with weak expression of genes compared with those showing no expression. Although the reason(s) for weak expression is unknown, possible explanations include relaxation of imprinting caused by failure to reset the imprinted genes or transcripts in the maternal germ line or by postzygotic gene expression or undetected chromosome 15 mosaicism in the deletion PWS subjects. The timing, tissue source, and other factors relating to partial expression of genes that are thought to be imprinted may play a role in clinical variability and allow for a better understanding of molecular mechanisms in PWS and other abnormalities of proximal chromosome 15q.

TI	LEPR p.Q223R, beta3-AR p.W64R and LEP c.-2548G&gt;A gene variants in obese Brazilian subjects.
PG	1035-43
AB	Obesity is due to the combined effects of genes, environment, lifestyle, and the interactions of these factors. The adrenergic receptor beta3 (beta3-AR), leptin (LEP) and leptin receptor (LEPR) genes have been intensively evaluated in the search of variants that could be related to obesity and its cardiometabolic complications. The results of most of these studies have been controversial. In the present study, we investigated the relationship of the beta3-AR p.W64R, LEP c.-2548G&gt;A and LEPR p.Q223R gene variants with body mass index (BMI), in Brazilian subjects of different genetic backgrounds and ethnic origins. Two hundred obese patients (60 males, 140 females, BMI &gt; or = 30 kg/m2) were screened and compared to 150 lean healthy subjects (63 males, 87 females, BMI &lt; or = 24 kg/m2). Genomic DNA was extracted and amplified by polymerase chain reaction. Polymerase chain reaction products were digested with specific restriction enzymes and separated by electrophoresis. There was no significant difference in the genotype frequency of the beta3-AR p.W64R and the LEP c.-2548G&gt;A polymorphisms, between lean and obese subjects. However, the genotype and allele frequencies of the LEPR p.Q223R variant were significantly different between the normal weight and obese groups. Haplotype analysis has shown an association between the G/G allelic combination of c.-2548G&gt;A LEP and c.668A&gt;G LEPR, in obese subjects. Our results suggest that genetic variability in the leptin receptor is associated with body weight regulation, the LEPR p.Q223R variant being related to BMI increase. The haplotype combination of LEP c.-2548G&gt;A and LEPR p.Q223R variants was related to a 58% increase in obesity risk.

TI	A three-step molecular protocol employing DNA obtained from dried blood spots for neonatal screening for 45,X Turner syndrome.
PG	749-54
AB	Turner syndrome (TS) is one of the most common human chromosomal abnormalities; it is characterized by the presence of one normal X chromosome and the complete or partial loss of the second X chromosome. The early recognition of TS patients allows for adequate therapy for short stature and pubertal sex steroid substitution. We developed a cost-effective molecular diagnostic tool that can be used to identify 45,X TS patients from dried blood spots, for possible use in neonatal screening for TS. We used a three-step method for 45,X TS detection: i) DNA extraction from dried blood spot samples, ii) pre-PCR HpaII digestion (methylation-sensitive enzyme) and iii) GeneScan analysis of selected cases. DAX-1 gene amplification was used to recognize DNA integrity, and the androgen receptor gene (Xq11-12), which is both a highly polymorphic and methylated gene, was used to determine the number of X chromosome alleles. Using this three-step diagnostic procedure, we detected apparent TS in 1/304 (0.33%) samples; such individuals should be submitted to clinical examination and karyotype confirmation. The three-step 45,X TS neonatal screening protocol is a simple, reliable, fast (under 30 h) and cost-effective diagnostic tool, useful for the neonatal detection of TS.

TI	Methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis of subjects with chromosome 15 abnormalities.
PG	467-75
AB	Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) are neurodevelopmental disorders caused by loss of expression of imprinted genes from the 15q11-q13 region. They arise from similar defects in the region but differ in parent of origin. There are two recognized typical 15q11-q13 deletions depending on size and several diagnostic assays are available but each has limitations. We evaluated the usefulness of a methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) kit consisting of 43 probes to detect copy number changes and methylation status in the region. We used the MLPA kit to genotype 82 subjects with chromosome 15 abnormalities (62 PWS, 10 AS and 10 individuals with other chromosome 15 abnormalities) and 13 with normal cytogenetic findings. We developed an algorithm for MLPA probe analysis which correctly identified methylation abnormalities associated with PWS and AS and accurately determined copy number in previously assigned genetic subtypes including microdeletions of the imprinting center. Furthermore, MLPA analysis identified copy number changes in those with distal 15q deletions and ring 15s. MLPA is a relatively simple, cost-effective technique found to be useful and accurate for methylation status, copy number and analysis of genetic subtype in PWS and AS, as well as other chromosome 15 abnormalities.

TI	Prader-Willi syndrome: genetic tests and clinical findings.
PG	387-92
AB	Here we describe the genetic studies performed in 53 patients with the suspected diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). PWS is characterized by neonatal hypotonia, hypogonadism, delayed psychomotor development, hyperphagia, obesity, short stature, small hands and feet, learning disabilities, and obsessive-compulsive behavior. Through the methylation analysis of the SNRPN gene, microsatellite studies of loci mapped within and outside the PWS/AS region, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) study, we confirmed the diagnosis in 35 patients: 27 with a paternal deletion, and 8 with maternal uniparental disomy (UPD). The clinical comparisons between deleted and UPD patients indicated that there were no major phenotype differences, except for a lower birth length observed in the UPD children. Our sample was composed of more girls than boys; UPD patients were diagnosed earlier than the deleted cohort (2(10/12) s. 7(9/12) years); and, in the deleted group, the boys were diagnosed earlier than the girls (5(2/12) vs. 7(8/12) years, respectively).

TI	Relationship between the angiotensin I-converting enzyme insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism and cardiovascular risk factors in healthy young Mexican women.
PG	237-42
AB	AIMS: Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism has been associated with the genetic susceptibility to several cardiovascular diseases; however, its association with cardiovascular risk factors (CRFs) in different populations needs to be clarified. The purpose of this study was to identify the CRF patterns associated with the ACE I/D polymorphism in women from different Mexican communities. METHODS: ACE I/D polymorphism was determined in two groups of healthy young women: 105 from an urban community and 59 from a semi-urban community using the polymerase chain reaction technique. Distributions of clinical and laboratory profiles among I/D genotypes were analyzed. RESULTS: Women from the semi-urban community had significantly larger waist diameter and higher diastolic blood pressure than women from the urban community (p = 0.003 and p = 0.0055). Differences in the distribution of total cholesterol (p = 0.0008), triglycerides (p = 0.0091), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (p = 0.0272) between genotypes in each community were identified. Women with II genotype had larger values of these CRFs. Estimated risks showed that women from the urban community with the II genotype have three times more risk of having abnormal LDL-C values than women with ID genotype (p = 0.041). Estimated risks between women from semi-urban and urban community showed that urban women have 2.7 and 2.2 times more risk to have abnormal values of LDL-C and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, respectively (p = 0.010 and p = 0.029), and that women from semi-urban community have three times more risk of having a waist diameter above 80 cm compared to the urban community (p = 0.011). CONCLUSION: The results showed that II homozygous women have higher risk of having high levels lipids and triglycerides than women with ID genotype.

TI	Association between nuclear lamin A/C R482Q mutation and partial lipodystrophy with hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes.
PG	652-8
AB	Nuclear lamins A and C are encoded by LMNA and are present in terminally differentiated cells. Lamins participate in DNA replication, chromatin organization, arrangement of nuclear pores, nuclear growth, and anchorage of nuclear membranes. In several Canadian probands with partial lipodystrophy, since found to have a common ancestor, we identified a rare novel LMNA mutation, R482Q, that completely cosegregated with the partial lipodystrophy phenotype. We evaluated the relationship between quantitative metabolic phenotypes in both diabetic and nondiabetic carriers of LMNA R482Q and family controls, who were LMNA R482/R482 homozygotes. We found that when compared with LMNA R482/R482 homozygotes: (1) diabetic LMNA Q482/R482 heterozygotes had significantly higher glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, triglycerides, insulin and C-peptide, and significantly lower HDL cholesterol; and (2) nondiabetic LMNA Q482/R482 heterozygotes had significantly higher triglycerides, insulin and C-peptide, and significantly lower HDL cholesterol. We also found that diabetic LMNA Q482/R482 heterozygotes were older and more likely to take antihypertensive medications. Thus, LMNA R482Q was associated with lipodystrophy, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and hypertension. The results indicate that perturbations in plasma lipids precede the plasma glucose abnormalities in LMNA Q482-associated hyperinsulinemia. Thus, rare mutations in a nuclear structural protein can be associated with markedly abnormal qualitative and quantitative metabolic phenotypes

TI	[Spontaneous menstruation in patients with Turner syndrome in our observations].
PG	1245-52
AB	OBJECTIVES: Patients with Turner syndrome (TS) may present a wide spectrum of gonadal function including spontaneous menstruation and fertility. DESIGN: The aim of our study was to present the patients with Turner syndrome (TS) with spontaneous menstruations considering specific karyotype and X-inactivation processes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 5 women from group of 55 patients in age from 15 to 38 years with diagnosis of TS and gonadal function were found. Clinical analysis included the evaluation of spontaneous pubertal development and hormones levels. Cytogenetic analysis was performed on peripheral blood samples using GTG banding technique. X inactivation studies were done by dynamic RBG technique. RESULTS: In two patients with mosaic karyotype and predominant 46,XX line two pregnancies were observed. They had regular menses and normal sexual development. In one patient (karyotype: 45,X[2]/46,XX[98]) spontaneous abortions and premature birth were present. Second patient was (46,XX[245]/46,X,r(X)(p22q26)[5]) in pregnancy in this time. Another three patients menstruated irregularly. The menarche appeared later. The karyotypes were: 46,X,del(X)(p11.3) in two patients and 45,X[64]46,X,r(X) (p22q26)[18]/46,XX[4] in one. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that spontaneous menstruations and possibility of pregnancy depend on specific karyotype in patients with TS.

TI	The roles of aquaporin-4 in brain edema following neonatal hypoxia ischemia and reoxygenation in a cultured rat astrocyte model.
PG	935-41
AB	Aquaporin-4 (AQP4), a water channel protein, is abundantly expressed in astrocytes and plays a key role in the development of brain edema. However, it is not clear whether AQP4 contributes to astrocytic swelling in hypoxia-ischemia (HI). To investigate the roles of AQP4 in astrocytic swelling during HI and reoxygenation, we measured AQP4 expression and astrocytic cellular volume in cultured rat astrocytes following HI and reoxygenation. RNA interference was used to knockdown AQP4 expression (AQP4(-/-)). Real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis were used to detect the inhibitory efficiency of AQP4. We found that the maximal inhibition of AQP4 mRNA and protein in astrocytes after AQP4 siRNA transfection (AQP4(-/-)) was approximately 77 and 85%, respectively, compared to wild-type AQP4 (AQP4(+/+)) expression. Cellular volume in both AQP4(-/-) and AQP4(+/+) astrocytes was significantly increased during HI compared to cells cultured in normoxia (P&lt;0.05). However, cellular volume during HI in AQP4(-/-) astrocytes was significantly less than that in AQP4(+/+) astrocytes (P&lt;0.05). After reoxygenation, the cellular volume gradually decreased to control levels at 7 days in AQP4(-/-) but at 5 days in AQP4(+/+) astrocytes. The different roles of AQP4 during HI and reoxygenation suggest that AQP4 knockdown may protect against water influx in the formation of astrocyte swelling during HI, and may also delay water clearance in the resolution of astrocyte swelling during reoxygenation. In conclusion, AQP4 mediates bidirectional transport of water across astrocytes during HI and reoxygenation. AQP4 manipulation may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy during different periods of hypoxic-ischemic brain edema in neonates.

TI	No loss of genomic imprinting of IGF-II and H19 in placentas of diabetic pregnancies with fetal macrosomia.
PG	130-6
AB	OBJECTIVES: Fetal macrosomia is a common complication of maternal diabetes mellitus and is associated with substantial morbidity, but the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms that induce fetal macrosomia are not well understood. The imprinted genes IGF-II and H19 are crucial for placental development and fetal growth. The term placentas from diabetic pregnancies express more insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) than those from normal pregnancies. Deregulation of their imprinting status is observed in the macrosomia-associated syndrome, the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. The aim of this study was to determine whether loss of imprinting hence biallelic expression was also a hallmark of macrosomia in diabetic pregnancies. DESIGN AND METHODS: IGF-II and H19 maternal and paternal expressions were studied in placentas from two groups of type 1 diabetic mothers: one with macrosomic babies and the other with babies of normal weight. Maternal or paternal allele specific expressions were defined by using DNA polymorphic markers of the IGF-II and H19 genes. RFLP analysis was performed on PCR products from genomic DNA of the father, the mother and the child, and on RT-PCR products from placental mRNA. RESULTS: RFLP analysis showed that the IGF-II gene remains paternally expressed and the H19 gene remains maternally expressed in all placentas examined, independently of the birth weight status. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that, in contrast with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome-associated macrosomia, loss of imprinting for IGF-II or H19 is not a common feature of diabetic pregnancies associated with macrosomia.

TI	Endocrine and metabolic aspects of adult Prader-Willi syndrome with special emphasis on the effect of growth hormone treatment.
PG	1-15
AB	Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder characterized by mild mental retardation, short stature, abnormal body composition, muscular hypotonia and distinctive behavioural features. Excessive eating causes progressive obesity with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In the PWS genotype loss of one or more normally active paternal genes in region q11-13 on chromosome 15 is seen. It is supposed that the genetic alteration leads to dysfunction of several hypothalamic centres and growth hormone (GH) deficiency (GHD) is common. PWS is well described in children, in whom GH treatment improves body composition, linear growth, physical strength and agility. Few studies have focused on adults. We examined a cohort of 19 young adults with clinical PWS (13 with positive genotype) and mean BMI of 35 kg/m2. At baseline the activity of the GH-insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) system was impaired with low GH values, low total IGF-I and in relation to the obesity low levels of free IGF-I and non-suppressed IGF-binding-protein-1 (IGFBP-1). 2/3 were hypogonadal. Bone mineral density (BMD) was low. Four patients had impaired glucose tolerance and nine patients high homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index, indicating insulin resistance. Seven patients had a moderate dyslipidemia. The 13 patients with the PWS genotype were shorter and had significantly lower IGF-I. Seventeen (9 men and 8 women), subsequently completed a 12 months GH treatment trial, and GH had beneficial effects on body composition without significant adverse effects. The effects were more pronounced in the patients with the PWS genotype. Analysis of peptides involved in appetite regulation showed that leptin levels were high reflecting obesity and as a consequence NPY levels were low. In relation to the patients obesity circulating oxytocin levels were abnormally low and ghrelin levels abnormally high. Thus, oxytocin and ghrelin might be involved in the hyperphagia. NPY, leptin and ghrelin did not change during GH treatment. In conclusion this pilot study showed that adults with PWS have a partial GH deficiency, and GH treatment has beneficial effects on body composition in adult PWS without significant side-effects. Larger and longer term studies on the effect of GH replacement in adult PWS are encouraged.

TI	The contributions of resistin and adiponectin gene single nucleotide polymorphisms to the genetic risk for polycystic ovary syndrome in a Japanese population.
PG	498-503
AB	Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous group of disorders that occur fairly commonly in women of reproductive age and are characterized by a variety of clinical manifestations, including insulin resistance that is independent of obesity. Recent studies suggest that altered adipocytokine gene expression is closely associated with insulin resistance and that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) modulate the expression and/or function of these genes, thereby affecting insulin sensitivity. With that in mind, we investigated whether SNPs at position -420 of the resistin gene (RETN) and/or -11377 of the adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) modulate the susceptibility to PCOS. We evaluated the genotypes of 117 women with PCOS and 380 healthy fertile controls and measured the index of insulin resistance and hormonal profiles in the PCOS women. The RETN-420G/G homozygous variant genotype occurred significantly more frequently among the PCOS group than among the control group (15.4% vs. 8.4%, p = 0.035). PCOS women with the RETN-420G/G genotype also showed significantly higher BMIs and greater insulin resistance than those with RETN-420 C/C or C/G genotypes. The ADIPOQ SNP at -11377 showed no association with PCOS. We conclude that the RETN G/G at -420 genotype is associated with PCOS in Japanese women.

TI	[Early recurrent spontaneous abortion: How to take care in 2006?].
PG	927-37
AB	More than 1% of the couples whishing children suffer from recurrent miscarriage, but investigations and treatment are not consensual. Most patients have several risk factors, and a minimum investigation of known factors has to be undertaken: karyotyping of the couple, hysteroscopy for searching uterine anatomic anomalies, evaluation for thrombophilias (anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, protein C activity, Proteine S activity, factor V Leiden and factor II mutations, activated protein C resistance), antinuclear antibodies. Systemic diseases (like lupus) and endocrine abnormalities (like thyroid diseases and diabetes mellitus) have to be detected by clinical examination and questioning. No endocrine investigation is recommended, unless irregular menstruations or sterility. Research in recurrent pregnancy loss are conducted in new associated factors, such as skewed-X-chromosome inactivation, maternal HLA types, modifications in specific immune molecules and cells regulation. Therapeutic proposals are preimplantation genetic diagnosis in case of abnormal karyotiping, hysteroscopic surgery for septate uterus, aspirin plus heparin in antiphospholipid-positive patients, and aspirin plus corticosteroids in systemic lupus. Heparin seems to improve obstetrical prognosis for patients with congenital or acquired thrombophilias, but there are only few studies carried out on the subject. This new therapeutic approach should incite the patients with a negative medical appraisal to be referred to specialized consultations in order to include them in eventual clinical tests. Finally, empathic listening and psychological support are necessary in a pathology with multiple etiological factors.

PG	1151-2
AB	Fibrinogen is an essential component of the coagulation cascade and the acute phase response. The native 340 kDa molecule has a symmetrical trinodular structure composed of a central E-domain connected to outer D-domains by triple helical coiled-coils.1 Several mutations known to cause hypofibrinogenemia occur within the C-terminal gammaD-domain and have helped to elucidate the structurally and functionally important areas of this domain.2-5 Here we report the identification of a novel point mutation gammaG200V (fibrinogen Columbus) causing hypofibrinogenemia and co-segregating with three genetic thrombophilia risk factors.

TI	Novel therapies in childhood heart failure: today and tomorrow.
PG	591-621, x
AB	Heart failure is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals of all ages. The many-faceted nature of the clinical heart failure syndrome has historically frustrated attempts to develop an overarching explanative theory. However, much useful information has been gained by basic and clinical investigation, even though a comprehensive understanding of heart failure has been elusive. Heart failure is a growing problem, in both adult and pediatric populations, for which standard medical therapy, as of 2010, can have positive effects, but these are usually limited and progressively diminish with time in most patients. If we want curative or near-curative therapy that will return patients to a normal state of health at a feasible cost, much better diagnostic and therapeutic technologies need to be developed. This review addresses the vexing group of heart failure etiologies that include cardiomyopathies and other ventricular dysfunctions of various types, for which current therapy is only modestly effective. Although there are many unique aspects to heart failure in patients with pediatric and congenital heart disease, many of the innovative approaches that are being developed for the care of adults with heart failure will be applicable to heart failure in childhood.

PG	14-39
AB	The outlook for patients with sickle cell disease has improved steadily during the last two decades. In spite of these improvements, curative therapies are currently available only to a small minority of patients. The main theme of this chapter is to describe new therapeutic options that are at different stages of development that might result in further improvements in the outlook for patients with these disorders. Dr. Joseph DeSimone and his colleagues had previously made the important observation that the hypomethylating agent 5-azacytidine can reverse the switch from adult to fetal hemoglobin in adult baboons. Although similar activity was demonstrated in patients with sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia, concern about the toxicity of 5-azacytidine prevented its widespread use in these disorders. In Section I, Dr. DeSimone discusses the role of DNA methylation in globin gene regulation and describe recent clinical experience with decitabine (an analogue of 5-azacytidine) in patients with sickle cell disease. These encouraging studies demonstrate significant fetal hemoglobin inducing activity of decitabine in patients who fail to respond to hydroxyurea. In Section II, Dr. George Atweh continues the same theme by describing recent progress in the study of butyrate, another inducer of fetal hemoglobin, in patients with sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia. The main focus of his section is on the use of a combination of butyrate and hydroxyurea to achieve higher levels of fetal hemoglobin that might be necessary for complete amelioration of the clinical manifestations of these disorders. Dr. Atweh also describes novel laboratory studies that shed new light on the mechanisms of fetal hemoglobin induction by butyrate. In Section III, Dr. Ronald Nagel discusses the different available transgenic sickle mice as experimental models for human sickle cell disease. These experimental models have already had a significant impact on our understanding of the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease. Dr. Nagel describes more recent studies in which transgenic sickle mice provide the first proof of principle that globin gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells inhibits in vivo sickling and ameliorates the severity of the disease. Although stroke in adult patients with sickle cell disease is not as common as in children, adult hematologists, like their pediatric colleagues, need to make management decisions in adult patients with a stroke or a history of stroke. Dr. Robert Adams has led several large clinical studies that investigated the role of transfusions in the prevention of stroke in children with sickle cell disease. Much less is known, however, about the prevention of first or subsequent strokes in adult patients with sickle cell disease. In Section IV, Dr. Adams provides some general guidelines for the management of adult patients with stroke while carefully distinguishing between recommendations that are evidence-based and those that are anecdotal in nature.

TI	A common variant in the patatin-like phospholipase 3 gene (PNPLA3) is associated with fatty liver disease in obese children and adolescents.
PG	1281-90
AB	The genetic factors associated with susceptibility to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in pediatric obesity remain largely unknown. Recently, a nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs738409), in the patatin-like phospholipase 3 gene (PNPLA3) has been associated with hepatic steatosis in adults. In a multiethnic group of 85 obese youths, we genotyped the PNLPA3 single-nucleotide polymorphism, measured hepatic fat content by magnetic resonance imaging and insulin sensitivity by the insulin clamp. Because PNPLA3 might affect adipogenesis/lipogenesis, we explored the putative association with the distribution of adipose cell size and the expression of some adipogenic/lipogenic genes in a subset of subjects who underwent a subcutaneous fat biopsy. Steatosis was present in 41% of Caucasians, 23% of African Americans, and 66% of Hispanics. The frequency of PNPLA3(rs738409) G allele was 0.324 in Caucasians, 0.183 in African Americans, and 0.483 in Hispanics. The prevalence of the G allele was higher in subjects showing hepatic steatosis. Surprisingly, subjects carrying the G allele showed comparable hepatic glucose production rates, peripheral glucose disposal rate, and glycerol turnover as the CC homozygotes. Carriers of the G allele showed smaller adipocytes than those with CC genotype (P = 0.005). Although the expression of PNPLA3, PNPLA2, PPARgamma2(peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 2), SREBP1c(sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c), and ACACA(acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase) was not different between genotypes, carriers of the G allele showed lower leptin (LEP)(P = 0.03) and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) expression (P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: A common variant of the PNPLA3 gene confers susceptibility to hepatic steatosis in obese youths without increasing the level of hepatic and peripheral insulin resistance. The rs738409 PNPLA3 G allele is associated with morphological changes in adipocyte cell size.

TI	Autoimmune regulator AIRE: evidence for genetic differences between autoimmune hepatitis and hepatitis as part of the autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1.
PG	1047-52
AB	The mechanisms driving the immune-mediated destruction of hepatic tissues in autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) are unknown. Recently the autoimmune regulator (AIRE), a gene associated with the development of the autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1 (APS-1), was cloned. About 15% to 20% of APS-1 patients develop hepatitis. However, the role of AIRE mutations in AIH, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is not known. To address this issue patients with AIH (n = 94), PSC (n = 60), and PBC (n = 30) were analyzed for the presence of mutations in exons 6, 8, and 10 of AIRE by single stranded conformation polymorphism and sequence analysis. Autoantibody patterns of patients with defects in AIRE were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot. Heterozygous mutations of AIRE were identified in 3 patients: a patient with PBC and a patient with AIH type 1 carried a R257X mutation, and a patient with AIH type 2, diabetes mellitus type 1 (IDDM), thyroid disease, and atrophic gastritis carried a G305S mutation in the first PHD ring finger domain of the AIRE protein. None of the 3 patients with a defective AIRE allele showed autoantibodies, which are known to associate with APS-1. These findings show a differential genetic association of autoimmune liver diseases and hepatitis in APS-1. The subgroup of patients with heterozygous mutations in AIRE does not represent patients with an incomplete APS-1 syndrome. However, the Aire gene defect showed that genes involved in the induction of immunologic tolerance provide candidates for etiologic factors in autoimmune liver diseases.

TI	HLA and non-HLA genetic factors in Japanese IDDM.
PG	780-93
AB	The HLA of 56 unrelated Japanese with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) was investigated and reconfirmed their role in the pathogenesis by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). DQw4 showed the highest correlation to IDDM not only within the DQ system but among all the antigens, suggesting that HLA-DQ might play the most important role in the development of IDDM similar as in Caucasians. When the amino acid sequences of DQA1 and DQB1 alleles were analyzed to find susceptibility to IDDM, common features were observed. That is, in any ethnic group, DQA1 alleles of non-Leu at 76th residue combined with DQB1 alleles of non-Asp at 57th residue show association with IDDM, whereas other combinations give rise to negative association. However, two exceptions were observed in case of Japanese IDDM patients with DQw4 and DQw9. Since DQw4 and DQw9 are in strong linkage disequilibrium with DRB1 containing non-Asp-57th, mixed isotype molecules of DQA1 and DRB1 might be responsible to determine IDDM susceptibility. Furthermore, several non-HLA genes, the polymorphism in the genes encoding the alpha (A), beta (B) and gamma (G) chains of the T-cell receptor (TCRA, TCRB and TCRG), insulin gene (INS) and three closely linked polymorphic genes on chromosome 11q23; Thy-1 (THY1), T3-D (CD3D) and c-ets proto oncogene (ETS1) were analyzed. Only the EST1 gene showed a significant association with IDDM by AvaII-polymorphic fragment (P less than 0.03). These results were discordant with some of the strongly associated genes observed in Caucasians. The discrepancy of the HLA and non-HLA results between both ethnic groups is discussed.

TI	Sex-specificity in transgenerational epigenetic programming.
PG	290-5
AB	Prenatal programming of the epigenome is a critical determinant in offspring outcome and stands at the interface between environment and genetics. Maternal experiences such as stress and obesity are associated with a host of neurodevelopmental and metabolic diseases, some of which have been characterized into the second and third generations. The mechanism through which determinants such as maternal diet or stress contribute to disease development likely involves a complex interaction between the maternal environment, placental changes, and epigenetic programming of the embryo. While we have begun to more fully appreciate and explore the epigenome in determination of disease risk, we know little as to the contribution embryo sex makes in epigenetic regulation. This review discusses the importance of sex differences in the transmission and inheritance of traits that are generated in the prenatal environment using models of maternal stress and diet.

TI	TCF7L2 polymorphism rs7903146 and predisposition for type 2 diabetes mellitus in obese children.
PG	713-7
AB	Polymorphism RS7903146 in transcription factor 7-like2 gene ( TCF7L2) is associated with type 2-diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in adults. Concerned with predisposition for diabetes mellitus in obese children, we tested if risk genotypes TC and TT of rs7903146 are more common in obese children with increased homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) compared to obese controls with normal HOMA-IR. As exploratory analysis, we also calculated beta-cell function for these risk genotypes and measured glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) in a subgroup. The cohort was 401 obese children (BMI &gt; 2SDS; 211 female; 59% presenting increased HOMA-IR) from two German outpatient obesity referral centers. Genotype distributions in patients presenting increased HOMA-IR (TT: 10.18%, CT: 35.65%, CC: 54.17%) and in patients with normal HOMA-IR (TT: 8.66%, CT: 42.67%, CC: 48.67%) provided no significant effect of these two risk genotypes (p &gt; 0.2). Correction for possible confounder's gender, age, pubertal stage, and BMI revealed no association with glucose metabolism parameters including GLP-1. However, exploratory HOMA-B% index was comparatively higher in TT-homozygotes (p=0.021) as compared to CC-homozygotes. We conclude that even though TT and CT genotypes were not higher in patients presenting elevated HOMA-IR, the higher HOMA-B% index in TT-homozygotes indicates TCF7L2 to be a susceptibility gene for the development of impaired glucose tolerance in obese children as demonstrated in several adult cohort studies.

TI	Influence of the PPAR-gamma2 Pro12Ala and ACE I/D polymorphisms on insulin sensitivity and training effects in healthy offspring of type 2 diabetic subjects.
PG	99-105
AB	Aerobic endurance training improves insulin sensitivity, and is of great importance in the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes. The improvement in insulin sensitivity and cardiovascular function through exercise is highly variable among individuals, and is probably partly determined by genetic components. This study evaluated the peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor-gamma2 ( PPAR-gamma2) Pro12Ala polymorphism and the angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE) I/D polymorphism with respect to any potential influence that these highly prevalent polymorphisms may impose on changes in insulin sensitivity and maximal aerobic capacity induced by exercise. Seventy-nine healthy first-degree relatives of type 2 diabetic patients were compared to a control group consisting of 54 subjects without any family history of type 2 diabetes. All subjects had a normal OGTT. The groups were comparable with respect to age (34 +/	7 vs. 33 +/	7 years), gender ((m/f) 43/36 vs. 30/24) and BMI (25.7 +/	2.6 vs. 25.3 +/	2.5 kg/m (2)); p (all) = NS. Furthermore, a subgroup of 29 offspring and 17 control subjects were engaged in a standardized training program lasting ten weeks. Insulin sensitivity (hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp technique) and VO (2)max (exhaustive exercise test) was assessed before and after the training period. We will demonstrate the allelic frequency of the Ala-allele of the Pro12Ala polymorphism to be lower in offspring to type 2 diabetic patients (13.3 %) compared to control subjects (21.3 %); p &lt; 0.05. In offspring only, the Pro12Ala polymorphism of the PPAR-gamma2 gene appeared to enhance weight changes brought about by exercise (Deltaweight =	0.3 +/	1.4 kg vs.	1.8 +/	1.8 kg; p &lt; 0.05; (Pro/Pro vs. Pro/Ala + Ala/Ala)	suggesting possible gene-environment or gene-gene interactions. The ACE I/D polymorphism was not of significant importance in determining the capability of responding to exercise in terms of improvement in insulin sensitivity or maximal aerobic capacity.

TI	Cognition and the sex chromosomes: studies in Turner syndrome.
PG	47-56
AB	Turner syndrome (TS) is a human genetic disorder involving females who lack all or part of one X chromosome. The complex phenotype includes ovarian failure, a characteristic neurocognitive profile and typical physical features. TS features are associated not only with complete monosomy X but also with partial deletions of either the short (Xp) or long (Xq) arm (partial monosomy X). Impaired visual-spatial/perceptual abilities are characteristic of TS children and adults of varying races and socioeconomic status, but global developmental delay is uncommon. The cognitive phenotype generally includes normal verbal function with relatively impaired visual-spatial ability, attention, working memory, and spatially dependent executive function. The constellation of neurocognitive deficits observed in TS is most likely multifactorial and related to a complex interaction between genetic abnormalities and hormonal deficiencies. Furthermore, other determinants, including an additional genetic mechanism, imprinting, may also contribute to cognitive deficits associated with monosomy X. As a relatively common genetic disorder with well-defined manifestations, TS presents an opportunity to investigate genetic and hormonal factors that influence female cognitive development. TS is an excellent model for such studies because of its prevalence, the well-characterized phenotype, and the wealth of molecular resources available for the X chromosome. In the current review, we summarize the hormonal and genetic factors that may contribute to the TS neurocognitive phenotype. The hormonal determinants of cognition in TS are related to estrogen and androgen deficiency. Our genetic hypothesis is that haploinsufficiency for gene/genes on the short arm of the X chromosome (Xp) is responsible for the hallmark features of the TS cognitive phenotype. Careful clinical and molecular characterization of adult subjects missing part of Xp links the TS phenotype of impaired visual spatial/perceptual ability to specific distal Xp chromosome regions. We demonstrate that small, nonmosaic deletion of the distal short arm of the X chromosome in adult women is associated with the same hallmark cognitive profile seen in adult women with TS. Future studies will elucidate the cognitive deficits and the underlying etiology. These results should allow us to begin to design cognitive interventions that might lessen those deficits in the TS population.

TI	Modulation of eomes activity alters the size of the developing heart: implications for in utero cardiac gene therapy.
PG	842-55
AB	Congenital heart disease is the most prevalent cause of infant morbidity and mortality in developed countries. The mechanisms responsible for many specific types of congenital cardiac malformations are strongly associated with gene abnormalities. However, at this time no strategies for gene therapy of the various congenital heart malformations have been investigated. In the present studies we focus on Eomesodermin (Eomes), a T-box transcription factor expressed in developing vertebrate mesoderm. Although Eomes is required for early mesodermal patterning and differentiation, the role of Eomes in cardiac development is unknown. In the present studies we demonstrate that Eomes is expressed in the developing heart, with a pronounced myocardial distribution in the Xenopus ventricle during late cardiac development. Using either a conditional dominant-interfering approach (GR-Eomes--engrailed) or an Eomes-activating approach (GR-Eomes-VP16) we demonstrate that manipulating Eomes activity during late cardiac development can either suppress ventricular development (GR-Eomes-enR) or increase ventricular myocardial size (GR-Eomes-VP16). Thus, a potential gene therapy approach for treating both congenital ventricular hypoplasia (e.g., the hypoplastic left heart syndrome) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is hypothetically implicit from the present results.

TI	The Q223R polymorphism in LEPR is associated with obesity in Pacific Islanders.
PG	287-94
AB	Various Pacific Island populations have experienced a marked increase in the prevalence of obesity in past decades. This study examined the association of a promoter polymorphism of the leptin gene (LEP), G-2548A (rs7799039), and two non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms of the leptin receptor gene (LEPR), K109R (rs1137100) and Q223R (rs1137101), with body weight, body mass index (BMI) and obesity (BMI &gt; or = 30) in Pacific Islanders. A total of 745 Austronesian (AN)-speaking participants were analyzed after adjusting for age, gender, and population differences. The results revealed that carriers of the 223Q alleles of LEPR had significantly higher body weight (P = 0.0009) and BMI (P = 0.0022) than non-carriers (i.e., 223R homozygotes); furthermore, the 223Q carriers also had a signiWcantly higher risk of obesity in comparison to non-carriers (P = 0.0222). The other two polymorphisms, G-2548A and K109R, were associated with neither body weight, BMI, nor obesity. The 223Q allele was widely found among the AN-speaking study subjects, thus suggesting that the LEPR Q223R polymorphism is one of the factors contributing to the high prevalence of obesity in the Pacific Island populations.

TI	The association of SNPs in ADIPOQ, ADIPOR1, and ADIPOR2 with insulin sensitivity in a cohort of adolescents and their parents.
PG	21-8
AB	Few studies have examined the association of SNPs in the adiponectin (ADIPOQ) and adiponectin receptor 1 and 2 (ADIPOR1, ADIPOR2) genes with the euglycemic clamp, i.e. the gold standard measure of insulin sensitivity. The association of comprehensive tag SNPs in these genes with insulin sensitivity was examined in a cohort of adolescents and their parents. Probands and siblings (n=441, mean age=17.9 years) were recruited along with their parents (n=262, mean age=47.9 years). Typed SNPs included 21 SNPs in ADIPOQ, 7 SNPs in ADIPOR1, and 13 SNPs in ADIPOR2. Mixed model linear regression was used to test the association of SNPs with euglycemic-clamp derived insulin sensitivity. All analyses were stratified by race. After corrections to account for multiple testing and the linkage disequilibrium structure of the genes, one SNP in the ADIPOQ gene (rs822393) was significantly associated with insulin sensitivity in white subjects. In whites, six SNPs in ADIPOQ, one SNP in ADIPOR1 and one SNP in ADIPOR2 were associated with insulin sensitivity at the P&lt;0.05 level. In African Americans, two SNPs in ADIPOR1 were associated with insulin sensitivity at the P&lt;0.05 level. These results suggest that a variant in the ADIPOQ gene influences levels of insulin sensitivity and age may modify the effects of this variant. There are several other variants in ADIPOQ, ADIPOR1, and ADIPOR2 that may influence insulin sensitivity and these variants should be further investigated in other populations.

TI	Gender influences monoallelic expression of ATP10A in human brain.
PG	235-42
AB	Human chromosome 15q11-13 and the syntenic region of mouse chromosome 7 contain multiple imprinted genes necessary for proper neurodevelopment. Due to imprinting, paternal 15q11-13 deficiencies lead to Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) while maternal 15q11-13 deficiencies cause Angelman syndrome (AS). The mechanisms involved in parental imprinting of this locus are conserved between human and mouse, yet inconsistencies exist in reports of imprinting of the maternally expressed gene Atp10a/ATP10A. Excess maternal 15q11-13 dosage often leads to autism-spectrum disorder therefore further investigation to characterize the true imprinting status of ATP10A in humans was warranted. In this study, we examined allelic expression of ATP10A transcript in 16 control brain samples, and found that 10/16 exhibited biallelic expression while only 6/16 showed monoallelic expression. Contrary to the expectation for a maternally expressed imprinted gene, quantitative RT-PCR revealed significantly reduced ATP10A transcript in Prader-Willi syndrome brains with two maternal chromosomes due to uniparental disomy (PWS UPD). Furthermore, a PWS UPD brain sample with monoallelic ATP10A expression demonstrated that monoallelic expression can be independent of imprinting. Investigation of factors that may influence allelic ATP10A expression status revealed that gender has a major affect, as females were significantly more likely to have monoallelic ATP10A expression than males. Regulatory sequences were also examined, and a promoter polymorphism that disrupts binding of the transcription factor Sp1 also potentially contributes to allelic expression differences in females. Our results show that monoallelic expression of human ATP10A is variable in the population and is influenced by both gender and common genetic variation.

TI	Imprinting detection by extending a regression-based QTL analysis method.
PG	159-74
AB	We present an extension of a regression-based quantitative-trait linkage analysis method to incorporate parent-of-origin effects. We separately regressed total, paternal, and maternal IBD sharing on traits' squared sums and differences. We also developed a test for imprinting that indicates whether there is any difference between the paternal and maternal regression coefficients. Since this method treats the identity-by-descent information as the dependent variable that is conditioned on the trait, it can be readily applied to data from complex ascertainment processes. We performed a simulation study to examine the performance of the method. We found that when using empirical critical values, the method shows identical or higher power compared to existing methods for evaluation of parent-of-origin effect in linkage analysis of quantitative traits. Missing parental genotypes increase the type I error rate of the linkage test and decrease the power of the imprinting test. When the major gene has a low heritability, the power of the method decreases considerably, but the statistical tests still perform well. We also applied a permutation algorithm, which ensures the appropriate type I error rate for the test for imprinting. The method was applied to a data from a study of 6 body size related measures and 23 loci on chromosome 7 for 255 nuclear families. Multipoint identities-by-descent (IBD) were obtained using a modification of the SIMWALK 2 program. A parent-of-origin effect consistent with maternal imprinting was suggested at 99.67-111.26 Mb for body mass index, bioelectrical impedance analysis, waist circumference, and leptin concentration.

TI	The physical phenotype of girls and women with Turner syndrome is not X-imprinted.
PG	469-74
AB	Certain behavioral and metabolic aspects of Turner syndrome (TS) are attributed to X-chromosome genomic imprinting. To investigate the possible contribution of imprinting to the physical features of the TS phenotype in live-born individuals, we genotyped the single normal X-chromosome in subjects with TS who all underwent a comprehensive evaluation as part of the NIH genotype-phenotype protocol. All had physical examinations, auxological measurements and imaging of the renal and cardiovascular systems. Absolute height and height as a percent of predicted height was the same in X(M) (n = 56) and X(P) (n = 23) subjects that had reached final height and were not growth hormone treated. Interestingly, adult height was significantly correlated with maternal but not paternal heights in both X(M) and X(P) groups. Neck webbing was found in 35% of the X(M) (n = 133) and 22% of the X(P) (n = 50) groups (P = 0.11). Renal anomalies were present in 24% of X(M) and 25% of X(P) groups (P = 0.9). Bicuspid aortic valve was found in 26% of X(M) and 24% of X(P) groups (P = 0.83), and any cardiovascular anomaly (abnormal aortic valve, aortic coarctation, elongated transverse aortic arch, anomalous pulmonary venous connection, left superior vena cava) affected 55% of X(M) and 52% of X(P) groups. Thus, we found no evidence for X-linked genomic imprinting effects on stature or lymphatic, renal or cardiovascular development in TS. Our sample size was sufficient to exclude such effects within 95% confidence limits. We did demonstrate a selective maternal effect on final stature that was independent of X-chromosome origin, suggesting potential autosomal imprinting effects on growth revealed by X monosomy.

TI	A maternal hypomethylation syndrome presenting as transient neonatal diabetes mellitus.
PG	262-9
AB	The expression of imprinted genes is mediated by allele-specific epigenetic modification of genomic DNA and chromatin, including parent of origin-specific DNA methylation. Dysregulation of these genes causes a range of disorders affecting pre	and post-natal growth and neurological function. We investigated a cohort of 12 patients with transient neonatal diabetes whose disease was caused by loss of maternal methylation at the TNDM locus. We found that six of these patients showed a spectrum of methylation loss, mosaic with respect to the extent of the methylation loss, the tissues affected and the genetic loci involved. Five maternally methylated loci were affected, while one maternally methylated and two paternally methylated loci were spared. These patients had higher birth weight and were more phenotypically diverse than other TNDM patients with different aetiologies, presumably reflecting the influence of dysregulation of multiple imprinted genes. We propose the existence of a maternal hypomethylation syndrome, and therefore suggest that any patient with methylation loss at one maternally-methylated locus may also manifest methylation loss at other loci, potentially complicating or even confounding the clinical presentation.

TI	Epimutation of the TNDM locus and the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome centromeric locus in individuals with transient neonatal diabetes mellitus.
PG	179-84
AB	Transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM) is characterised by intra-uterine growth retardation, while Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is a clinically heterogeneous overgrowth syndrome. Both TNDM and BWS may be caused by aberrant loss of methylation (LOM) at imprinted loci on chromosomes 6q24 and 11p15.5 respectively. Here we describe two patients with a clinical diagnosis of TNDM caused by LOM at the maternally methylated imprinted domain on 6q24; in addition, these patients had LOM at the centromeric differentially methylated region of 11p15.5. This shows that imprinting anomalies can affect more than one imprinted locus and may alter the clinical presentation of imprinted disease.

TI	Mortality and cancer incidence in women with extra X chromosomes: a cohort study in Britain.
PG	255-60
AB	About one woman in 1,000 has an extra X chromosome, but such women have no recognised characteristic somatic features and little is known about their long-term health and cancer risks. We conducted a cohort study of mortality and cancer incidence in 542 women diagnosed with X polysomy at 25 cytogenetic centres in Britain since 1959. Fifty-nine deaths occurred during follow-up to mid-2004. Mortality was significantly raised (standardised mortality ratio (SMR) = 2.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9-3.2)), with excess deaths due particularly to cardiovascular disease (SMR = 2.5 (95% CI 1.5-3.8)) and respiratory disease (SMR = 4.0 (95% CI 1.7-7.9)). Risks of cancer incidence and cancer mortality overall were not raised, but there was significantly raised mortality from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (SMR = 10.4 (95% CI 1.3-37.6); based on 2 cases). The data indicate that mortality in women diagnosed with X polysomy is considerably raised. The raised risk of NHL is seen also in males with more than one X chromosome, and hence although unexpected and based on small numbers, it might indicate the action of a gene on the X chromosome, possibly in the pseudoautosomal region, that escapes X-inactivation.

TI	Bisulphite sequencing of the transient neonatal diabetes mellitus DMR facilitates a novel diagnostic test but reveals no methylation anomalies in patients of unknown aetiology.
PG	255-61
AB	Transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM) is associated with overexpression of an imprinted locus on chromosome 6q24; this locus contains a differentially methylated region (DMR) consisting of an imprinted CpG island that normally allows expression only from the paternal allele of genes under its control. Three types of abnormality involving 6q24 are known to cause TNDM: paternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 6 (pUPD6), an isolated methylation defect of the imprinted CpG island at chromosome 6q24 and a duplication of 6q24 of paternal origin. A fourth group of patients has no identifiable anomaly of 6q24. Bisulphite sequencing of the DMR has facilitated the development of a diagnostic test for TNDM based on ratiometric methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. We have applied this method to 45 cases of TNDM, including 12 with pUPD6, 11 with an isolated methylation mutation at 6q24, 16 with a duplication of 6q24 and six of unknown aetiology, together with 29 normal controls. All were correctly assigned. The method is therefore capable of detecting all known genetic causes of TNDM at 6q24, although pUPD6 and methylation mutation cases are not distinguished from one another. In addition, we have carried out bisulphite sequencing of the DMR to compare its methylation status between six TNDM patients with a known methylation mutation, six patients with no identifiable 6q24 mutation and six normal controls. Whereas methylation mutation patients showed a near-total absence of DNA methylation at the TNDM locus, the patients with no identified molecular anomaly showed no marked methylation variation from controls.

TI	Monozygous triplets discordant for transient neonatal diabetes mellitus and for imprinting of the TNDM differentially methylated region.
PG	398-401
AB	Transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM) is associated with paternal over-expression of an imprinted locus on chromosome 6q24, which contains one differentially methylated region (DMR); maternal demethylation at the DMR accounts for approximately 20% of cases. Here we report female monozygous triplets, two of whom have TNDM arising from loss of maternal methylation within the TNDM DMR.

TI	Relaxation of imprinted expression of ZAC and HYMAI in a patient with transient neonatal diabetes mellitus.
PG	139-44
AB	Transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM) is a rare disease believed to result from overexpression of a paternally expressed gene controlled by a differentially methylated CpG island on chromosome 6q24. Two genes partially overlap the island: the cell-cycle-control gene ZAC and the untranslated gene HYMAI, the function of which is currently unknown. Proof that either gene is involved in TNDM would require demonstration that imprinted expression is relaxed in TNDM patients; this has hitherto been lacking because of the rarity of the disease and the lack of imprinted expression in the lymphoblastoid cells that are generally the only resource available for study. Here, we show, for the first time, the aberrant expression of imprinted genes in a TNDM patient. In TNDM fibroblasts, the monoallelic expression of both ZAC and HYMAI is relaxed, providing strong supportive evidence that the presence of two unmethylated alleles of this locus is indeed associated with the inappropriate gene expression of neighbouring genes.

TI	Heterotrisomy, a significant contributing factor to ventricular septal defect associated with Down syndrome?
PG	476-82
AB	Down syndrome (DS; trisomy 21) is associated with a wide range of variable clinical features, one of the most common being congenital heart defects (CHD). We used molecular genetic techniques to study the inheritance of genes on chromosome 21 in children with DS and CHD. Polymorphic markers on the long arm of chromosome 21 were analysed in 99 families who had a child with DS. Of these, 60 children had a CHD and 39 children had no CHD. Heterotrisomy describes the inheritance of an allele from each of three different grandparents. In some cases heterotrisomy will involve the inheritance of three different alleles. Heterotrisomic regions were defined as those showing retention of non-disjoining parental heterozygosity at polymorphic loci in the non-disjoined chromosomes of children with DS. Using polymorphic non-coding markers, we identified a consistent 9.6-cM minimum region (D21S167-HMG14) of heterotrisomy in children with DS and ventricular septal defect (VSD). Comparing individuals with DS and VSD to all others with DS (those either with no CHD or with any other CHD combined) shows the individuals with DS and VSD to have significantly more non-reduction or heterotrisomy in this region (P=0.006, Fisher's exact test, two-tailed). We postulate that heterotrisomy for a gene or genes in this region is a contributing factor to the pathogenesis of VSD in trisomy 21 either through the presence of three different specific alleles or through the presence of specific combinations of alleles.

TI	Del(X)(p21.1) in a mother and two daughters: genotype-phenotype correlation of Turner features.
PG	306-10
AB	We report a mother and two daughters with partial Xp monosomy. Clinical assessment for Turner phenotype revealed that the three females manifested low-normal to mild short stature (-1.6 to approximately -2.3 SD) and variable degrees of skeletal features, such as cubitus valgus, short 4th matacarpals, and Madelung deformity, but no soft tissue or visceral anomalies or gonadal dysfunction. Cytogenetic studies for lymphocytes showed that the karyotype was 45,X[3]/46,X,del(X)(p21.1)[27] in the mother and non-mosaic 46,X,del(X)(p21.1) in the two daughters. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and microsatellite analyses for 19 loci/regions on the X chromosome demonstrated that the del(Xp) chromosome was missing SHOX and had the breakpoint between DMD and CYBB. The results are consistent with the recently proposed notion that haploinsufficiency of SHOX results in not only short stature, but also Turner skeletal features in association with maturational effects of gonadal estrogens. The lack of soft tissue or visceral anomalies suggests the presence of the putative lymphogenic gene on the del(Xp) chromosome; the preservation of ovarian function appears to be compatible with meiotic pairing failure being relatively mild.

TI	Isolated supravalvular aortic stenosis: functional haploinsufficiency of the elastin gene as a result of nonsense-mediated decay.
PG	577-88
AB	We have used single-strand conformation and heteroduplex analyses of genomic amplimers to identify point mutations within the elastin gene (ELN) in patients with non-syndromic supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) from a total of eight unrelated families. Six novel point mutations were identified. We have collected detailed clinical information on mutation carriers and demonstrated significant non-penetrance in some of the families. Together with the new mutations described here, 14 point mutations have been reported in SVAS patients, and 10 of these result in premature stop codons (PTCs). We have analyzed the expression of ELN alleles in skin fibroblasts from one SVAS patient and shown that PTC mutations indeed result in selective elimination of mutant transcripts. Inhibition of the nonsense-mediated decay mechanism by cycloheximide resulted in the stabilization of mutant elastin mRNA. Allelic inactivation by the ELN mutation in this patient led to an overall decrease of the steady state levels of elastin mRNA. Finally, we have demonstrated reduced synthesis and secretion of tropoelastin by skin fibroblasts from the same SVAS patient. We conclude that PTC mutations in ELN result in nonsense-mediated decay of mutant mRNA in this patient. Given the predominance of PTC mutations in SVAS, we suggest that functional haploinsufficiency may be a pathomechanism underlying most cases of non-syndromic SVAS.

TI	Seven ring (X) chromosomes lacking the XIST locus, six with an unexpectedly mild phenotype.
PG	93-100
AB	Small ring (X) chromosomes lacking the XIST gene at Xq13.2 have been associated with a severe phenotype that includes mental retardation, facial dysmorphism and congenital abnormalities. It has been hypothesised that the loss of XIST results in functional disomy for the sequences contained in the ring. We studied 47 females with a 45,X/46,r(X) karyotype and found seven to have an XIST-negative ring. Only one of the seven patients had the severe phenotype. The remaining six patients had physical phenotypes consistent with Turner syndrome. The rings were characterised cytogenetically and molecularly. The severe phenotype in one patient can be explained by the absence of XIST expression, the relatively large amount of Xp material in the ring and, possibly, the concomitant maternal uniparental isodisomy. We propose three explanations for the unexpectedly mild phenotypes in the remaining six patients; (1) the rings contained limited amounts of X-chromosome material, and sequences that, when functionally disomic, result in a severe phenotype were absent; (2) mosaicism resulting in the absence of the ring from tissues, such as the brain, which are important in the severe phenotype and (3) the presence of an inactive X in some tissues at some time, exemplified by the demonstration of XIST expression in one patient.

TI	Investigation of a cryptic interstitial duplication involving the Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome critical region.
PG	384-7
AB	A 3-year-old female referred with developmental delay, hypotonia and seizures was found to have a cryptic interstitial duplication of the Prader-Willi/Angelman critical region (PWACR). Her clinical features form part of a common phenotype characteristic of PWACR duplications including developmental delay, behavioural problems and speech difficulties. Microsatellite analysis showed that the duplication had arisen de novo, was maternal in origin and involved the entire 4-Mb PWACR between the common deletion breakpoints. The existence of cryptic rearrangements emphasises the need for molecular tests alongside conventional cytogenetics when investigating abnormalities involving this imprinted region.

TI	Molecular analysis of eight mutations in FBN1.
PG	587-97
AB	Mutations in the gene encoding extracellular glycoprotein fibrillin-1 (FBN1) cause Marfan syndrome (MFS) and other related connective tissue disorders. In this study, eight mutations have been detected in MFS patients by heteroduplex analysis. These comprise two missense mutations, C1835Y and C2258Y in calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like domains, two nonsense mutations, R1541X and R2394X in transforming growth factor beta1-binding protein-like domains, one splice site mutation, which has been detected previously, and three small insertions or deletions resulting in a frameshift. Fibroblast cells have been established from seven of the MFS patients and the biochemical effects of the mutations on fibrillin-1 synthesis and secretion assessed by pulse-chase analysis. Each cysteine mutation resulted in the delayed secretion of fibrillin-1 and both nonsense and frameshift mutations caused reduced levels of synthesis and/or deposition of fibrillin-1. Indirect immunofluorescence and rotary shadowing electron microscopy analysis of fibrillin microfibrils revealed no major differences between normal and patient samples. We discuss the relative merits of the biochemical techniques used in this study.

TI	Transmission disequilibrium and sequence variants at the leptin receptor gene in extremely obese German children and adolescents.
PG	540-6
AB	Genetic determinants of the degree of obesity and body fat distribution have been demonstrated by family studies. The heritability has been estimated to be in the range 0.2-0.7. Mutation leading to obesity in humans has been described for only two genes, one of them the leptin gene. The leptin gene codes for a cytokine secreted by fat cells that binds to the leptin receptor (Lep-R), which exerts some of its biological functions by expression in the brain. Hence, the Lep-R gene appears to be a promising candidate for the determination of obesity in humans. We isolated genomic DNA clones from the Lep-R gene region and identified a new polymorphic microsatellite marker (OBR-CA) within 80 kb of the translation start of Lep-R. We genotyped this and a second, intragenic microsatellite marker (D1S2852) in 130 nuclear families consisting of extremely obese children and adolescents and both parents. Using the most frequent parental allele of both markers, our analysis revealed a significant transmission disequilibrium for the 266-bp allele of D1S2852 (corrected P-value=0.042). No significant result was obtained with the most frequent allele of OBR-CA (corrected P-value=1.0). However, two rare alleles showed transmission disequilibrium and were subsequently used for constructing a haplotype with the 266-bp allele. This haplotype had a transmission rate of 80% (nominal P-value=0.02). In order to identify the underlying mutation, we sequenced all coding exons of Lep-R and the partially overlapping gene encoding the obese receptor gene-related protein (ob-rgrp) in individuals carrying this haplotype. We found one new mutation (Ser675Thr) in the Lep-R gene in one proband and several other mutations known to be not associated with obesity in other study groups. As this new mutation cannot explain our positive linkage result, the transmission disequilibrium of the 266-bp allele and the high transmission rate of the identified haplotype point towards a mutation in close proximity to marker D1S2852.

TI	Evaluation of methylation analysis for diagnostic testing in 258 referrals suspected of Prader-Willi or Angelman syndromes.
PG	535-9
AB	Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) are distinct neurodevelopmental disorders with interrelated genetic mechanisms because genomic imprinting within the chromosome 15q11-13 region affects both the PWS and the AS locus. Methylation analysis is one method of distinguishing between the maternally and paternally inherited chromosome 15. Here we present clinical and molecular data on a large series of 258 referred patients, evaluated with methylation analysis: 115 with suspected PWS and 143 with suspected AS. In these patients, the clinical phenotype was graded into three groups: classical (group 1); not classical but possible (group 2); not classical and unlikely (group 3). For PWS, a fourth group consisted of hypotonic babies. DNA methylation analysis confirmed the diagnosis of PWS in 30 patients (26%) and AS in 28 patients (20%). For 21 PWS patients the mechanism was established: 15 had deletions, 4 had uniparental disomy (UPD) and 2 a presumed imprinting defect. Clinically all those with an abnormal methylation pattern had the classical phenotype and none of those with a normal methylation pattern had classical PWS. For 23 AS patients in whom a mechanism was established, 17 had a deletion, 3 had UPD and 3 had a presumed imprinting defect. There was greater clinical overlap in AS, with 26 classical AS patients having a normal methylation pattern while an abnormal methylation pattern was seen in one patient from group 2. In addition, there were a further 40 patients with a normal methylation pattern in whom AS was still a possible diagnosis. Our conclusion is that methylation analysis provides an excellent screening test for both syndromes, providing approximately 99% diagnosis for PWS and for AS, a 75% diagnostic rate, supplemented for the remaining 25% with an essential basic starting point to further investigations.

PG	507-16
AB	We have undertaken a clinical and molecular study of 25 females with deletions of the short arm of the X chromosome. We have determined the deletion breakpoints, the parental origin and the activation status of the deleted X chromosomes. Genotype-phenotype correlations suggest that the presence of a single copy of the DFFRX gene, previously postulated as a gene involved in the ovarian failure seen in Turner syndrome, may be compatible with normal ovarian function, and that there may be a gene for Turner-like features located in distal Xp22.3.

TI	Molecular and clinical study of 183 patients with conotruncal anomaly face syndrome.
PG	70-80
AB	To investigate molecular and clinical aspects of conotruncal anomaly face (CAF), we studied the correlation between deletion size and phenotype and the mode of inheritance in 183 conotruncal anomaly face syndrome (CAFS) patients. Hemizygosity for a region of 22ql1.2 was found in 180 (98%) of the patients with CAFS by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using the N25(D22S75) DiGeorge critical region (DGCR) probe. No hemizygosity was found in three (2%) of the patients with CAFS by FISH using nine DiGeorge critical region probes and a SD1OP1 probe (DGA II locus). None of these three patients had mental retardation and just one had nasal intonation, which was observed in almost all of the 180 CAFS patients who carried deletions (mental retardation, 92%; nasal voice, 88%). Nineteen of 143 families (13%) had familial CAFS and 16 affected parents (84%) were mothers. Although only two of the affected parents had cardiovascular anomalies, the deletion size in the 16 affected parents and their affected family members, who were studied by FISH analysis, was the same. It indicates that extragenic factors may play a role in the genesis of phenotypic variability, especially in patients with cardiovascular anomalies. No familial cases were found among CAFS patients with absent thymus/DiGeorge anomaly (DGA). Also, in all 18 CAFS patients with completely absent thymus/DGA and all 6 CAFS patients with schizophrenia, it was revealed that the deletion was longer distally. A study of the origin of the deletion using microsatellite analyses in 48 de novo patients showed that in 65% of CAFS patients it was maternal, while in 64% of DGA patients it was paternal. The findings of this study indicated that CAF was almost always associated with the deletion of 22ql1.2. As well as the major features of the syndrome, other notable extracardiac anomalies were found to be susceptibility to infection, schizophrenia, atrophy or dysmorphism of the brain, thrombocytopenia, short stature, facial palsy, anal atresia, and mild limb abnormalities.

TI	Relaxation of imprinting in Prader-Willi syndrome.
PG	694-701
AB	We describe two Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) patients who exhibit maternal uniparental disomy (UPD) of chromosome 15 and unusual patterns of gene expression and DNA replication. Both were diagnosed during infancy as having PWS; however, their growth and development were atypical compared with others with this condition. Weight was below normal in the first patient, and height and development were within normal limits in the second individual. Hyperphagia and polyphagia were not evident in either patient. Genotypes at multiple genomic loci, allele-specific methylation, gene expression, and DNA replication were analyzed at D15S9 [ZNF127], D15S63 [PW71], SNRPN, PAR5, IPW, and D15S10 in these patients. The maternal imprint (based on the absence of gene expression, synchronous replication, and methylation of both alleles) was retained at SNRPN in these patients, as is the case in others with UPD. By contrast, cells from the first individual expressed PAR5 and ZNF127, whereas the second expressed a single IPW allele. Asynchronous DNA replication was observed in both patients at all loci, except SNRPN. These findings show that a subset of imprinted genes can be transcribed in some PWS patients with maternal UPD and that asynchronous DNA replication is coordinated with this pattern of gene expression. Relaxed imprinting in these patients is consistent with their milder phenotype.

TI	X chromosome inactivation and micronuclei in normal and Turner individuals.
PG	624-8
AB	Studies on aneuploidy have shown that the X is the most frequently lost chromosome in females, and that the number of X chromosome-positive micronuclei increases with age in women. Recently, we showed that the inactive X chromosome is incorporated preferentially in micronuclei. The objectives of the current study were, firstly, to determine the incidence of X chromosome incorporation into micronuclei in males and, secondly, to determine the incidence of X chromosome incorporation into micronuclei of females with Turner syndrome. Blood samples were obtained from 18 male newborns and 35 normal adult males ranging in age from 22 to 79 years and from seven women with non-mosaic Turner syndrome aged 11-39 years. Isolated lymphocytes were cultured in the presence of cytochalasin B and 2000 binucleated cells per subject were scored for micronuclei. Cells were then hybridized with the biotinylated X centromere-specific probe, pBamX7, and visualized with fluorescein-conjugated avidin. All micronucleated cells were relocated and evaluated for the presence or absence of the X chromosome. Of the 335 micronuclei observed, 6.6% (22/335) contained an X chromosome. Analysis of variance shows a statistically significant increase, for both males and Turner females, in the number of X chromosome-positive micronuclei with age (P &lt; 0.001). These data also show that the X chromosome is included in micronuclei from males more often than would be expected by chance (P &lt; 0.005; chi 2 analysis, 15 df). Here we show that there is a tenfold difference in the frequency of X chromosome-positive micronuclei in 46,XX females compared to 46,XY males and 45,X females, providing further support to our previous finding that the X chromosome in micronuclei is the inactive chromosome.

TI	Evidence of major genes effects on serum homocysteine and fibrinogen levels, and premature ischemic heart disease in Italian extended families.
PG	50-60
AB	OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of novel genetic factors on plasma levels of total homocysteine (tHcy) and fibrinogen (FIB). As tHcy and FIB have been consistently associated to increased risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD) and acute myocardial infarction (MI) also genes-trait-MI mediational effects were tested. METHODS: A complex segregation analysis, and a mediation analysis of a highly selected group of 44 extended families (302 subjects), each including at least one member with fatal premature (&lt;50 years) IHD were carried out. RESULTS: tHcy and FIB levels turned out to be influenced by at least two major genes. A significant tHcy latent class-MI association (OR = 3.24; 95% CI, 1.37 to 7.68), and a non-significant tHcy plasma level-MI association (OR = 1.65 per 1 = log 10 mumol/l, 95% CI, 0.56 to 4.81) were estimated, suggesting a direct influence of the homocysteine major gene as suppressor of plasma tHcy levels effect. In contrast, FIB latent class-MI association (OR = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.31 to 3.05) and FIB level-MI association (OR = 1.32 per 1 = 70 g/l; 95% CI, 0.88 to 2.00) were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: These data provide evidence for a major latent gene effect influencing variation in tHcy plasma levels, which is independent on C677T MTHFR polymorphism, and significantly affecting the risk of MI.

TI	Candidate-gene association study of mothers with pre-eclampsia, and their infants, analyzing 775 SNPs in 190 genes.
PG	1-16
AB	Pre-eclampsia (PE) affects 5-7% of pregnancies in the US, and is a leading cause of maternal death and perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. To identify genes with a role in PE, we conducted a large-scale association study evaluating 775 SNPs in 190 candidate genes selected for a potential role in obstetrical complications. SNP discovery was performed by DNA sequencing, and genotyping was carried out in a high-throughput facility using the MassARRAY(TM) System. Women with PE (n = 394) and their offspring (n = 324) were compared with control women (n = 602) and their offspring (n = 631) from the same hospital-based population. Haplotypes were estimated for each gene using the EM algorithm, and empirical p values were obtained for a logistic regression-based score test, adjusted for significant covariates. An interaction model between maternal and offspring genotypes was also evaluated. The most significant findings for association with PE were COL1A1 (p = 0.0011) and IL1A (p = 0.0014) for the maternal genotype, and PLAUR (p = 0.0008) for the offspring genotype. Common candidate genes for PE, including MTHFR and NOS3, were not significantly associated with PE. For the interaction model, SNPs within IGF1 (p = 0.0035) and IL4R (p = 0.0036) gave the most significant results. This study is one of the most comprehensive genetic association studies of PE to date, including an evaluation of offspring genotypes that have rarely been considered in previous studies. Although we did not identify statistically significant evidence of association for any of the candidate loci evaluated here after adjusting for multiple testing using the false discovery rate, additional compelling evidence exists, including multiple SNPs with nominally significant p values in COL1A1 and the IL1A region, and previous reports of association for IL1A, to support continued interest in these genes as candidates for PE. Identification of the genetic regulators of PE may have broader implications, since women with PE are at increased risk of death from cardiovascular diseases later in life.

TI	Family-based analysis of tumor necrosis factor and lymphotoxin-alpha tag polymorphisms with type 1 diabetes in the population of South Croatia.
PG	195-9
AB	Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and lymphotoxin-alpha (LTA) are cytokines with a wide range of inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease characterized by destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association of polymorphisms in the TNF/LTA gene region with susceptibility to type 1 diabetes. We investigated 11 TNF/LTA tag polymorphisms, designed to capture the majority of common variation in the region, in 160 trio families from South Croatia. We observed overtransmission of alleles from parents to affected child at five variants: (rs909253, allele C, p = 1.2x10(-4); rs1041981, allele A, p = 1.1x10(-4); rs1800629 (G-308A), allele A, p = 1.2x10(-4); rs361525 (G-238A), allele G, p = 8.2x10(-3) and rs3093668, allele G, p = 0.014). We also identified overtransmission of the rs1800629(G-308A)-rs361525(G-238A) A-G haplotype, p = 2.384x10(-5). The present study found an association of the TNF/LTA gene region with type 1 diabetes. A careful assessment of TNF/LTA variants adjusted for linkage disequilibrium with HLA loci is needed to further clarify the role of these genes in type 1 diabetes susceptibility in the population of South Croatia.

TI	Polymorphisms of TNF microsatellite marker a and HLA-DR-DQ in diabetes mellitus-a study in 609 Swedish subjects.
PG	527-34
AB	We explored the importance of the genetic markers microsatellite TNFa, HLA-DR3-DQ2, and DR4-DQ8 in diabetes mellitus. The studied groups comprised autoimmune type 1 (n = 63), nonautoimmune type 1 (n = 35), latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA; n = 54), and nonautoimmune type 2 (n = 340) and these patients were compared to 117 healthy controls. HLA genotyping was done with polymerase chain reaction and sequence-specific oligonucleotides. TNFa microsatellites were determined with polymerase chain reaction and fragment size determination. Univariate analysis of these genetic risk factors demonstrated that homozygosity for TNFa2/2 was a significant risk factor for autoimmune type 1 diabetes (odds ratio (OR) = 5.82; 95% confidence interval (95%CI) 1.97-17.2), for autoimmune negative type 1 diabetes (OR = 4.63; 95%CI 1.32-16.2), and for LADA (OR = 3.90; 95%CI 1.21-12.5). Moreover, heterozygosity for HLA-DR3-DQ2/DR4-DQ8 was an important risk factor for autoimmune type 1 diabetes (OR = 16.4; 95%CI 3.60-75) as was DR4-DQ8/x (OR = 2.52; 95%CI 1.27-4.98). Heterozygosity for HLA-DR3-DQ2/DR4-DQ8 was a risk factor also for LADA (OR = 10.0; 95%CI 2.05-48.9). Neither HLA-DR3-DQ2 nor DR4-DQ8 were risk factors for nonautoimmune type 1 or type 2 diabetes. We concluded that heterozygosity for DR3-DQ2/DR4-DQ8 and to some extent homozygosity for TNFa2/2 were risk factors for autoimmune diabetes irrespective of the clinical classification.

TI	Linkage disequilibrium with predisposing DR3 haplotypes accounts for apparent effects of tumor necrosis factor and lymphotoxin-alpha polymorphisms on type 1 diabetes susceptibility.
PG	999-1004
AB	Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and lymphotoxin alpha (LT-alpha) are immunomodulators that have been hypothesized to contribute to susceptibility to type 1 diabetes (T1D). Several polymorphisms in the TNF and LT-alpha loci have been extensively studied for T1D association, with conflicting reports. In this study, we examined two TNF variants and one LT-alpha variant for T1D association in 283 Caucasian, multiplex T1D families for which complete human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotyping data are available. Initially, association with T1D was seen for LT-alpha A1069G (intron A, p=0.011, rs909253) and TNF G(-308)A (p&lt;1x10(-5), rs1800629), but no association was observed for TNF G(-238)A (rs361525). After adjusting the data for linkage disequilibrium (LD) with DRB1-DQB1 haplotypes, however, only one polymorphism, TNF G(-238)A showed significant association with T1D (p&lt;0.006). When HLA-DR3 haplotypes were examined, the A allele of TNF G(-238)A was significantly overtransmitted to affected offspring (p&lt;0.009). Including HLA-B data in the analysis revealed that TNF (-238)A is present exclusively on DR3 haplotypes that also carry HLA-B18. Transmission proportion of B18-DR3 haplotypes did not differ between those with TNF (-238)A and those with TNF (-238)G. Thus, variation at TNF does not affect the T1D risk for B18-DR3 haplotypes, and the apparent association of TNF(-238)A with T1D may simply reflect its presence on a high-risk haplotype.

TI	Influence of TNF microsatellite polymorphisms (TNFa) on age-at-onset of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
PG	974-8
AB	The TNF-alpha gene is located in the HLA region and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus (IDDM). We investigated the frequency of TNFa microsatellite alleles in 76 young-onset IDDM patients, 65 adult-onset IDDM patients, and 90 control subjects. We also examined the association of these TNFa alleles with HLA-DRB1 alleles, HLA-class I alleles, and TNF-alpha production. The frequency of the TNFa2 and TNFa9 alleles was increased in the young-onset IDDM patients compared to control subjects, but the increased frequency of TNFa2 was not significant after the correction for the number of comparisons was made. We did not find any association of TNFa2 or TNFa9 with any of the HLA-DRB1 alleles. In contrast, the frequency of the TNFa13 allele was decreased in both the young-onset and the adult-onset IDDM patients compared to the control subjects, but the difference lost significance after the correction was made in the adult-onset IDDM. The TNFa13 allele was strongly associated with DRB1*1502. Patients with TNFa2 or TNFa9 had greater TNF-alpha production, while those positive for TNFa13 had lower TNF-alpha production than patients with non-TNFa2, a9, and a13 alleles. These results suggest that TNFa polymorphisms are associated with age-at-onset of IDDM and influence the inflammatory process of pancreatic beta cell destruction in the development of IDDM.

TI	Ancestral paternal genotype controls body weight and food intake for multiple generations.
PG	4134-44
AB	Current treatments have largely failed to slow the rapidly increasing world-wide prevalence of obesity and its co-morbidities. Despite a strong genetic contribution to obesity (40-70%), only a small percentage of heritability is explained with current knowledge of monogenic abnormalities, common sequence variants and conventional modes of inheritance. Epigenetic effects are rarely tested in humans because of difficulties arranging studies that distinguish conventional and transgenerational inheritance while simultaneously controlling environmental factors and learned behaviors. However, growing evidence from model organisms implicates genetic and environmental factors in one generation that affect phenotypes in subsequent generations. In this report, we provide the first evidence for paternal transgenerational genetic effects on body weight and food intake. This test focused on the obesity-resistant 6C2d congenic strain, which carries the Obrq2a(A/J) allele on an otherwise C57BL/6J background. Various crosses between 6C2d and the control C57BL/6J strain showed that the Obrq2a(A/J) allele in the paternal or grandpaternal generation was sufficient to inhibit diet-induced obesity and reduce food intake in the normally obesity-susceptible, high food intake C57BL/6J strain. These obesity-resistant and reduced food intake phenotypes were transmitted through the paternal lineage but not the maternal lineage with equal strength for at least two generations. Eliminating social interaction between the father and both his offspring and the pregnant dam did not significantly affect food intake levels, demonstrating that the phenotype is transmitted through the male germline rather than through social interactions. Persistence of these phenotypes across multiple generations raises the possibility that transgenerational genetic effects contribute to current metabolic conditions.

TI	Genome-wide association study of homocysteine levels in Filipinos provides evidence for CPS1 in women and a stronger MTHFR effect in young adults.
PG	2050-8
AB	Plasma homocysteine (Hcy) level is associated with cardiovascular disease and may play an etiologic role in vascular damage, a precursor for atherosclerosis. We performed a genome-wide association study for Hcy in 1786 unrelated Filipino women from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey (CLHNS). The most strongly associated single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs7422339, P = 4.7 x 10(-13)) encodes Thr1405Asn in the gene CPS1 and explained 3.0% of variation in the Hcy level. The widely studied MTHFR C677T SNP (rs1801133) was also highly significant (P = 8.7 x 10(-10)) and explained 1.6% of the trait variation. We also genotyped these two SNPs in 1679 CLHNS young adult offspring. The MTHFR C677T SNP was strongly associated with Hcy (P = 1.9 x 10(-26)) and explained approximately 5.1% of the variation in the offspring. In contrast, the CPS1 variant was significant only in females (P = 0.11 in all; P = 0.0087 in females). Combined analysis of all samples confirmed that the MTHFR variant was more strongly associated with Hcy in the offspring (interaction P = 1.2 x 10(-5)). Furthermore, although there was evidence for a positive synergistic effect between the CPS1 and MTHFR SNPs in the offspring (interaction P = 0.0046), there was no significant evidence for an interaction in the mothers (P = 0.55). These data confirm a recent finding that CPS1 is a locus influencing Hcy levels in women and suggest that genetic effects on Hcy may differ across developmental stages.

TI	DNA methylation and gene expression differences in children conceived in vitro or in vivo.
PG	3769-78
AB	Epidemiological data indicate that children conceived in vitro have a greater relative risk of low birth-weight, major and minor birth defects, and rare disorders involving imprinted genes, suggesting that epigenetic changes may be associated with assisted reproduction. We examined DNA methylation at more than 700 genes (1536 CpG sites) in placenta and cord blood and measured gene expression levels of a subset of genes that differed in methylation levels between children conceived in vitro versus in vivo. Our results suggest that in vitro conception is associated with lower mean methylation at CpG sites in placenta and higher mean methylation at CpG sites in cord blood. We also find that in vitro conception-associated DNA methylation differences are associated with gene expression differences at both imprinted and non-imprinted genes. The range of inter-individual variation in gene expression of the in vitro and in vivo groups overlaps substantially but some individuals from the in vitro group differ from the in vivo group mean by more than two standard deviations. Several of the genes whose expression differs between the two groups have been implicated in chronic metabolic disorders, such as obesity and type II diabetes. These findings suggest that there may be epigenetic differences in the gametes or early embryos derived from couples undergoing treatment for infertility. Alternatively, assisted reproduction technology may have an effect on global patterns of DNA methylation and gene expression. In either case, these differences or changes may affect long-term patterns of gene expression.

TI	15q11-13 GABAA receptor genes are normally biallelically expressed in brain yet are subject to epigenetic dysregulation in autism-spectrum disorders.
PG	691-703
AB	Human chromosome 15q11-13 is a complex locus containing imprinted genes as well as a cluster of three GABA(A) receptor subunit (GABR) genes-GABRB3, GABRA5 and GABRG3. Deletion or duplication of 15q11-13 GABR genes occurs in multiple human neurodevelopmental disorders including Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), Angelman syndrome (AS) and autism. GABRB3 protein expression is also reduced in Rett syndrome (RTT), caused by mutations in MECP2 on Xq28. Although Gabrb3 is biallelically expressed in mouse brain, conflicting data exist regarding the imprinting status of the 15q11-13 GABR genes in humans. Using coding single nucleotide polymorphisms we show that all three GABR genes are biallelically expressed in 21 control brain samples, demonstrating that these genes are not imprinted in normal human cortex. Interestingly, four of eight autism and one of five RTT brain samples showed monoallelic or highly skewed allelic expression of one or more GABR gene, suggesting that epigenetic dysregulation of these genes is common to both disorders. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis of PWS and AS samples with paternal and maternal 15q11-13 deletions revealed a paternal expression bias of GABRB3, while RTT brain samples showed a significant reduction in GABRB3 and UBE3A. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and bisulfite sequencing in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells demonstrated that MeCP2 binds to methylated CpG sites within GABRB3. Our previous studies demonstrated that homologous 15q11-13 pairing in neurons was dependent on MeCP2 and was disrupted in RTT and autism cortex. Combined, these results suggest that MeCP2 acts as a chromatin organizer for optimal expression of both alleles of GABRB3 in neurons.

TI	A human imprinting centre demonstrates conserved acquisition but diverged maintenance of imprinting in a mouse model for Angelman syndrome imprinting defects.
PG	393-404
AB	Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) are caused by the loss of imprinted gene expression from chromosome 15q11-q13. Imprinted gene expression in the region is regulated by a bipartite imprinting centre (IC), comprising the PWS-IC and the AS-IC. The PWS-IC is a positive regulatory element required for bidirectional activation of a number of paternally expressed genes. The function of the AS-IC appears to be to suppress PWS-IC function on the maternal chromosome through a methylation imprint acquired during female gametogenesis. Here we have placed the entire mouse locus under the control of a human PWS-IC by targeted replacement of the mouse PWS-IC with the equivalent human region. Paternal inheritance of the human PWS-IC demonstrates for the first time that a positive regulatory element in the PWS-IC has diverged. These mice show postnatal lethality and growth deficiency, phenotypes not previously attributed directly to the affected genes. Following maternal inheritance, the human PWS-IC is able to acquire a methylation imprint in mouse oocytes, suggesting that acquisition of the methylation imprint is conserved. However, the imprint is lost in somatic cells, showing that maintenance has diverged. This maternal imprinting defect results in expression of maternal Ube3a-as and repression of Ube3a in cis, providing evidence that Ube3a is regulated by its antisense and creating the first reported mouse model for AS imprinting defects.

TI	X-linked genes and mental functioning.
PG	R27-32
AB	The X-chromosome has played a crucial role in the development of sexually selected characteristics for over 300 million years. During that time it has accumulated a disproportionate number of genes concerned with mental functions. Evidence is emerging, from studies of both humans and mice, for a general influence upon intelligence (as indicated by the large number of X-linked mental retardation syndromes). In addition, there is evidence for relatively specific effects of X-linked genes on social-cognition and emotional regulation. Sexually dimorphic processes could be influenced by several mechanisms. First, a small number of X-linked genes are apparently expressed differently in male and female brains in mouse models. Secondly, many human X-linked genes outside the X-Y pairing pseudoautosomal regions escape X-inactivation. Dosage differences in the expression of such genes (which might comprise at least 20% of the total) are likely to play an important role in male-female neural differentiation. To date, little is known about the process but clues can be gleaned from the study of X-monosomic females who are haploinsufficient for expression of all non-inactivated genes relative to 46,XX females. Finally, from studies of both X-monosomic humans (45,X) and mice (39,X), we are learning more about the influences of X-linked imprinted genes upon brain structure and function. Surprising specificity of effects has been described in both species, and identification of candidate genes cannot now be far off.

TI	Variation in USF1 shows haplotype effects, gene : gene and gene : environment associations with glucose and lipid parameters in the European Atherosclerosis Research Study II.
PG	1587-97
AB	Upstream stimulatory factor 1 (USF 1), is a transcription factor controlling expression of several genes involved in lipid and glucose homeostasis and co-localizes with familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) and type 2 diabetes on chromosome 1q22-23. We sequenced USF1 in 24 UK FCHL probands, but found no rare or common cSNPs. Three common intronic single nucleotide ploymorphisms (SNP), 306A&gt;G, 475C&gt;T and 1748C&gt;T, were identified and their association was examined with fasting and postprandial lipids and after an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in the European Atherosclerosis Research Study II offspring study. There were no significant differences in allelic frequencies of the SNPs between cases and controls. Individually none of the SNPs showed significant associations with any parameter. In haplotype analysis, compared with other haplotypes, 475C/1748T showed significantly higher and 475T/1748T showed lower peak glucose (P=0.004 and 0.07, respectively) during the OGTT. There was significant case-control heterogeneity in the interaction of genotype with body mass index, on fasting low density lipoprotein with 306A&gt;G and 1748C&gt;T, and on borderline significance with fasting glucose with 475C&gt;T (P=0.002, 0.0007 and 0.015, respectively). Furthermore, 475C&gt;T showed interaction with both HSL-60C&gt;G (case-control heterogeneity P=0.0002) on AUC TG and APOC3 -482C&gt;T on plasma apoE levels (P=0.0012). Thus, in these healthy young men, variation in USF1 was the influencing feature of both glucose and lipid homeostasis showing case-control heterogeneity.

TI	Williams-Beuren syndrome: a challenge for genotype-phenotype correlations.
PG	R229-37
AB	Many human chromosomal abnormality syndromes include specific cognitive and behavioural components. Children with Prader-Willi syndrome lack a paternally derived copy of the proximal long arm of chromosome 15, and eat uncontrollably; in Angelman syndrome lack of a maternal contribution of 15q11-q13 results in absence of speech, frequent smiling and episodes of paroxysmal laughter; deletions on 22q11 can be associated with obsessive behaviour and schizophrenia. The neurodevelopmental disorder Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS), is caused by a microdeletion at 7q11.23 and provides us with one of the most convincing models of a relationship that links genes with human cognition and behaviour. The hypothesis is that deletion of one or a series of genes causes neurodevelopmental abnormalities that manifest as the fractionation of mental abilities typical of WBS. Detailed molecular characterization of the deletion alongside well-defined cognitive profiling in WBS provides a unique opportunity to investigate the neuromolecular basis of complex cognitive behaviour, and develop integrated approaches to study gene function and genotype-phenotype correlations.

TI	Somatic mosaicism for maternal uniparental disomy 15 in a girl with Prader-Willi syndrome: confirmation by cell cloning and identification of candidate downstream genes.
PG	2723-32
AB	Although uniparental disomy often results from the postzygotic rescue of a meiotic non-disjunction event, mosaicism is usually confined to the placenta. We describe a girl with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) who is mosaic for normal cells and cells with maternal uniparental disomy 15 [upd(15)mat] in blood and skin. Somatic mosaicism was confirmed by cloning and genotyping of skin fibroblasts. X inactivation studies indicated that upd occurred prior to X inactivation. RNA samples from the cloned cells were used in DNA microarray experiments to study the effect of upd(15)mat on the gene expression pattern of fibroblasts. Proof of principle was obtained by detecting several chromosome 15 genes known to be imprinted. We did not obtain any evidence for novel 15q genes showing imprinted expression in fibroblasts. Differentially expressed genes on other chromosomes are candidates for downstream genes regulated by an imprinted gene and may play a role in the pathogenesis of PWS. The finding of strongly reduced mRNA levels in upd(15)mat cells of the gene encoding secretogranin II (SCG2), which is a precursor of the dopamine releasing factor secretoneurin, raises the question whether hyperphagia in patients with PWS might be due to a defect in dopamine-modulated food reward circuits.

PG	1227-37
AB	ALK-1 (activin receptor-like kinase-1), a type I receptor of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta superfamily, is the gene mutated in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 2 (HHT2) while endoglin is mutated in HHT1. Using a novel polyclonal antibody to ALK-1, we measured ALK-1 expression on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) of newborns from HHT families whose affected members had normal endoglin levels. ALK-1 levels were specifically reduced in three HUVEC with ALK-1 missense mutant codons, and normal in two newborns not carrying the missense mutations present in the clinically affected relatives. Levels were also normal in a HUVEC with deletion of S232 in the ATP binding site of ALK-1. Thus HHT2 appears to be associated with a loss of function of the mutant allele due to a reduction in either protein level or activity. We also report three new ALK-1 missense mutations leading to G48E/A49P, C344Y and E407D substitutions. In COS-1 transfected cells, ALK-1 was found in the TGF-beta1 and -beta3 receptor complexes in association with endoglin and TbetaRII, but not in activin receptor complexes containing endoglin. In HUVEC, ALK-1 was not detectable in the TGF-beta1 or -beta3 receptor complexes. However, in the absence of ligand, ALK-1 and endoglin interactions were observed by immunoprecipitation/western blot in HUVEC from normal as well as HHT1 and HHT2 patients. Our data suggest a transient association between these two proteins of the TGF-beta superfamily, both required at a critical level to ensure vessel wall integrity.

TI	An imprinted locus associated with transient neonatal diabetes mellitus.
PG	589-96
AB	Recently, we reported the localization of a gene for transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM), a rare form of childhood diabetes, to an approximately 5.4 Mb region of chromosome 6q24. We have also shown that TNDM is associated with both paternal uniparental disomy (UPD) of chromosome 6 and paternal duplications of the critical region. The sequencing of P1-derived artificial chromosome clones from within the region of interest has allowed us to further localize the gene and to investigate the methylation status of the region. The gene is now known to reside in a 300-400 kb region of 6q24 which contains several CpG islands. At one island we have demonstrated differential DNA methylation between patients with paternal UPD of chromosome 6 and normal controls. In addition, two patients with TNDM, in whom neither paternal UPD of chromosome 6 nor duplication of 6q24 have been found, show a DNA methylation pattern identical to that of patients with paternal UPD of chromosome 6. Control individuals show a hemizygous methylation pattern. These results show that TNDM can be associated with a methylation change and identify a novel methylation imprint on chromosome 6 associated with TNDM.

TI	The cell cycle control gene ZAC/PLAGL1 is imprinted--a strong candidate gene for transient neonatal diabetes.
PG	453-60
AB	We describe a screen for new imprinted human genes, and the identification in this way of ZAC (zinc finger protein which regulates apoptosis and cell cycle arrest)/ PLAGL1 (pleomorphicadenoma of the salivary gland gene like 1) as a strong candidate gene for transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM). To screen for imprinted genes, we compared parthenogenetic DNA from the chimeric patient FD and androgenetic DNA from hydatidiform mole, using restriction landmark genome scanning for methylation. This resulted in identification of two novel imprinted loci, one of which (NV149) we mapped to the TNDM region of 6q24. From analysis of the corresponding genomic region, it was determined that NV149 lies approximately 60 kb upstream of the ZAC / PLAGL1 gene. RT-PCR analysis was used to confirm that this ZAC / PLAGL1 is expressed only from the paternal allele in a variety of tissues. TNDM is known to result from upregulation of a paternally expressed gene on chromosome 6q24. The paternal expression, map position and known biological properties of ZAC / PLAGL1 make it highly likely that it is the TNDM gene. In particular, ZAC / PLAGL1 is a transcriptional regulator of the type 1 receptor for pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide, which is the most potent known insulin secretagog and an important mediator of autocrine control of insulin secretion in the pancreatic islet.

TI	Coats' disease of the retina (unilateral retinal telangiectasis) caused by somatic mutation in the NDP gene: a role for norrin in retinal angiogenesis.
PG	2031-5
AB	Coats' disease is characterized by abnormal retinal vascular development (so-called 'retinal telangiectasis') which results in massive intraretinal and subretinal lipid accumulation (exudative retinal detachment). The classical form of Coats' disease is almost invariably isolated, unilateral and seen in males. A female with a unilateral variant of Coats' disease gave birth to a son affected by Norrie disease. Both carried a missense mutation within the NDP gene on chromosome Xp11.2. Subsequently analysis of the retinas of nine enucleated eyes from males with Coats' disease demonstrated in one a somatic mutation in the NDP gene which was not present within non-retinal tissue. We suggest that Coats' telangiectasis is secondary to somatic mutation in the NDP gene which results in a deficiency of norrin (the protein product of the NDP gene) within the developing retina. This supports recent observations that the protein is critical for normal retinal vasculogenesis.

TI	A novel imprinted gene, encoding a RING zinc-finger protein, and overlapping antisense transcript in the Prader-Willi syndrome critical region.
PG	783-93
AB	We describe a complex imprinted locus in chromosome 15q11-q13 that encodes two genes, ZNF127 and ZNF127AS. The ZNF127 gene encodes a protein with a RING (C3HC4) zinc-finger and multiple C3H zinc-finger motifs, the former being closely related to a protein from variola major virus, the smallpox etiological agent. These motifs allow prediction of ZNF127 function as a ribonucleoprotein. The intronless ZNF127 gene is expressed ubiquitously, but the entire coding sequence and 5' CpG island overlaps a second gene, ZNF127AS, that is transcribed from the antisense strand with a different transcript size and pattern of expression. Allele-specific analysis shows that ZNF127 is expressed only from the paternal allele. Consistent with this expression pattern, in the brain the ZNF127 5' CpG island is completely unmethylated on the paternal allele but methylated on the maternal allele. Analyses of adult testis, sperm and fetal oocytes demonstrates a gametic methylation imprint with unmethylated paternal germ cells. Recent findings indicate that ZNF127 is part of the coordinately regulated imprinted domain affected in Prader-Willi syndrome patients with imprinting mutations. Therefore, ZNF127 and ZNF127AS are novel imprinted genes that may be associated with some of the clinical features of the polygenic Prader-Willi syndrome.

TI	Further evidence for an imprinted gene for neonatal diabetes localised to chromosome 6q22-q23.
PG	1117-21
AB	Transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM) is a rare form of childhood diabetes which usually resolves in the first 6 months of life but which predisposes to type 2 diabetes of adult onset. We recently reported paternal uniparental isodisomy of chromosome 6 (UPD6) in two children with TNDM and proposed that there may be an imprinted gene important in the aetiology of diabetes on chromosome 6. We now describe two unrelated families which independently suggest that the gene is imprinted, is paternally expressed and maps to 6q22-q23. One family has a duplication while the other, with familial TNDM, shows linkage to a marker in this region.

TI	Loss of the actin regulator HSPC300 results in clear cell renal cell carcinoma protection in Von Hippel-Lindau patients.
PG	613-21
AB	Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common malignant neoplasm of the kidney. The majority of hereditary and sporadic ccRCC cases are associated with germline and somatic mutations in the Von Hippel-Lindau gene (VHL), respectively. Gross deletions at the VHL locus can result either in ccRCC or in a mild clinical phenotype, with the absence of ccRCC development. Our goal in this study was to identify the molecular basis responsible for these differences in the clinical behavior in order to predict patients' phenotype. Using multiplex ligation-dependent amplification (MLPA), we identified and characterized gross VHL deletions in Spanish VHL families. A candidate gene related to this clinical association, HSPC300, was identified and depleted by RNA interference. It was possible to narrow the susceptibility region related to the mild clinical phenotype down to approximately 14 kb that included HSPC300 (C3orf10), a regulator of actin dynamics and cytoskeleton organization. Whereas 9 out of 10 families with ccRCC retained HSPC300 in the germline, loss of the HSPC300 locus was associated with mild clinical presentation of the disease in 6 out of 8 families. In fact, genetic depletion of HSPC300 resulted in cytoskeleton abnormalities and cytokinesis arrest in several tumor cell lines including ccRCC cells, suggesting that tumor cell proliferation was compromised in the absence of HSPC300. These clinical and functional data indicate a relevant function of HSPC300 in tumor cell progression, and suggest future therapeutic strategies based upon the inhibition of HSPC300 in renal cell carcinoma and possibly on other cancers.

TI	A novel MSP/DHPLC method for the investigation of the methylation status of imprinted genes enables the molecular detection of low cell mosaicisms.
PG	423-30
AB	We describe a new procedure for the analysis of the methlyation status of imprinted genes based on methylation-specific PCR followed by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (MSP/DHPLC). The method offers a rapid and very reliable alternative to conventional methods used for such purposes such as Southern blots and methylation specific PCR (allele-specific MSP). The efficient resolution of the differentially methylated alleles is demonstrated for two human imprinted genes, namely the SNRPN gene and the LIT1 gene (KCNQ1OT1). Abnormal imprinting of the two genes is associated with the Angelman/Prader-Willi syndromes and the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, respectively. The MSP/DHPLC method is based on PCR amplification of gene segments which show parent-of-origin specific methylation. Genomic DNA is subjected to an in vitro bisulfite treatment prior to PCR amplifications using primers specific for modified DNA. Both alleles are theoretically amplified with equal efficiency and are represented by identically sized PCR products; they differ, however, at a number of positions within the amplified DNA segment. The DHPLC analysis allows a very efficient resolution of the two populations of PCR products. The high sensitivity and quantitative properties of the MSP/DHPLC method are illustrated based on its ability to reveal a low cell mosaicism in an infant with a maternal uniparental disomy 15 (i.e., Prader-Willi syndrome patient). The minor cell line (approximately 8% in blood) was not detectable with conventional molecular analysis. While the detection of low cell mosaicisms of structurally abnormal chromosomes usually relies on cytogenetic studies, the MSP/DHPLC method described here not only offers an alternative at the molecular level, but may also reveal mosaicisms concerning structurally intact chromosomes.

TI	Assisted reproductive therapies and imprinting disorders--a preliminary British survey.
PG	1009-11
AB	BACKGROUND: Recent reports have suggested a higher risk of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) after assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs), but it is unclear whether this might also apply to other disorders of genomic imprinting. METHODS: We contacted families of children with BWS, AS, Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM) to determine use of ART. RESULTS: A statistically significant increased frequency of ART in children with BWS was confirmed [2.9%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4-6.3% vs 0.8% expected] but there was no significant association with PWS or TNDM. Consideration of the molecular subgroup of BWS and AS suggested the feasibility of association with ART. CONCLUSIONS: These differences may relate to variations in (i) the molecular mechanisms for disordered imprinting in the different disorders and (ii) the susceptibility of specific imprinting control regions to ART-associated methylation alterations (epimutations).

TI	Imprinting diseases and IVF: Danish National IVF cohort study.
PG	950-4
AB	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare the frequency of imprinting diseases in children born after IVF with the incidence in naturally conceived children. METHODS: All singleton children born in Denmark from January 1, 1995 through December 31, 2001 were stratified into children born without and after IVF, and were followed from birth until the end of 2002 in the National Register of Patients and the Central Register of Psychiatric Diseases, which include all discharge diagnoses from somatic and psychiatric hospitals/clinics, respectively. Included in the study were malignancies, mental, behavioural and neurological diseases, congenital syndromes, and developmental disturbances. Only diagnosis codes potentially relevant for imprinting diseases were included. RESULTS: During the 7-year study period, 442,349 singleton non-IVF and 6052 IVF children were born. Mean follow-up time was 4.5 and 4.1 years for the two groups, respectively, corresponding to 2 million and 25 000 follow-up years. In the IVF/non-IVF cohort, we detected 0/72 children with cancer, 47/3766 with mental diseases, 72/3654 neurological diseases, 4/287 congenital syndromes and 96/6727 developmental disturbances, in a total of 219/14,506 clinical outcomes. The number of children with specific imprinting diseases in the non-IVF group was 54: 44 kidney cancers, five retinoblastoma, three Prader-Willi syndrome and two Russel-Silver syndrome. Anticipating the same occurrence in IVF children, the total expected number was calculated to be 0.74. The observed number in the IVF group was 0. We found a significantly increased risk of cerebral palsy in the IVF group, with a rate ratio (RR) (IVF:non-IVF) of 1.8 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-2.8; P &lt; 0.01], and of sleeping disturbances, with an RR 2.0 (95% CI 1.2-3.3). The incidence rate of childhood cancers, mental diseases, congenital syndromes and developmental disturbances was equal in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: We found no indication of an increased risk of imprinting diseases after IVF, but an 80% increased risk of cerebral palsy. We observed equal frequencies of childhood cancers, mental diseases, congenital syndromes and developmental disturbances in the two groups. Danish register data do not support reports of an increased risk of imprinting diseases after IVF.

TI	Influence of ghrelin gene polymorphisms on hypertension and atherosclerotic disease.
PG	155-60
AB	Ghrelin is involved in several metabolic and cardiovascular processes. Recent evidence suggests its involvement in blood pressure regulation and hypertension. The aim of the study was to determine associations of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes of the ghrelin gene (GHRL) with hypertension and atherosclerotic disease. Six GHRL SNPs (rs27647, rs26802, rs34911341, rs696217, rs4684677 and a -473G/A (with no assigned rsID)) were investigated in a sample of 1143 hypertensive subjects and 1489 controls of Caucasian origin. Both single-locus and haplotype association analyses were performed. In single-locus analyses, only the non-synonymous rs34911341 was associated with hypertension (odds ratio (OR)=1.95 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.26-3.02), P=0.003). Six common haplotypes with frequency &gt;1% were inferred from the studied GHRL SNPs, and their frequency distribution was significantly different between hypertensive subjects and controls (chi(2)=12.96 with 5 d.f. (degree of freedom), P=0.024). The effect of rs26802 was found to be significantly (P=0.017) modulated by other GHRL SNPs, as its C allele conferred either an increased risk (OR=1.30 (1.08-1.57), P=0.005) or a decreased risk (OR=0.50 (0.23-1.06), P=0.07) of hypertension according to the two different haplotypes on which it can be found. No association of GHRL SNPs or haplotypes with atherosclerotic disease was observed. In conclusion, we observed statistical evidence for association between GHRL SNPs and risk of hypertension.

TI	Physiological interaction between alpha-adducin and WNK1-NEDD4L pathways on sodium-related blood pressure regulation.
PG	366-72
AB	The kidney plays an important role in salt and blood pressure (BP) homeostasis. In previous studies, variants in the genes for alpha-adducin (ADD1), WNK1, and NEDD4L, which all regulate renal sodium absorption, have been associated with increased BP. However, findings have been inconsistent. We tested whether this is because of physiological interactions between the effects of variants in these genes. We assessed the single and combined effects of the ADD1 (Gly460Trp), WNK1 (rs880054 A/G), and NEDD4L (rs4149601 G/A) polymorphisms on renal and BP response to an acute Na load (n=344 subjects), BP decrease after 1 month of treatment with 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide (n=193), and ambulatory 24-hour BP (n=690). Individually, the variants showed modest effects on some of the studied phenotypes. We found the ADD1 Trp allele to be permissive for the effects of variants of the other genes. In combination, the same variants (ADD1 Trp/WNK1 GG/Nedd4L GA+AA) showed a consistent effect on renal Na handling (P=0.009) and acute BP response to a saline infusion (P=0.021), BP lowering after thiazide treatment (P=0.008), and nocturnal systolic BP (P=0.044). Physiological interaction between the ADD1 and WNK1-NEDD4L pathways influences the effects of variants in these genes on sodium-related BP regulation. Relatively common alleles in the ADD1, WNK1, and NEDD4L genes when present in combination may have significant effects on renal sodium handling, BP, and antihypertensive response to thiazides.

TI	Association of parental hypertension with concentrations of select biomarkers in nonhypertensive offspring.
PG	381-6
AB	Children of parents with hypertension are at increased risk of developing high blood pressure. We hypothesize that circulating concentrations of putative biomarkers (that may play a role in development of high blood pressure) are higher in nonhypertensive offspring of parents with hypertension. We compared concentrations of 4 different biomarkers (urinary albumin:creatinine ratio, circulating C-reactive protein, aldosterone:renin ratio, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) in nonhypertensive Framingham offspring study participants with none (n=233), 1 (n=474), or both (n=322) parents with hypertension. Parental hypertension was defined as onset before age 60 years, based on longitudinal observations of the original Framingham cohort. Serum C-reactive protein concentrations were higher in nonhypertensive offspring with 1 (median: 1.7; Q1 to Q3: 0.8 to 3.6 mg/L) or both parents with hypertension (median: 1.8; Q1 to Q3: 0.7 to 3.6 mg/L) compared with offspring without parental hypertension (median: 1.4; Q1 to Q3: 0.7 to 3.2 mg/L). In multivariable analyses, parental hypertension was associated with higher serum C-reactive protein concentration in offspring (15% increase per parent with hypertension; P=0.004). Prospectively, the relation of parental hypertension to longitudinal changes in blood pressure in the nonhypertensive offspring was attenuated on adjustment for C-reactive protein (P=0.04 for attenuation). The levels of the other biomarkers evaluated did not significantly differ in offspring according to parental hypertension status. In conclusion, serum C-reactive protein concentrations are higher in nonhypertensive offspring of parents with hypertension. These data suggest that inflammation may partly mediate the familial influences on hypertension risk.

TI	Hypertension genes are genetic markers for insulin sensitivity and resistance.
PG	799-803
AB	Insulin resistance is a determinant of blood pressure variation and risk factor for hypertension. Because insulin resistance and blood pressure cosegregate in Mexican American families, we thus investigated the association between variations in 9 previously reported hypertension genes (ACE, AGT, AGTRI, ADDI, NPPA, ADDRB2, SCNN1A, GNB3, and NOS3) and insulin resistance. Families were ascertained via a coronary artery disease proband in the Mexican American Coronary Artery Disease Project. Individuals from 100 Mexican American families (n=656) were genotyped for 14 polymorphisms in the 9 genes and all adult offspring and offspring spouses were phenotyped for insulin sensitivity by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp (n=449). AGT M235T and NOS3 A(-922)G and E298D polymorphisms were significantly associated with insulin sensitivity (P=0.018, 0.036, 0.039) but were not significant after adjusting for body mass index. ADD1 G460W was associated with insulin sensitivity only after adjusting for body mass index. The NPPA T2238C and SCNN1A A663T were associated with decreased fasting insulin levels after adjusting for body mass index (P=0.015 and 0.028). In conclusion, AGT, NOS3, NPPA, ADRB2, ADD1, and SCNN1A may well be genetic markers for insulin resistance, and adiposity was a potential modifier for only some gene/trait combinations. Our data support the hypothesis that genes in the blood pressure pathway may play a role in insulin resistance in Mexican Americans.

TI	Epistatic interaction between beta2-adrenergic receptor and neuropeptide Y genes influences LDL-cholesterol in hypertension.
PG	689-94
AB	Beta2-adrenergic receptor gene and neuropeptide Y gene may potentially influence lipid metabolism and overall energy balance. Therefore, we examined associations of these genes with lipid fractions and obesity-related phenotypes in hypertensive subjects. A total of 638 white individuals from 212 Polish families with clustering of essential hypertension were phenotyped for cardiovascular risk determinants. Each subject was genotyped for functional polymorphisms of beta2-adrenergic receptor gene (Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu) and neuropeptide Y (Leu7Pro). Of 3 common haplotypes of beta2-adrenergic receptor gene, Arg16Gln27 was overtransmitted to offspring with elevated levels of total cholesterol (Z=2.2; P=0.026) and LDL-cholesterol (Z=3.2; P=0.002). Individually, Leu7Pro was not associated with any of the metabolic phenotypes in family-based tests or case-control analyses. However, in the presence of Arg allele of Arg16Gly and Gln allele of Gln27Glu, homozygosity for Leu variant of the Leu7Pro polymorphism was associated with 2.1-increased odds ratio (confidence interval, 1.10 to 3.81; P=0.024) of elevated LDL in hypertensive subjects, independent of age, gender, body mass index, adjusted blood pressures, antihypertensive therapy, and use of nonselective beta-blockers and diuretics. Consistently, there was a significant multilocus association among variants of Arg16Gly, Gln27Glu, and Leu7Pro in hypertensive probands with elevated LDL (cases; P=0.028) but not in hypertensive subjects with normal LDL (controls). This study revealed an association of LDL-cholesterol with beta2-adrenergic receptor gene haplotype and provided evidence for epistatic interaction between beta2-adrenergic receptor gene and neuropeptide Y gene in determination of LDL-cholesterol in patients with essential hypertension.

TI	Endothelin-1 gene and progression of blood pressure and left ventricular mass: longitudinal findings in youth.
PG	884-90
AB	Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a powerful vasconstrictor peptide implicated in development of essential hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. To evaluate the impact of genetic variability of the ET-1 gene on progression of blood pressure (BP) and left ventricular mass (LVM), we conducted individual growth curve modeling for 537 European American and black youths with 12 assessments during a 15-year period. Four common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) including T-1370G, +138/ex1 del/ins, T-37/in2C, and Lys198Asn were included in this study. Single SNP analyses showed that individuals with the +138/ex1 ins allele had a borderline significant lower systolic BP (SBP; P=0.072). Furthermore, the -37/in2C allele showed an SBP-lowering effect in males, accounting for 1.6% between-subject variation of SBP (P=0.016). Haplotype analyses in males confirmed the BP-lowering effect of the -37/in2C allele. SBP in individuals homozygous for the del (+138/ex1) -C (-37/in2) haplotype was 3.3 mm Hg lower than those homozygous for the del (+138/ex1) -T (-37/in2) haplotype (P=0.038). For LVM, we observed a significant gene-environment interaction. LVM levels were 20 g higher in carriers versus noncarriers of the -1370G allele in the low socioeconomic status (SES) group only (P=0.004). In summary, our results uncover a sex-specific protective effect of variation in the ET-1 gene on the progression of hypertension risk, and a SES-specific effect on risk of developing left ventricular hypertrophy in multiethnic youth.

TI	Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the IL2RA gene are associated with age at diagnosis in late-onset Finnish type 1 diabetes subjects.
PG	101-7
AB	The onset of type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, with as many as half of all cases diagnosed after age 15. Despite this wide distribution in age at diagnosis, most genetic studies focus on cases diagnosed in childhood or during early adulthood. To better understand the genetics of late-onset type 1 diabetes, we collected a Finnish case/control cohort with all cases diagnosed between ages 15 and 40. We genotyped 591 probands and 1,538 control subjects at regions well established as susceptibility loci in early onset type 1 diabetes. These loci were then tested for disease association and age-at-diagnosis effects. Using logistic regression, we found that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the INS, PTPN22, and IFIH1 loci were associated with late-onset disease (OR (95%CI) = 0.57(0.47-0.69), p = 2.77 x 10(-9); OR (95%CI) = 1.50 (1.27-1.78), p = 3.98 x 10(-6); and OR (95%CI) = 0.81(0.71-0.93), p = 0.0028, respectively). In contrast, a disease association was not detected for two SNPs at the IL2RA locus (rs11594656 and rs41295061). Despite this, we did find an independent age-at-diagnosis effect for each IL2RA SNP using a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model (p = 0.003, 0.002, respectively). Taken together, polymorphisms at the IL2RA locus were a major determinant of age at diagnosis in our cohort with an effect at par with the HLA-DQ2/DQ8 genotype as measured by hazard ratios. These findings suggest that the IL2RA locus controls both the susceptibility to disease and its time of occurrence. Thus, we believe the IL2/IL2R axis represents a potential therapeutic target for delaying the onset of disease.

TI	The intercellular adhesion molecule-1 K469E polymorphism in type 1 diabetes.
PG	107-11
AB	Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes is a complex trait. The region harboring the ICAM1 gene on 19p13 links to type 1 diabetes, and a growing body of evidence indicates that intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) could play a role in type 1 diabetes development. Recently, association studies of an ICAM-1 K469E polymorphism in type 1 diabetes populations have reported conflicting results. Hence, we performed a transmission disequilibrium test analysis of the ICAM-1 K469E variations in 253 Danish type 1 diabetes families. Linkage and association was not found between the ICAM-1 K469E variation and type 1 diabetes in Danish patients (P(tdt)&gt; or =0.48), and our data did not indicate an interaction between ICAM1 and IDDM1 in predisposition to type 1 diabetes in Danes (P=0.78). We did not observe significant association with late-onset type 1 diabetes (P(tdt)&gt; or =0.12) or differences in transmission patterns between groups of affected offspring stratified for age at onset (P&gt; or =0.19), as suggested in Japanese patients. Combined analysis of the present and previously reported transmission data comprising 728 affected offspring of Romanian, Finnish, and Danish ancestry suggested association between the ICAM-1 E469 allele and type 1 diabetes (P(tdt)=0.013), but association was not found in the combined Scandinavian material. In conclusion, we found no association of the ICAM-1 K469E polymorphism with type 1 diabetes or its subsets stratified for age at onset and HLA risk in Danish patients. Analysis of ICAM-1 K469E transmissions reported in three populations suggested association to type 1 diabetes, but also demonstrated heterogeneity between populations.

TI	Antigen-specific responses in autoimmunity and tolerance.
PG	235-44
AB	Autoantibodies to the hormone insulin arise spontaneously in the insulin autoimmune syndrome and in the prodrome of type I diabetes. Further, administration of insulin to individuals without autoimmune disease routinely results in antibodies that bind autologous hormone. These observations suggest that physiological levels of hormones, such as insulin, are below critical thresholds for signaling tolerance induction, a state termed clonal ignorance. In contrast, studies from our laboratory on the genetic origins and structure of V genes used by insulin antibodies suggest that the anti-insulin repertoire is tightly regulated. We have shown that B cells in mice harboring an insulin antibody transgene are functionally silenced. These findings verify that tolerance is active for small molecules, even when they are present at low concentrations. Despite active tolerance, insulin antibodies are sustained in the repertoire of normal animals by several mechanisms, including activation by TI antigen signals, unique display of conformational epitopes, and the recruitment of B cells previously selected by responses to other antigens. This essay reviews our current understanding of escape pathways for anti-insulin B cells.

TI	Comparison of lipid profiles in relation to APOB EcoRI polymorphism in obese children with hyperlipidemia.
PG	65-9
AB	BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate apolipoprotein B-100 (APOB) EcoRI polymorphism and plasma lipid parameters together in children and adolescents. This is the first such study in Turkey to determine possible relationships of these parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three separate groups were studied: a group of obese children with hyperlipidemia, a group of obese children without hyperlipidemia, and a group of healthy children neither with hyperlipidemia nor obesity. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and automatic sequence analysis techniques were used. Sequencing results were examined by Proseq and BioEdit computer programmes. RESULTS: Mutant A allele was not observed in the healthy control group, whereas it was more frequent in the hyperlipidemic obese children; the GA genotype was correlated with total and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels. CONCLUSION: In this study, we suggest that obese child patients having the A allele could have a higher risk for developing hyperlipidemia.

TI	Modulation of macronutrient metabolism in the offspring by maternal micronutrient deficiency in experimental animals.
PG	655-65
AB	Epidemiological evidence indicates that poor early growth is associated with increased susceptibility to visceral obesity, insulin resistance and associated diseases in adulthood. Studies in experimental animals have demonstrated a robust association between nutrient imbalance during foetal life and disease prevalence in their later life specially of those involving macronutrient metabolism. There is very little data on the role of maternal micronutrient deficiencies widely prevalent in India. This review focuses on different animal models of micronutrient restriction, mimicking human situations during pregnancy and lactation that cause aberrations in macronutrient metabolism in the offspring. These aberrations consist of altered body composition, dyslipidaemia and altered insulin sensitivity associated with modulated insulin production. These phenotypic changes were associated with altered lipid profile, fatty acid synthesis / transport, oxidative stress, glucose tolerance / tissue uptake. Further, these were also associated with altered myogenesis and insulin expression and secretion from pancreatic beta-islets. While these changes during in utero or early postnatal life serve as essential adaptations to overcome adverse conditions, these become maladaptive subsequently and set the stage for obesity and type 2 diabetes.

TI	Permanent neonatal diabetes due to KCNJ11 gene mutation.
PG	947-9
AB	Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM) is characterized by the onset of diabetes within the first six months of life and insulin dependence life long. It has been recently discovered that mutation in KCNJ11 gene encoding Kir6.2, the pore forming subunit of ATP sensitive potassium channel (K ATP) is the most common cause and such patients may respond better to oral sulphonylurea drugs than insulin. Here is a rare case of permanent neonatal diabetes due to R20IC mutation in KCNJ11 gene.

TI	Phenotypic heterogeneity and parental origin of extra chromosome 21 in Down syndrome.
PG	429-32
AB	We compared the frequency of phenotypic features of 40 children with Down syndrome between individuals with a maternally or paternally derived extra chromosome 21, using quantitative FISH for comparing heteromorphisms of the nucleolar organizing region. Parental origin was determined in 90% of families. Hypotonia and craniofacial abnormalities were present in 90% or more individuals, irrespective of parental origin of chromosome 21. Congenital heart defects were more frequent in cases with a maternally derived extra chromosome 21. Imprinted gene(s) may contribute to the development of congenital heart defects in Down syndrome.

TI	Single nucleotide polymorphisms in inflammatory genes and the risk of early onset of lone atrial fibrillation.
PG	965-9
AB	BACKGROUND: Systemic low-grade inflammation is a prognostic risk factor of atrial fibrillation (AF). OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that genetic polymorphisms, which determine the rate of inflammatory cytokines, are associated with the risk of AF, independently of comorbidity. METHODS AND RESULTS: We included 192 patients with so-called lone AF and age 40 years or below, and 188 healthy controls. All patients were genotyped for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in inflammatory genes using fluorescence-based real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A case-control analysis of the C/C, C/T and T/T genotypes on IL1A-889 revealed a significant difference in both the frequency of genotypes (p = 0.03) and in the allelic frequency (p = 0.015). These differences were not significant after Bonferroni corrections. For IL1B-511, IL10-592, IL10-1082, IL18-137, IL18-607 and TNF-308 there were no significant differences, neither in genotype frequency, nor in allelic frequency between the lone AF patients and the controls. CONCLUSION: Our study failed to show an association between polymorphisms in inflammatory genes and early onset of lone AF. It remains to be established whether polymorphisms in inflammatory genes play a causative role in the pathophysiology of AF.

TI	Importance of familial factors in associations between offspring birth weight and parental risk of type-2 diabetes.
PG	185-92
AB	BACKGROUND: It is hypothesized that associations found between birth weight and subsequent risk of type-2 diabetes are due to inherited genes affecting both fetal growth and metabolism of insulin. METHODS: To study whether there is a familial (shared environmental and genetic) link between birth weight and type-2 diabetes, the authors used a sample of 11,411 Swedish like-sexed twins born from 1926 to 1958 with at least one offspring, to study the association between offspring birth weight for gestational age and parental risk of type-2 diabetes. RESULTS: Decreasing offspring birth weight for gestational age (with 1 SD) was associated with an increased risk of type-2 diabetes among father's [odds ratio (OR)=1.72, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.33-2.23] and decreased risk among mothers (OR=0.43, 95% CI: 0.30-0.62), independent of grand parental and parental socio-economic status and parental smoking. In paired twin analysis, the association between offspring birth weight and mothers with risk of type-2 diabetes was similar within	and between-twin pairs, whereas father's risk was slightly smaller within than between pairs (OR(Between)=1.90, 95% CI: 1.10-3.28, and OR(Within)=1.71, 95% CI: 1.10-2.67, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The well-established association between paternal type-2 diabetes and offspring birth weight seems to primarily be due to as yet unidentified non-shared environmental factors. However, familial factors shared within twin pairs may contribute to the association.

TI	Relationship of impairment induced by intracellular S-adenosylhomocysteine accumulation with DNA methylation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells treated with 3-deazaadenosine.
PG	638-48
AB	The aim of this study was to estimate the relationship of endothelial dysfunction induced by intracellular S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) accumulation and DNA methylation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). The isolated HUVEC were incubated with 3-deazaadenosine (DZA) to induce experimental intracellular SAH accumulation. The impairment of HUVEC function was assessed by changes in morphology and proliferative ability. The expression of DNA methyltransferase-1 (DNMT1) and the atherosclerosis related genes [oestrogen receptor-alpha (ER-alpha), extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)] were analysed using quantitative real-time PCR. Global DNA methylated status was measured using the cytosine extension assay. The methylated patterns of ER-alpha, EC-SOD and MCP-1 genes were determined with methylation-specific PCR. We found that DZA administration increased intracellular SAH levels progressively and simultaneously decreased Hcy content in medium. Moreover, the supplementation induced HUVEC apoptosis, inhibited proliferation ability and DNMT1 mRNA expression (P &lt; 0.05) and furthermore reduced global DNA methylation status (P &lt; 0.05). Correlation analysis showed the presence of a negative correlation between intracellular SAH concentration, proliferative ability, and expression of ER-alpha, EC-SOD, and DNMT1 (r = -0.89, -0.86, -0.92 and -0.88 respectively, P &lt; 0.001); and a positive correlation with MCP-1 expression and DNA [(3)H]-dCTP incorporation (r = 0.89 and 0.93 respectively, P &lt; 0.001). Our results showed that endothelial dysfunction induced by intracellular SAH accumulation is mediated by regulating the expression of atherosclerosis related genes in HUVEC, which is not related with gene promoter methylated patterns, but may be associated with altered global DNA hypomethylated status. These findings suggest that SAH can act as the potential molecular biological marker in the promotion of atherogenesis.

TI	H2AX gene does not have a modifier effect on ataxia-telangiectasia phenotype.
PG	209-13
LID	10.1111/j.1744-313X.2010.00989.x [doi]
AB	Ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) is a complex disorder characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, immunodeficiency, hypersensitivity to DNA damaging agents and cancer predisposition. Clinical heterogeneity is observed even among the affected siblings with AT. Mutations of the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene are responsible for AT. H2AX, an essential histone protein, is phosphorylated by ATM in response to double-strand breaks, and H2AX-deficient mice share some clinical and laboratory findings with AT. Therefore, we sought a possible modifier effect of H2AX gene on various clinical features in a group of patients with AT and healthy controls. We performed sequence analysis of H2AX gene in 81 patients with AT, and in 51 of them, we analysed methylation. We examined H2AX gene expression in 25 patients. We investigated 48 healthy individuals as a control group. We did not detect any mutation or sequence variation in the H2AX gene, or any altered methylation pattern in any of the patients. Although H2AX gene expression was markedly increased (2.5	to 11.8-fold) in five of 25 patients, and slightly increased (1.5	to 2.4-fold) in four patients, the correlations between H2AX gene expression and the evaluated clinical features of the patients were not significant. Other potential modifier genes that might be scrutinized in AT patients include p53, 53BP1 and TIP60, as well as the genes that effect mitochondrial function and the oxidative response.

TI	The role of the IDDM2 locus in the susceptibility of UK APS1 subjects to type 1 diabetes mellitus.
PG	17-21
AB	Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy syndrome type 1 (APS1) is characterized by autoimmune destruction of endocrine tissues and chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) affects 12-25% of patients with APS1, and the prediction of whether this complication will affect an individual is not currently possible. However, alleles of a variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) 5' of the insulin gene are known to influence the development of T1D in the general, non-APS1 population. Therefore, we investigated the prevalence of these IDDM2 alleles in British Caucasian patients with APS1. The study employed genotyping of 33 patients with APS1 for the HphI polymorphism that is in tight linkage disequilibrium with the insulin gene VNTR alleles. Thirty-three patients with APS1 were studied, the mean age was 23.5 years and 24% have T1D. Six of eight (75%) APS1 patients with T1D were homozygous for the class I INS VNTR (susceptibility) allele, compared with eight of 25 (32%) of APS1 patients without T1D (P = 0.042). Our data suggest an association between the development of T1D and homozygosity for the T1D susceptibility class IINS VNTR allele in patients with APS1.

TI	Folbp1 promotes embryonic myocardial cell proliferation and apoptosis through the WNT signal transduction pathway.
PG	321-30
AB	The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between Folate-binding protein one (Folbp1) and embryonic cardiac proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. Folbp1 gene expression and short interference RNA expression vectors were constructed. Morphology of P19 cells during differentiation was observed by inverted microscope. Cell proliferation was tested using the 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT) method. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by DNA ladder and flow cytometry methods, and marker gene expression during differentiation, such as atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI), and marker gene expression during apoptosis (Bax/Bcl-2) was measured by RT-PCR. Additionally, the critical genes (Wnt, GSK3beta, and/or beta-catenin) expressed in the Wnt signaling pathway were confirmed by RT-PCR. The Folbp1 expressing vector and the silencing vector were constructed. From day 5 of differentiation, the absorbance of cells overexpressing Folbp1 was notably higher than the controls, whereas the controls were notably higher than Folbp1 gene silenced P19 cells. P19 cell apoptosis with Folbp1 gene silencing was lower than the controls; however, more cells were driven into S phase. No significant morphological difference was observed in any of the groups. RT-PCR results show that ANP, cTnI, Wnt, Bax/Bcl-2, and beta-catenin were elevated whereas GSK3beta depressed in cells which overexpressed Folbp1 and was contradictory in Folbp1 gene silenced P19 cells. Folbp1 may be an important candidate mediator of folic acid deficiency-induced congenital cardiac anomalies which are induced by the dysfunction of proliferation and apoptosis of the myocardial cell, and possibly caused by the dysfunction of the Wnt signaling pathway.

TI	Combined effect of C-reactive protein gene SNP +2147 A/G and interleukin-6 receptor gene SNP rs2229238 C/T on anthropometric characteristics among school children in Taiwan.
PG	587-94
AB	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore the combined effect of the C-reactive protein (CRP) +2147 A/G (rs1205) and interleukin (IL)-6R rs2229238 C/T single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the anthropometric variables of school children in Taiwan. SUBJECTS AND DESIGN: Cross-sectional analyses were performed using the data from the Taipei Children Heart Study-II. After multi-stage sampling, we selected 430 boys and 463 girls with an average age of 13.1 years. We genotyped these individuals for the CRP +2147 A/G and IL-6R rs2229238 C/T SNPs using a TaqMan 5' nuclease assay. Anthropometric characteristics, which included body height, body weight (BW), body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), body fat percentage (BF), and waist circumference to height ratio (WHtR), were measured/calculated. RESULTS: When considering the CRP +2147 A/G polymorphism, GG genotype boys were heavier and had larger BMI, WC, HC, BF and WHtR than A allele carriers. The odds ratio (OR) of larger WHtR in GG genotype boys was 2.14 (95% CI: 1.09-4.21). For the IL-6R rs2229238 C/T polymorphism, T allele carrier girls had larger WC and WHtR than those carrying the CC genotype. The OR of a larger HC for T allele carrier boys was 2.33 (95% CI: 1.16-4.68). Boys with the GG genotype of CRP +2147 A/G and the CC genotype of IL-6R rs2229238 C/T had higher OR for BW, BMI, WC, HC, BF and WHtR than boys who were carriers of the A allele of CRP +2147 A/G and had the CC genotype of IL-6R rs2229238 C/T (OR range=3.86-8.04, all P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: Boys who carry the GG genotype of CRP +2147 A/G and the CC genotype of IL-6R rs2229238 C/T have a greater risk of having abnormal BW, BMI, WC, HC, BF and WHtR and of developing obesity than individuals who do not have these genotypes.

TI	A variant near the interleukin-6 gene is associated with fat mass in Caucasian men.
PG	1011-9
AB	CONTEXT: Regulation of fat mass appears to be associated with immune functions. Studies of knockout mice show that endogenous interleukin (IL)-6 can suppress mature-onset obesity. OBJECTIVE: To systematically investigate associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the IL-6 (IL6) and IL-6 receptor (IL6R) genes with body fat mass, in support for our hypothesis that variants of these genes can be associated with obesity. DESIGN AND STUDY SUBJECTS: The Gothenburg Osteoporosis and Obesity Determinants (GOOD) study is a population-based cross-sectional study of 18	to 20-year-old men (n=1049), from the Gothenburg area (Sweden). Major findings were confirmed in two additional cohorts consisting of elderly men from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) Sweden (n=2851) and MrOS US (n=5611) multicenter population-based studies. MAIN OUTCOME: The genotype distributions and their association with fat mass in different compartments, measured with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: Out of 18 evaluated tag SNPs near the IL6 and IL6R genes, a recently identified SNP rs10242595 G/A (minor allele frequency=29%) 3' of the IL6 gene was negatively associated with the primary outcome total body fat mass (effect size -0.11 standard deviation (s.d.) units per A allele, P=0.02). This negative association with fat mass was also confirmed in the combined MrOS Sweden and MrOS US cohorts (effect size -0.05 s.d. units per A allele, P=0.002). When all three cohorts were combined (n=8927, Caucasian subjects), rs10242595(*)A showed a negative association with total body fat mass (effect size -0.05 s.d. units per A allele, P&lt;0.0002). Furthermore, the rs10242595(*)A was associated with low body mass index (effect size -0.03, P&lt;0.001) and smaller regional fat masses. None of the other SNPs investigated in the GOOD study were reproducibly associated with body fat. CONCLUSIONS: The IL6 gene polymorphism rs10242595(*)A is associated with decreased fat mass in three combined cohorts of 8927 Caucasian men.

TI	Morphological and biochemical features of obesity are associated with mineralization genes' polymorphisms.
PG	1308-18
AB	BACKGROUND: Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1) was recently extensively studied as a candidate gene for obesity phenotypes. As the human homologue of the mouse progressive ankylosis (ANKH) and alkaline phosphatase (ALPL) are known functional partners of ENPP1 in bone mineralization, we hypothesized that these genes may also be jointly involved in determining obesity features. AIM: To examine the effects of the three genes, possible gene-sex and gene-gene interactions on variability of four obesity phenotypes: the body mass index (BMI), the waist-hip ratio (WHR), the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and leptin. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In all, 962 healthy individuals from 230 families were genotyped for 45 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The association analysis was performed using two family based association tests (family based association test and pedigree disequilibrium test). The combined P-values of the two tests were estimated by Monte-Carlo simulations. Relative magnitude of the genetic and familial effects, gene-sex and gene-gene interactions were assessed using variance component models. RESULTS: Associations were observed between ENPP1 polymorphisms and BMI (P=0.0037) and leptin (P=0.0068). ALPL markers were associated with WHR (P=0.0026) and EGFR (P=0.0001). The ANKH gene was associated with all four studied obesity-related traits (P&lt;0.0184), and its effects were modulated by sex. Gene-gene interactions were not detected. CONCLUSION: The observed pattern of association signals indicates that ANKH may have a generalized effect on adipose tissue physiology, whereas ENPP1 and ALPL affect distinct obesity features. The joint analysis of related genes and integration of the results obtained by different methods used in this research should benefit other studies of similar design.

TI	Parent-of-origin specific linkage and association of the IGF2 gene region with birth weight and adult metabolic risk factors.
PG	962-70
AB	OBJECTIVE: The maternally imprinted insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) gene is an important fetal growth factor and is also suggested to have postnatal metabolic effects. In this study, we examined whether common polymorphisms in IGF2 (6815_6819delAGGGC, 1156T&gt;C and 820G&gt;A (ApaI)) and a microsatellite marker in the close vicinity of IGF2 were linked to or associated with birth weight and adult metabolic risk factors. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Polymorphisms were genotyped in 199 monozygotic complete twin pairs, 109 dizygotic complete twin pairs, 15 single twins, 231 mothers and 228 fathers recruited from the East Flanders Prospective Twin Survey. Conventional and parent-of-origin specific linkage and association analyses were carried out with birth weight, adult body height and parameters quantifying obesity, insulin sensitivity and dyslipidaemia measured at adult age (mean age 25 years). RESULTS: In the parent-of-origin specific association analysis, in which only the paternally inherited allele was incorporated, the 1156T&gt;C SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) showed significant association with IGF-binding protein 1 (IGFBP1) levels (T and C (mean (95% CI)): 13.2 (12.1-14.3) and 16.2 (14.6-18.0) ng ml(-1), P=0.002). No linkage was observed in either the conventional or in the parent-of-origin specific linkage analysis. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that paternally inherited alleles of a common polymorphism in the IGF2 gene affect IGFBP1 levels.

TI	Variants of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist gene are associated with fat mass in men.
PG	525-33
AB	CONTEXT: Immune functions seem to have connections to variations in body fat mass. Studies of knockout mice indicate that endogenous interleukin (IL)-1 can suppress mature-onset obesity. OBJECTIVE: To systematically investigate our hypotheses that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and/or haplotypes variants in the IL-1 gene system are associated with fat mass. SUBJECTS: The Gothenburg osteoporosis and obesity determinants (GOOD) study is a population-based cross-sectional study of 18-20 year-old men (n=1068), from Gothenburg, Sweden. Major findings were confirmed in elderly men (n=3014) from the Swedish part of the osteoporotic fractures in men (MrOS) multicenter population-based study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The genotype distributions and their association with body fat mass in different compartments, measured with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). RESULTS: Out of 15 investigated SNPs in the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL1RN) gene, a recently identified 3' untranslated region C&gt;T (rs4252041, minor allele frequency=4%) SNP was associated with the primary outcome total fat mass (P=0.003) and regional fat masses, but not with lean body mass or serum IL-1 receptor 1 (IL1RN) levels. This SNP was also associated with body fat when correcting the earlier reported IL1RN+2018 T&gt;C (rs419598) SNP (in linkage disequilibrium with a well-studied variable number tandem repeat of 86 bp). The association between rs4252041 SNP and body fat was confirmed in the older MrOS population (P=0.03). The rs4252041 SNP was part of three haplotypes consisting of five adjacent SNPs that were identified by a sliding window approach. These haplotypes had a highly significant global association with total body fat (P&lt;0.001). None of the other investigated members of the IL-1 gene family displayed any SNPs that have not been described previously to be significantly associated with body fat. CONCLUSIONS: The IL1RN gene, shown to enhance obesity by suppressing IL-1 effects in experimental animals, have not [corrected] previously described gene polymorphisms and haplotypes that are associated with fat, but not lean mass in two populations of men.

TI	Methyl donor supplementation prevents transgenerational amplification of obesity.
PG	1373-9
AB	BACKGROUND: The obesity epidemic, recognized in developed nations for decades, is now a worldwide phenomenon. All age groups are affected, including women of childbearing age, fueling concern that maternal obesity before and during pregnancy and lactation impairs developmental establishment of body weight regulatory mechanisms in the fetus or infant, causing transgenerational amplification of obesity prevalence and severity. The biological mechanisms underlying such processes remain unknown. METHODS: We used agouti viable yellow (A(vy)) mice to test the hypothesis that maternal obesity induces transgenerational amplification of obesity. We passed the A(vy) allele through three generations of A(vy)/a females and assessed cumulative effects on coat color and body weight. By studying two separate but contemporaneous populations of mice, one provided a standard diet and the other a methyl-supplemented diet that induces DNA hypermethylation during development, we tested whether potential transgenerational effects on body weight might be mediated by alterations in epigenetic mechanisms including DNA methylation. RESULTS: The genetic tendency for obesity in A(vy) mice was progressively exacerbated when the A(vy) allele was passed through successive generations of obese A(vy) females. This transgenerational amplification of body weight was prevented by a promethylation dietary supplement. Importantly, the effect of methyl supplementation on body weight was independent of epigenetic changes at the A(vy) locus, indicating this model may have direct relevance to human transgenerational obesity. CONCLUSION: Our results show that in a population with a genetic tendency for obesity, effects of maternal obesity accumulate over successive generations to shift the population distribution toward increased adult body weight, and suggest that epigenetic mechanisms are involved in this process.

TI	Evidence for an influence of TCF7L2 polymorphism rs7903146 on insulin resistance and sensitivity indices in overweight children and adolescents during a lifestyle intervention.
PG	1521-4
AB	OBJECTIVE: The T allele of the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs7903146 in TCF7L2 (transcription factor 7 like 2 gene) is associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study was to analyze whether there is an allele-dosage effect on changes of insulin resistance and sensitivity indices in overweight children participating in a lifestyle intervention. METHODS: We genotyped rs7903146 in 236 overweight children (mean age 10.7 years, mean body mass index (BMI) 28.1 kg/m2) completing a 1-year lifestyle intervention. Degree of overweight as BMI-SDS, homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and the insulin sensitivity index QUICKI were measured before and after intervention. RESULTS: Lifestyle intervention resulted in an overweight reduction of -0.29+/-0.02 BMI-SDS. HOMA-IR (-0.63+/-0.22) and QUICKI (+0.008+/-0.003) indices improved significantly (P&lt;0.05) in the course of the intervention in the 155 children with a decrease of BMI-SDS. There was an additive negative effect of T allele on changes of HOMA-IR (P=0.041) and QUICKI (P=0.001) in linear regression analyses adjusted to changes of weight status, age, gender and pubertal stage. CONCLUSION: Overweight children showed a negative dosage-allele effect per T allele at single-nucleotide polymorphism rs7903146 in TCF7L2 concerning an improvement of insulin resistance and sensitivity after overweight reduction in a lifestyle intervention. This finding further suggests that this polymorphism might be involved in glucose metabolism.

TI	Developmental and epigenetic pathways to obesity: an evolutionary-developmental perspective.
PG	S62-71
AB	Although variation in individual lifestyle and genotype are important factors in explaining individual variation in the risk of developing obesity in an obesogenic environment, there is growing evidence that developmentally plastic processes also contribute. These effects are mediated at least in part through epigenetic processes. These developmental pathways do not directly cause obesity but rather alter the risk of an individual developing obesity later in life. At least two classes of developmental pathway are involved. The mismatch pathway involves the evolved adaptive responses of the developing organism to anticipated future adverse environments, which have maladaptive consequences if the environment is mismatched to that predicted. This pathway can be cued by prenatal undernutrition or stresses that lead the organism to forecast an adverse future environment and change its developmental trajectory accordingly. As a result, individuals develop with central and peripheral changes that increase their sensitivity to an obesogenic environment. It provides a model for how obesity emerges in populations in rapid transition, but also operates in developed countries. There is growing experimental evidence that this pathway can be manipulated by, for example, postnatal leptin exposure. Secondly, maternal diabetes, maternal obesity and infant overfeeding are associated with a greater risk of later obesity. Early life offers a potential point for preventative intervention.

TI	Obesity research in the next decade.
PG	S143-51
AB	The obesity epidemic demands more insight into genetic predisposition, mechanisms, prevention and therapeutic interventions. Opinions about how to prioritize obesity research in the next decade are many and highly varied. However, in this article I have chosen three areas of focus that arguably should be at the top of the list. These include: (1) the physiologic basis of body weight and body fat regulation; (2) epigenetic mechanisms of energy balance; and (3) the prevention of obesity. The approach needs to be translational and bi-directional with a strong emphasis on basic science including studies of relevant gene expression and animal models of energy balance. Clinical research into mechanisms can challenge the existing paradigms that could direct research back to more basic understanding or to applications to populations at risk. Communication between scientists and physicians at the far end of the spectrum needs new and ongoing emphasis.

TI	Common SNPs in LEP and LEPR associated with birth weight and type 2 diabetes-related metabolic risk factors in twins.
PG	1233-9
AB	OBJECTIVE: Children born small for gestational age are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes in adulthood. The satiety signal leptin that regulates food intake and energy expenditure might be a possible molecular link, as umbilical cord leptin levels are positively correlated with birth weight. In the present study, we examined whether common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the leptin (LEP; 19G&gt;A) gene and its receptor (LEPR; Q223R and K109R) are associated with birth weight and adult metabolic risk factors for type 2 diabetes in twins. DESIGN: SNPs were genotyped in 396 monozygotic and 232 dizygotic twins (286 men and 342 women, mean age 25 years) recruited from the East Flanders Prospective Twin Survey. Data were analysed using linear mixed models. RESULTS: The LEPR K109R SNP was associated with birth weight (KK, KR and RR (95% confidence interval, CI): 2511 (2465-2557), 2575 (2516-2635) and 2726 (2606-2845) gram; P(additive)=0.001). Also the LEPR Q223R SNP showed a significant association with weight at birth (QQ, QR and RR (95% CI): 2492 (2431-2554), 2545 (2495-2595) and 2655 (2571-2740) gram; P(additive)=0.003). Furthermore, an interaction between the LEPR K109R and the Q223R SNP on birth weight was observed (P=0.014). G allele carriers of the LEP 19G&gt;A SNP had higher high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels compared to 19A homozygotes (GX vs AA (95% CI): 1.62 (1.58-1.66) vs 1.49 (1.40-1.58) mmol l(-1); P(recessive)=0.013). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that leptin may act as a growth-promoting signal during fetal development, and suggests a possible role for the LEPR in explaining the inverse relationship between birth weight and the development of metabolic diseases in adulthood. Additionally, these results suggest that the LEP 19G&gt;A SNP affect HDL cholesterol levels.

TI	Clinical and genetic associations with hypertriglyceridemic waist in a Canadian aboriginal population.
PG	484-91
AB	OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of 'hypertriglyceridemic waist' (HTGW) in Oji-Cree, to examine its interaction with hepatic nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF1A) in association with type 2 diabetes, and to characterize its putative genetic determinants. METHOD: The presence or absence of HTGW was determined in 522 Oji-Cree subjects (223 males, 299 females), &gt;or=18 years of age, in whom physical measurements and fasting plasma analyte concentrations were gathered, and a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test was administered, as part of a cross-sectional study. Subjects were genotyped for HNF1A codon 319, angiotensinogen (AGT) codons 174 and 235, G-protein beta3-subunit (GNB3) nucleotide 825, fatty acid-binding protein (FABP2) codon 54, nucleotides -455 and -482 of the apolipoprotein (apo) C-III (APOC3) promoter, and a 5-bp insertion/deletion polymorphism within the 3'-untranslated region of protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 3 (PPP1R3). RESULTS: The unadjusted prevalence of HTGW in Oji-Cree adults was 20.5%, with more males affected than females (27.8 vs 15.1%, P=0.0004). Logistic regression analysis, adjusted for age and gender, showed type 2 diabetes was associated with both HNF1A G319S (odds ratio (OR) 4.85, 95% CI 2.45, 9.58) and HTGW (OR 4.96, 95% CI 2.49, 9.88). When the HNF1A mutation and HTGW were present in combination, the OR for type 2 diabetes was markedly increased (OR 43.2, 95% CI 12.4, 150). In women only, both GNB3 825C&gt;T and FABP2 A54T genotypes were significantly associated with HTGW (OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.01, 4.05 and OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.01, 3.74, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: HTGW is prevalent in Oji-Cree, especially in men. The ORs for type 2 diabetes were similar ( approximately 5-fold) for subjects with either the presence of HTGW or the private HNF1A G319S mutation. These two independent risk factors acted synergistically to confer an even greater increased risk of type 2 diabetes.

TI	Common polymorphisms in six genes of the methyl group metabolism pathway and obesity in European adolescents.
PG	e336-44
AB	OBJECTIVE: The goal of the present study was to assess the relationship between the genetic variability in six genes of methyl group (CH(3)) metabolism and the risk of obesity. METHODS: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were selected among the methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), methionine synthase (MTR), methionine synthase reductase (MTRR), cystationine betha-syntase (CBS), transcobalamin-II (TCN2) and paraoxonase-1 (PON1) genes. The associations between SNPs and the risk of obesity were assessed in a case-control study of obese and normal-weight adolescents (age: 14.9+/-1.2 years), and the relationship between SNPs and body fat markers (i.e., body mass index [BMI], percentage body fat [BF%] and waist circumference [WC]) in a cross-sectional study of 1 155 European adolescents (age: 14.8+/-1.4 years). Genotyping was performed on an Illumina system and plasma folate level was determined by immunoassay. RESULTS: In the case-control study, there was no evidence for any association between SNPs of MTHFR, MTR, CBS, TCN2 and PON1 and obesity (all p values &gt;/=0.08). In contrast, two SNPs of MTRR were associated with a higher (rs10520873, Odds Ratio: 1.68 [1.18-2.39]; p=0.004) or lower (rs1801394, 0.61 [0.42-0.87]; p=0.007) risk of obesity. In the cross-sectional sample, rs1801394 was associated with lower BMI (p=0.03) and lower waist circumference (p=0.02). However, after Bonferroni correction these associations were no longer significant. No other significant association or interaction between folate levels and SNPs were detected for anthropometric variables. CONCLUSION: Our findings do not support an association between MTHFR, MTR, CBS, TCN2 and PON1 SNPs and obesity in adolescence. Further investigations are necessary to confirm the possible association between the rs1801394 variant of MTRR and obesity.

TI	Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 677 C-&gt;T polymorphism: a link between birth weight and insulin resistance in obese adolescents.
PG	e312-7
AB	The goal of this study is to determine whether cardiovascular risk and the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 677 C-&gt;T polymorphism (MTHFR), an enzyme involved in folate metabolism and in epigenetics, are linked in morbidly obese non-diabetic adolescents. One-hundred and thirteen obese (BMI = 39.1 +/	6.4 kg/m(2)) adolescents aged 14.4 +/	1.5 years were investigated before entering a weight reduction program. Information on growth obtained from individual health records was available at birth (n = 107), 1 (n = 102), 2 (n = 106), 4 (n = 91) and 8 (n = 73) years of age. Fifty-nine subjects were heterozygote (CT, 52.2%) and 8 were homozygote for the mutation (TT, 7.0%). Birth weights were lower in TT (2.95 +/	0.48 kg, p = 0.004) than in CC (3.34 +/	0.43 kg) and CT (3.38 +/	0.50 kg) subjects, as well as birth lengths (CC: 0.50 +/	0.02 m, CT : 0.50 +/	0.02 m, TT: 0.47 +/	0.03 m, p = 0.01). These differences persisted until 1 year of age. Median and mean fasting glycaemia were similar. Insulin levels were higher in TT (median: 26.4 UI/mL) than in CC (median: 15.0 UI/mL) or CT (median: 16.0 UI/mL) (p = 0.017) subjects, as well as HOMA IR (p = 0.04). Body composition, blood pressure, plasma lipids, homocysteine and leptin concentrations were similar among the three genotypes in both boys and girls. The common 677 C-&gt;T mutation seems therefore to represent a link between altered early growth and enhanced degree of insulin resistance that occurs later in obese adolescents.

TI	Association of GNB3 C825T polymorphism with peak oxygen consumption.
PG	315-9
AB	The C825T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the guanine nucleotide-binding protein, beta polypeptide 3 ( GNB3) gene gives rise to a splice variant, GNB3s that has enhanced G protein activation and signal transduction activity. This variant has been reported to be associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity. We studied this SNP in 95 healthy 18 to 30 year-old African American university students to determine its association with aerobic capacity and cardiorespiratory fitness as measured by peak oxygen consumption (VO (2)peak). We also tested the effect of heart rate variability (HRV) as an independent predictor of VO (2)peak. We tested the association of the SNP and HRV with VO (2)peak in a multivariate regression analysis with appropriate adjustments of covariates, under dominant and recessive models. We found a significant independent association of the 825T allele with VO (2)peak under the dominant model (beta-coef.=-0.101, P=0.0442). We also observed that HRV marginally influenced VO (2)peak. This finding suggests that GNB3 C825T polymorphism is associated with VO (2)peak which is influenced by autonomic modulation of heart rate in African Americans.

TI	Effect of Robo1 on retinal pigment epithelial cells and experimental proliferative vitreoretinopathy.
PG	3193-204
AB	PURPOSE: The Roundabout (Robo) family of proteins is related to the transmembrane receptors and plays a major role in neurogenesis. However, the role of the Robo proteins in proliferative retinopathy has not yet been defined. This study was conducted to determine whether Robo1 is expressed in the retina of patients with proliferative retinal disease and whether it has a pathobiological role in the disease. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the presence and distribution of Robo1 in the pathologic membranes in proliferative retinopathy. Small interfering (si)RNA technology was used to knockdown Robo1 expression and to study its effects on retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells in vitro. The impact on PVR development of blocking Robo1 expression was determined by applying specific siRNA in a PVR rabbit model. The prevalences of PVR and retinal detachment were determined by indirect ophthalmoscope on days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 after the injection of RPE cells into the vitreous. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry showed that Robo1 expression was detected in GFAP-labeled glial cells and cytokeratin-labeled RPE cells in proliferative membranes. Robo1 expression was also detected in CD31-labeled vascular endothelial cells. Knockdown of Robo1 expression not only reduced human RPE cell proliferation in vitro but also effectively suppressed the development of PVR in a rabbit model. CONCLUSIONS: Robo1 is present in the extracellular matrix of proliferative membranes and may be derived from dedifferentiated RPE cells. Silencing the expression of Robo1 in RPE cells inhibited cell proliferation and suppressed the development of PVR in an animal model, indicating a potential therapeutic usefulness in treating PVR.

TI	Suppression of retinal peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma in experimental diabetes and oxygen-induced retinopathy: role of NADPH oxidase.
PG	878-84
AB	PURPOSE: Recently, the authors have shown that NADPH oxidase is positively correlated with increased leukocyte adhesion and vascular leakage in diabetes and neovascularization in oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) agonists have been shown to prevent vascular inflammation and leakage in an experimental model of diabetes. The goal of this study was to investigate whether there is a link between NADPH oxidase and PPARgamma that leads to vascular dysfunction in diabetic retina or OIR. METHODS: Diabetes was induced with streptozotocin in wild-type mice or NOX2 knockout mice. One group of wild-type mice was treated with apocynin. Bovine retinal endothelial cells (BRECs) were treated with normal glucose (5 mM) or high glucose (25 mM) in the presence or absence of superoxide dismutase (SOD) or NADPH oxidase inhibitors (apocynin or diphenyleneiodonium [DPI]). Western blotting and immunofluorescence were used to evaluate PPARgamma expression. Activation of nuclear factor (NF)kappaB was measured using the transcription factor assay kit and Western blot analysis of phospho-NFkappaB. PPARgamma expression was also tested in OIR and lipopolysaccharide-induced retinal inflammation. RESULTS: Retinal expression of PPARgamma was suppressed in experimental models of diabetes, OIR, and retinal inflammation. This was associated with the activation of NFkappaB in the diabetic retina. These effects were prevented by apocynin or deletion of NOX2. PPARgamma expression was also suppressed in endothelial cells treated with high glucose, and this was prevented by apocynin, DPI, and SOD. CONCLUSIONS: Suppression of PPARgamma is involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy and OIR. NADPH oxidase could be an upstream mediator of these changes.

TI	Aquaporin-1 independent microvessel proliferation in a neonatal mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy.
PG	4802-10
AB	PURPOSE: Aquaporin-1 (AQP1) water channels are expressed widely in organ and tumor microvascular endothelia. Rapid microvessel proliferation occurs in growing tumors, diabetic and other retinopathies, and prenatal development. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of AQP1 in retinal vessel proliferation. METHODS: Comparative studies were performed on wild-type compared with AQP1 null mice using an established mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy. Neonatal mice were maintained in a 75% oxygen atmosphere for 5 days to suppress angiogenesis and then were returned to room air to induce vessel proliferation. AQP1 expression was also studied in extraocular microvessels and in primary endothelial cell cultures from pig retina. RESULTS: Surprisingly, AQP1 immunoreactivity was detected in only a small percentage of newly formed retinal microvessels, whereas AQP1 was strongly expressed in all choroidal and hyaloid vessels and in various extraocular microvessels in neonatal and prenatal mice. Oxygen-induced retinal microvessel proliferation was not significantly impaired in neonatal mice lacking AQP1, as quantified in flat-mounted retinas and thin sections. However, AQP1 was expressed in endothelial cells cultured from retinal microvessels. CONCLUSIONS: Microvessel proliferation in oxygen-induced retinopathy is AQP1-independent. Retinal endothelia have the capacity to express AQP1, though intact retinal vessels chronically suppress AQP1 expression.

TI	Pathological but not physiological retinal neovascularization is altered in TNF-Rp55-receptor-deficient mice.
PG	5057-65
AB	PURPOSE: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is one of the major cytokines in inflammation and apoptosis. It has been demonstrated that inhibition of TNFalpha can reduce leukocyte adhesion, vascular leakage, and apoptotic endothelial cell death in diabetes. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of TNF-Rp55 and TNF-Rp75 on retinal development in oxygen-induced retinopathy. METHODS: TNF-Rp55	and TNF-Rp75-deficient mice, as well as their respective wild-type controls, were exposed to 75% oxygen from postnatal day P7 to P12. Retinal vascularization was investigated in flatmount preparations after concanavalin A labeling of endothelial cells on days P6, P14, P17, and P20. Retinal mRNA expression of VEGF, angiopoietin-1 and -2, and PDGF was examined at days P14 and P20. RESULTS: TNF-Rp55	and TNF-Rp75-deficient mice demonstrated similar retinal development and vascularization under normoxic conditions. In comparison to wild-type mice, the vascularized area remained stable during the observation time, although the gene expression of VEGF, angiopoietin (ang)-1 and -2, and PDGFb changed. Compared with that in the wild type mice, the relative expression of VEGF, ang-1, ang-2, and PDGFb changed 5.14-, 1.7-, 0.39-, and 0.36-fold in Rp55(-/-) mice and 4.1-, 9.5 x 10(-5)-, 0.12-, and 2975-fold in Rp75(-/-) mice, respectively. Treatment with oxygen resulted in a significantly reduced vascularization in Rp55(-/-) but not Rp75(-/-) mice on postnatal day (P)20. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of TNFalpha via TNF-Rp55 can alter retinal development and angiogenesis in a model of oxygen-induced retinopathy. The data underscore the potential effectiveness of TNF-inhibitory treatments as modulators in oxygen-induced retinopathy.

TI	Parental high-fat programming of offspring development, health and beta-cells.
PG	118-20
AB	Recent studies extend the concept of developmental and adaptive plasticity to include a paternal role in the programming of metabolic disease, including diabetes. Parents greatly influence the development and health of their offspring. Although genetic imprinting plays a major role in determining offspring health outcomes, non-genetic transmission is also a critical determinant. Programming by parental high-fat feeding has demonstrated adverse effects on beta-cell development and function in offspring. However, maternal and paternal programming effects vary in their potency, with mothers holding the greater influence due to their direct involvement in offspring development and health. Maintenance of parental health pre-conception and during the early phases of offspring life is critical to improve health outcomes of offspring, with the benefit of positive effects on parental health. Preservation and protection of beta-cells throughout offspring life, even before conception, is a strategy to enhance beta-cell survival in offspring.

TI	Autism spectrum disorders and epigenetics.
PG	794-809
AB	OBJECTIVE: Current research suggests that the causes of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are multifactorial and include both genetic and environmental factors. Several lines of evidence suggest that epigenetics also plays an important role in ASD etiology and that it might, in fact, integrate genetic and environmental influences to dysregulate neurodevelopmental processes. The objective of this review is to illustrate how epigenetic modifications that are known to alter gene expression without changing primary DNA sequence may play a role in the etiology of ASD. METHOD: In this review, we summarize current knowledge about epigenetic modifications to genes and genomic regions possibly involved in the etiology of ASD. RESULTS: Several genetic syndromes comorbid with ASD, which include Rett, Fragile X, Prader-Willi, Angelman, and CHARGE (Coloboma of the eye, Heart defects, Atresia of the nasal choanae, Retardation of growth and/or development, Genital and/or urinary abnormalities, and Ear abnormalities and deafness), all demonstrate dysregulation of epigenetic marks or epigenetic mechanisms. We report also on genes or genomic regions exhibiting abnormal epigenetic regulation in association with either syndromic (15q11-13 maternal duplication) or nonsyndromic forms of ASD. Finally, we discuss the state of current knowledge regarding the etiologic role of environmental factors linked to both the development of ASD and epigenetic dysregulation. CONCLUSION: Data reviewed in this article highlight a variety of situations in which epigenetic dysregulation is associated with the development of ASD, thereby supporting a role for epigenetics in the multifactorial etiologies of ASD.

TI	Naturally occurring human genetic variation in the 3'-untranslated region of the secretory protein chromogranin A is associated with autonomic blood pressure regulation and hypertension in a sex-dependent fashion.
PG	1468-81
AB	OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine whether the common variation at the chromogranin A (CHGA) locus increases susceptibility to hypertension. BACKGROUND: CHGA regulates catecholamine storage and release. Previously we systematically identified genetic variants across CHGA. METHODS: We carried out dense genotyping across the CHGA locus in &gt;1,000 individuals with the most extreme blood pressures (BPs) in the population, as well as twin pairs with autonomic phenotypes. We also characterized the function of a trait-associated 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) variant with transfected CHGA 3'-UTR/luciferase reporter plasmids. RESULTS: CHGA was overexpressed in patients with hypertension, especially hypertensive men, and CHGA predicted catecholamines. In individuals with extreme BPs, CHGA genetic variants predicted BP, especially in men, with a peak association occurring in the 3'-UTR at C+87T, accounting for up to approximately 12/ approximately 9 mm Hg. The C+87T genotype predicted CHGA secretion in vivo, with the +87T allele (associated with lower BP) also diminishing plasma CHGA by approximately 10%. The C+87T 3'-UTR variant also predicted the BP response to environmental (cold) stress; the same allele (+87T) that diminished basal BP in the population also decreased the systolic BP response to stress by approximately 12 mm Hg, and the response was smaller in women (by approximately 6 mm Hg). In a chromaffin cell-transfected CHGA 3'-UTR/luciferase reporter plasmid, the +87T allele associated with lower BP also decreased reporter expression by approximately 30%. In cultured chromaffin cells, reducing endogenous CHGA expression by small interfering ribonucleic acid caused approximately two-thirds depletion of catecholamine storage vesicles. CONCLUSIONS: Common variant C+87T in the CHGA 3'-UTR is a functional polymorphism causally associated with hypertension especially in men of the population, and we propose steps (&quot;intermediate phenotypes&quot;) whereby in a sex-dependent fashion this genetic variant influences the ultimate disease trait. These observations suggest new molecular strategies to probe the pathophysiology, risk, and rational treatment of hypertension.

TI	Association of the missense Glu298Asp variant of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene with myocardial infarction.
PG	1506-10
AB	OBJECTIVES: We examined the possible association between the missense Glu298Asp variant of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene and myocardial infarction (MI). BACKGROUND: Endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO) plays a key role in the regulation of vascular tone. Recently, we reported that a missense Glu298Asp variant in exon 7 of the eNOS gene is a possible genetic factor involved in the pathogenesis of coronary spasm. Endothelium-derived NO also has vasoprotective effects by suppressing platelet aggregation, leukocyte adhesion and smooth muscle cell proliferation. METHODS: We screened 285 patients with an MI and 607 control subjects in Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan. Genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment-length polymorphism analysis. RESULTS: The frequency of the missense Glu298Asp variant was significantly higher in the MI group than in the control group (21.1% vs. 13.3%, p = 0.003, odds ratio 1.73 for the dominant effect of the eNOS T allele). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the missense Glu298Asp variant was an independent risk factor for MI, as was diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cigarette smoking, hypercholesterolemia and body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant association of the missense Glu298Asp variant of the eNOS gene with MI. This marker-disease association may be due to the impaired effects of NO on the cardiovascular system: dysregulation of vascular tone, platelet aggregation and leukocyte adhesion and smooth muscle cell proliferation, all of which promote coronary atherosclerosis and thrombosis.

TI	Hyperhomocysteinemia, enzyme polymorphism and thiobarbituric Acid reactive system in children with high coronary risk family history.
PG	386-90
AB	OBJECTIVES: To investigate both the frequency and the genetic background of hyperhomocysteinemia and the frequency of increased plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive system (TBARS) levels in children and adolescents whose parents had premature coronary heart disease (CHD). METHODS: The study was performed on children and adolescents aged 4-18 years (105 offspring of parents with CHD before age 45 and 74 referents from families without any evidence of premature atherosclerosis). Fasting serum total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and total triglyceride (TG) levels were measured by enzymatic methods. Low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level was calculated by the Friedewald formula. Plasma total homocysteine (THCy) level was measured by fluorescence polarisation immunoassay. Plasma TBARS level was determined by fluorimetric method. 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) enzyme polymorphism was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction with restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). RESULTS: Hyperhomocysteinemia was found in 32 cases and in 4 controls. Increased plasma THCy level was found in 10 children and adolescents from 12 cases homozygous for the C677T polymorphism of the MTHFR gene. No similar high frequency was observed in heterozygous subjects. Elevated fasting plasma TBARS levels were found in 38 cases and in 8 controls. The frequency differences were significant (p &lt; 0.01). Allele frequency of the MTHFR polymorphism among cases and controls was similar. Significant correlation (r = 0.53, p &lt; 0.02) was detected between plasma THCy and TBARS levels. One child had high serum TC level, 5 had low serum HDL-C level and all other children had normal serum TC, LDL-C, HDL-C and TG levels from children with hyperhomocysteinemia and/or high plasma TBARS levels. A significant correlation (r = 0.64, p &lt; 0.01) was observed between plasma THCy levels of parents and children in the case group. CONCLUSION: The measurement of plasma THCy and TBARS levels may contribute to the detection of the risk of children and adolescents with high CHD risk family history.

TI	Pathway analysis shows association between FGFBP1 and hypertension.
PG	947-55
AB	Variants in the gene encoding fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) co-segregate with familial susceptibility to hypertension, and glomerular upregulation of FGF1 associates with hypertension. To investigate whether variants in other members of the FGF signaling pathway may also associate with hypertension, we genotyped 629 subjects from 207 Polish families with hypertension for 79 single nucleotide polymorphisms in eight genes of this network. Family-based analysis showed that parents transmitted the major allele of the rs16892645 polymorphism in the gene encoding FGF binding protein 1 (FGFBP1) to hypertensive offspring more frequently than expected by chance (P=0.005). An independent cohort of 807 unrelated Polish subjects validated this association. Furthermore, compared with normotensive subjects, hypertensive subjects had approximately 1.5	and 1.4-fold higher expression of renal FGFBP1 mRNA and protein (P=0.04 and P=0.001), respectively. By immunohistochemistry, hypertension-related upregulation of FGFBP1 was most apparent in the glomerulus and juxtaglomerular space. Taken together, these data suggest that FGFBP1 associates with hypertension and that systematic analysis of signaling pathways can identify previously undescribed genetic associations.

TI	TCF7L2 variants associate with CKD progression and renal function in population-based cohorts.
PG	1989-99
AB	Genetic variants may increase susceptibility to both diabetes and kidney disease. Whether known diabetes-associated variants in the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene are associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and markers of kidney function is unknown. Participants of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC; n = 11,061 self-identified white and n = 4014 black), Framingham Heart Offspring Cohort (FHS; n = 2468), and Heredity and Phenotype Intervention Heart Study (HAPI; n = 861) were genotyped at five (ARIC) and two (FHS) common TCF7L2 variants. The diabetes-conferring risk alleles at rs7903146 and rs7901695 were significantly associated with CKD progression among ARIC participants overall and among those without baseline diabetes. The overall adjusted hazard ratios per rs7903146 T allele were 1.17 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04 to 1.32) for white individuals and 1.20 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.41) for black individuals. Similarly, the overall hazard ratios per rs7901695 C allele were 1.19 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.34) for white individuals and 1.27 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.48) for black individuals. The FHS cohort supported these results: The rs7903146 T allele was significantly associated with lower estimated GFR (P = 0.01) and higher cystatin C (P = 0.004) in adjusted analyses overall and among those without diabetes. In the HAPI cohort, the rs7901695 C allele was significantly associated with lower estimated GFR in adjusted analyses (P = 0.049), as were several variants upstream and downstream of TCF7L2 (P &lt; 0.003). No identified variant in the ARIC or FHS cohorts was associated with albuminuria. In conclusion, several population-based samples suggest that variants in the TCF7L2 gene are associated with reduced kidney function or CKD progression, overall and specifically among participants without diabetes.

TI	Genes, exercise, growth, and the sedentary, obese child.
PG	988-1001
AB	It is still not possible to provide an evidence-based answer to the question of whether regular exercise is essential for normal growth. It is also unclear whether very low levels of exercise result in growth deficits. Regular exposure to exercise is characterized by heterogeneity in responsiveness, with most individuals experiencing improvements in fitness traits but a significant proportion showing only very minor gains. Whether a sedentary mode of life during the growing years results in a permanent deficit in cardiorespiratory fitness or a diminished ability to respond favorably to regular exercise later in life remains to be investigated. Although several genes have been associated with fitness levels or response to regular exercise, the quality of the evidence is weak mainly because studies are statistically underpowered. The special case of the obese, sedentary child is discussed, and the importance of the &quot;energy gap&quot; in the excess weight gain during growth is highlighted. Obese, sedentary children have high blood pressure, dyslipidemia, elevated glycemia and type 2 diabetes, hepatic steatosis, respiratory problems, orthopedic complications, and other health disorders more frequently than normal weight, physically active children. The role of genetic differences in the inclination to be sedentary or physically active is reviewed. An understanding of the true role of genetic differences and regular exercise on the growth of children will require more elaborate paradigms incorporating not only DNA sequence variants and exercise exposure but also information on nutrition, programming, and epigenetic events during fetal life and early postnatal years.

TI	Is gestation in Prader-Willi syndrome affected by the genetic subtype?
PG	461-6
AB	BACKGROUND: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex genetic disorder with errors in genomic imprinting, generally due to a paternal deletion of chromosome 15q11-q13 region. Maternal disomy 15 (both 15s from the mother) is the second most common form of PWS resulting from a trisomic zygote followed by trisomy rescue in early pregnancy and loss of the paternal chromosome 15. However, trisomy 15 or mosaicism for trisomy 15 may be present in the placenta possibly leading to placental abnormalities affecting gestational age and delivery. METHODS AND SUBJECTS: We examined growth and gestational data from 167 PWS infants (93 males and 74 females; 105 infants with 15q11-q13 deletion and 62 infants with maternal disomy 15) to determine if there are differences in gestation between the two genetic subtypes. RESULTS: No significant differences in growth data (birth weight, length, head circumference) or average gestational ages were found between the two genetic subgroups. However, post-term deliveries (&gt; 42 weeks gestation) were more common in the maternal disomy group (i.e., 12 of 62 infants) compared with the deletion group (i.e., 7 of 105 infants) (chi-square test = 6.22; p &lt; 0.02). The distribution of gestational ages in the 15q11-q13 deletion group was more bell-shaped or normal while the distribution in the maternal disomy group suggested a bimodal pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal disomy 15 in PWS may contribute to disturbances in gestational age and delivery by impacting on placental structure or function secondary to the abnormal chromosomal number in the placental cells or in mechanisms leading to the maternal disomy status in PWS infants.

TI	Association of endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene polymorphisms with early-onset ischemic stroke in South Indians.
PG	45-53
AB	AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the association of T-786C, G894T and 4a/b polymorphisms in the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene with early-onset ischemic stroke in South Indians. METHODS: We enrolled 177 patients diagnosed with ischemic stroke aged between 15 to 45 years and 219 age	and gender-matched healthy controls. Genotypes of eNOS T-786C, G894T and 4a/b were identified by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism. RESULTS: The allele and genotype frequencies of eNOS 4a/b, T-786C and G894T did not differ significantly in the patient group compared to controls. Logistic regression analysis indicated the 4a allele to be an independent predictor of ischemic stroke in females (dominant model: OR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.11 to 5.43; p=0.026). Marked differences were found in the prevalence of the minor alleles of the three variants when comparing the South Indian population with the reported frequencies from Caucasians. There was also a contrast in the frequencies of 4ab and T-786C variants from other Asians. The genotypes of all three variants were found to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. There was a lack of significant linkage disequilibria among the variants, and none of the estimated haplo-types increased or decreased the risk of ischemic stroke. CONCLUSION: The eNOS intron 4a/b polymorphism can predict early-onset ischemic stroke in south Indian women.

TI	Thr-encoding allele homozygosity at codon 54 of FABP 2 gene may be associated with impaired delta 6 desatruase activity and reduced plasma arachidonic acid in obese children.
PG	192-6
AB	BACKGROUND: Alanine-for-threonine substitution at codon 54 (A54T polymorphism) in the fatty acid-binding protein 2 gene (FABP2) has been associated with hypertriglyceridemia and insulin resistance. Impairment in the activity of delta 6 and 5 desaturases is also supposed to be a factor predisposing the development of insulin resistance syndrome. AIM: We investigated the relationship between A54T polymorphism in FABP2 and the impairment of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism in obese children. METHODS: Thirty-two obese children participated. During the study, the children continued their habitual diet, which was documented in a 3-day food record using household measures. Anthropometry was performed, and serum lipid and fatty acid composition in plasma were analyzed. The polymorphism of codon 54 in the FABP 2 gene was analyzed. RESULTS: The allele frequency was 0.66 and 0.34 for Ala54 and Thr54, respectively. There were no significant differences in age, body mass index, fasting serum glucose, insulin or serum lipoproteins among the three polymorphism groups. These were also no significant differences in the intake of energy, the percentage of energy nutrients or in the dietary lipid composition. The content of arachidonic acid (AA) in plasma was lowest in Thr/Thr54 (p &lt; 0.05). The indices of delta-6 desaturase (D6D) activity in Thr/Thr54 were significantly lower than in Thr/Ala54 or Ala/Ala54 (p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In obese children, Thr/Thr54 of the FABP 2 gene is associated with impaired activation of D6D and reduced AA content. The results in the LCPUFA profile suggest that Thr/Thr54 may predispose the to development of insulin resistance.

TI	Molecular mechanisms of cholesteryl ester transfer protein deficiency in Japanese.
PG	110-21
AB	Plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) facilitates the transfer of cholesteryl ester (CE) from high density lipoprotein (HDL) to apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins. Since CETP regulates the plasma levels of HDL cholesterol and the size of HDL particles, CETP is considered to be a key protein in reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), a protective system against atherosclerosis. The importance of plasma CETP in lipoprotein metabolism was demonstrated by the discovery of CETP-deficient subjects with marked hyperalphalipoproteinemia (HALP). Genetic CETP deficiency is the most important and common cause of HALP in the Japanese. Ten mutations of the CETP gene have been demonstrated as causes of HALP, including two common mutations: an intron 14 splicing defect (Int14 + 1 G --&gt; A) and an exon 15 missense mutation (D442G). The subjects with CETP deficiency show a variety of abnormalities in the concentration, composition, and function of both HDL and low density lipoprotein (LDL). CETP deficiency is considered a physiological state of impaired RCT, which may possibly lead to the development of atherosclerosis despite high HDL cholesterol levels. However, the pathophysiological significance of CETP in terms of atherosclerosis has been controversial. Epidemiological studies in Japanese-Americans living in Hawaii and Japanese in the Omagari area, where HALP subjects with an intron 14 splicing defect of the CETP gene are markedly frequent, have shown a relatively increased incidence of coronary atherosclerosis in CETP deficiency. On the other hand, the TaqIB polymorphism-B2 allele with low CETP mass and increased HDL cholesterol has been related to a decreased risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) in many studies, including the Framingham Offspring Study. The current review focused on the characterization of the Japanese subjects with CETP deficiency, including our recent findings.

TI	Pro-inflammatory genotype as a risk factor for aPL-associated thrombosis: Report of a family with multiple anti-phospholipid positive members.
PG	60-3
AB	OBJECTIVE: Inflammation might represent a second hit for anti-phospholipid antibody (aPL)-mediated thrombosis. Inflammatory responses have been linked to gene polymorphisms of several cytokines and Toll Like Receptors (TLRs). We examined IL1 beta, TNFalpha, TGFbeta, IL6, IFN gamma, IL10, tlr4 gene polymorphisms in a family with several members positive for IgG anti-beta2 glycoprotein I (beta 2GPI) antibodies but with recurrent thrombosis in one member only. METHODS: Lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin, anti-beta 2GPI IgG/IgM antibodies, IL1beta, TNFalpha, TGF beta1, IL6, IL10, IFN gamma, tlr4 gene polymorphisms (by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction) in addition to standard thrombophilic risk factors and cytokine serum levels (IL-1 beta, TNFalpha, IL-10) were evaluated. RESULTS: Recurrent thrombotic events was reported only in the proband, but not in three healthy siblings persistently positive for IgG anti-beta2GPI antibodies, respectively. The wild type tlr4 gene and cytokine polymorphisms associated with a high pro-inflammatory response (IL-1 beta promoter-511C/T; TNFalpha G/A; TGFbeta+10T/C, +25C/G; IL-6 -174C/G) were found only in the proband. Serum cytokine levels were normal. CONCLUSION: This case report confirms that protective tlr4 gene polymorphisms are more frequent in asymptomatic aPL carriers. In line with the role of inflammatory mediators as second hits for aPL-associated thrombosis, the polymorphisms of cytokines linked to higher inflammatory response were found in the proband only.

TI	A genetic explanation for the rising incidence of type 1 diabetes, a polygenic disease.
PG	174-81
AB	We had earlier hypothesized, if parents originated from previously isolated populations that had selected against different critical susceptibility genes for a polygenic disease, their offspring could have a greater risk of that disease than either parent. We therefore studied parents of patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). We found that parents who transmitted HLA-DR3 to HLA-DR3/DR4 patients had different HLA-A allele frequencies on the non-transmitted HLA haplotype than HLA-DR4-transmitters. HLA-DR3-positive parents also had different insulin (INS) gene allele frequencies than HLA-DR4-positive parents. Parent pairs of patients had greater self-reported ethnicity disparity than parent pairs in control families. Although there was an excess of HLA-DR3/DR4 heterozygotes among type 1 diabetes patients, there were significantly fewer HLA-DR3/DR4 heterozygous parents of patients than expected. These findings are consistent with HLA-DR and INS VNTR alleles marking both disease susceptibility and separate Caucasian parental subpopulations. Our hypothesis thus explains some seemingly disconnected puzzling phenomena, including (1) the rising world-wide incidence of T1D, (2) the excess of HLA-DR3/DR4 heterozygotes among patients, (3) the changing frequency of HLA-DR3/DR4 heterozygotes and of susceptibility alleles in general in patients over the past several decades, and (4) the association of INS alleles with specific HLA-DR alleles in patients with T1D.

TI	Imprinted and genotype-specific expression of genes at the IDDM2 locus in pancreas and leucocytes.
PG	397-403
AB	One of the loci encoding susceptibility to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is IDDM2, mapped to a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism situated 596 bp upstream of the insulin gene (INS). The shorter alleles (class I) predispose to IDDM, while the longer class III alleles are protective. Besides INS, it is possible that transcription levels of IGF2, the nearby gene encoding the insulin-like growth factor II, may be modulated by allelic forms of the VNTR. In an effort to define the pathophysiologic mechanism of the IDDM2 effect, we examined the effect, in cis, of VNTR genotype on steady-state mRNA levels of INS in samples of human fetal pancreas, and of IGF2 in leucocytes of diabetic children. Relative levels of mRNA transcripts derived from each chromosome carrying a defined VNTR allele were measured by RT-PCR, taking advantage of transcribed polymorphisms at the 3' untranslated region of each gene. In 10 samples of human fetal pancreas, INS transcripts from chromosomes carrying a class III VNTR were slightly but significantly (P = 0.015) lower than those from class I (13% lower, 95% confidence limits 3-21%). In 10 leucocyte samples, mRNA from both IGF2 alleles was seen, indicating relaxation of the parental imprinting of IGF2 in these cells. However, this relaxation was incomplete as maternal allele mRNA was systematically at a lower level than paternal. The paternal/maternal ratio varied widely among individual subjects. Two of the most extreme cases, demonstrating almost complete repression of the maternal allele, were identical twins, suggesting that this variable relaxation of imprinting is genotype-dependent. However, this genotype-dependence cannot be accounted for by the maternal VNTR, as the mean ratios of paternal/maternal IGF2 mRNA levels were not statistically different in individuals with a maternal VNTR of class I vs. class III (3.2 +/	1.5 vs. 3.89 +/	0.94). Thus, we present evidence that: (a) class III VNTR alleles are associated with lower INS mRNA in fetal pancreas than class I alleles. The biologic importance of this difference remains to be determined; and (b) the variable relaxation of IGF2 imprinting seen in human leucocytes is not dependent on the presence of a class I vs. a class III VNTR.

TI	The paternally inherited insulin gene B allele (1,428 FokI site) confers protection from insulin-dependent diabetes in families.
PG	687-94
AB	Several polymorphisms of the insulin gene and its flanking regions (INS region) are in linkage disequilibrium and confer susceptibility to insulin-dependent diabetes (IDDM). We have analysed INS AA and AB-BB genotypes at the 1,428 FokI site (3' of the insulin gene) in 217 patients with IDDM, 402 non-diabetic first degree relatives negative for insulin (IAA) and islet cell autoantibodies (ICA), and 116 autoantibody positive (for ICA or IAA, or both) relatives of whom 39 became diabetic on follow-up. Most IDDM patients (83.4%, 181/217) had the AA genotype vs. 50% (25/50) of the controls (P &lt; 10(-6)). Only 16.6% (36/217) of IDDM patients carried the AB genotype and none was BB homozygous, suggesting a protective effect of the B allele. By segregation analysis of the B allele in the IDDM offspring of informative families (only one AB parent) from the United States, the maternal B allele was inherited by 19/35 (54.2%) of the IDDM offspring. In contrast, only 4/26 (15.3%) of the IDDM offspring inherited the paternal B allele (P = 0.001), suggesting maternal imprinting of the INS region. Therefore, the INS B allele may be protective only when paternally inherited. Among the 39 of 116 autoantibody positive relatives who developed IDDM on follow-up, only five of them had the B allele. The frequency of the B allele in this group was much lower (12.8%, 5/39) than that observed in non-diabetic autoantibody positive relatives (32.5%, 25/77, P = 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI	Combined cytogenetic and molecular analyses for the diagnosis of Prader-Willi/Angelman syndromes.
PG	522-6
AB	Prader-Willi (PWS) and Angelman (AS) are syndromes of developmental impairment that result from the loss of expression of imprinted genes in the paternal (PWS) or maternal (AS) 15q11-q13 chromosome. Diagnosis on a clinical basis is difficult in newborns and young infants; thus, a suitable molecular test capable of revealing chromosomal abnormalities is required. We used a variety of cytogenetic and molecular approaches, such as, chromosome G banding, fluorescent in situ hybridization, a DNA methylation test, and a set of chromosome 15 DNA polymorphisms to characterize a cohort of 27 PWS patients and 24 suspected AS patients. Molecular analysis enabled the reliable diagnosis of 14 PWS and 7 AS patients, and their classification into four groups: (A) 6 of these 14 PWS subjects (44 %) had deletions of paternal 15q11-q13; (B) 4 of the 7 AS patients had deletions of maternal 15q11-q13; (C) one PWS patient (8 %) had a maternal uniparental disomy (UPD) of chromosome 15; (D) the remaining reliably diagnoses of 7 PWS and 3 AS cases showed abnormal methylation patterns of 15q11-q13 chromosome, but none of the alterations shown by the above groups, although they may have harbored deletions undetected by the markers used. This study highlights the importance of using a combination of cytogenetic and molecular tests for a reliable diagnosis of PWS or AS, and for the identification of genetic alterations.

TI	Analysis of two KCNJ11 neonatal diabetes mutations, V59G and V59A, and the analogous KCNJ8 I60G substitution: differences between the channel subtypes formed with SUR1.
PG	6752-62
AB	beta-Cell-type K(ATP) channels are octamers assembled from Kir6.2/KCNJ11 and SUR1/ABCC8. Adenine nucleotides play a major role in their regulation. Nucleotide binding to Kir6.2 inhibits channel activity, whereas ATP binding/hydrolysis on sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) opposes inhibition. Segments of the Kir6.2 N terminus are important for open-to-closed transitions, form part of the Kir ATP, sulfonylurea, and phosphoinositide binding sites, and interact with L0, an SUR cytoplasmic loop. Inputs from these elements link to the pore via the interfacial helix, which forms an elbow with the outer pore helix. Mutations that destabilize the interfacial helix increase channel activity, reduce sensitivity to inhibitory ATP and channel inhibitors, glibenclamide and repaglinide, and cause neonatal diabetes. We compared Kir6.x/SUR1 channels carrying the V59G substitution, a cause of the developmental delay, epilepsy, and neonatal diabetes syndrome, with a V59A substitution and the equivalent I60G mutation in the related Kir6.1 subunit from vascular smooth muscle. The substituted channels have increased P(O) values, decreased sensitivity to inhibitors, and impaired stimulation by phosphoinositides but retain sensitivity to Ba(2+)-block. The V59G and V59A channels are either not, or poorly, stimulated by phosphoinositides, respectively. Inhibition by sequestrating phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate with neomycin and polylysine is reduced in V59A, and abolished in V59G channels. Stimulation by SUR1 is intact, and increasing the concentration of inhibitory ATP restores the sensitivity of Val-59-substituted channels to glibenclamide. The I60G channels, strongly dependent on SUR stimulation, remain sensitive to sulfonylureas. The results suggest the interfacial helix dynamically links inhibitory inputs from the Kir N terminus to the gate and that sulfonylureas stabilize an inhibitory configuration.

TI	Characterization of the methylation-sensitive promoter of the imprinted ZAC gene supports its role in transient neonatal diabetes mellitus.
PG	18653-6
AB	ZAC is a recently isolated zinc finger protein that induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. The corresponding gene is imprinted maternally through an unknown mechanism and maps to 6q24-q25, within the minimal interval harboring the gene responsible for transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM) and a tumor suppressor gene involved in breast cancer. Because of its functional properties, imprinting status, and expression pattern in mammary cell lines and tumors, ZAC is the best candidate so far for both disease conditions. In the present work, we delineated ZAC genomic organization and mapped its transcriptional start site. It is noteworthy that the ZAC promoter localized to the CpG island harboring the methylation imprint associated with TNDM and methylation of this promoter silenced its activity. These data indicate that the methylation mark may have a direct effect on the silencing of the ZAC imprinted allele. Our findings further strengthen the hypothesis that ZAC is the gene responsible for TNDM and suggest a novel mechanism for ZAC inactivation in breast tumors.

TI	Gene-gene interactions in the folate metabolic pathway and the risk of conotruncal heart defects.
PG	630940
AB	Conotruncal and related heart defects (CTRD) are common, complex malformations. Although there are few established risk factors, there is evidence that genetic variation in the folate metabolic pathway influences CTRD risk. This study was undertaken to assess the association between inherited (i.e., case) and maternal gene-gene interactions in this pathway and the risk of CTRD. Case-parent triads (n = 727), ascertained from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, were genotyped for ten functional variants of nine folate metabolic genes. Analyses of inherited genotypes were consistent with the previously reported association between MTHFR A1298C and CTRD (adjusted P = .02), but provided no evidence that CTRD was associated with inherited gene-gene interactions. Analyses of the maternal genotypes provided evidence of a MTHFR C677T/CBS 844ins68 interaction and CTRD risk (unadjusted P = .02). This association is consistent with the effects of this genotype combination on folate-homocysteine biochemistry but remains to be confirmed in independent study populations.

TI	Beta1 and beta2-adrenergic receptor polymorphisms and idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias.
PG	1053-8
AB	INTRODUCTION: Idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias commonly refer to ventricular tachycardia (VT) and/or frequent/monomorphic premature ventricular contractions (PVC) in patients with structurally normal heart. Activation of sympathetic tone has been shown to play an important role in the provocation and maintenance of these arrhythmias. We investigated whether common single nucleotide polymorphisms in the beta(1) and beta(2)-adrenergic receptors are associated with idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias. METHODS: A total of 143 unrelated patients presenting with idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias were prospectively included in a case-control association study. Patient population was matched by age and gender to the unrelated, healthy control subjects (N = 307). All study subjects were of Turkish (Anatolian Caucasian) descent. Allele and genotype frequencies of the Gly389Arg and Ser49Gly polymorphisms of the beta(1)-adrenergic receptor and Arg16Gly, Gln27Glu, and Thr164Ile polymorphisms of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor were compared between patient population and control subjects. The genotype frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. RESULTS: Patients with idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias had higher frequency of Arg389Arg genotype (22.4% vs 1.6%, P &lt; 0.001), Arg389Gly49 (5.24% vs 0.73%, P = 0.005), and Arg389Ser49 (36.7% vs 13.6%, P &lt; 0.001) haplotypes of the beta(1)-adrenergic receptor, and higher frequency of Gly16Gly (31.5% vs 13.4%, P &lt; 0.001), Glu27Glu genotypes (18.2% vs 10.1%, P = 0.006) and Gly16Gln27Thr164 (15.3% vs 7.4%, P = 0.002), Gly16Glu27Thr164 (13.1% vs 7%, P = 0.004), and Gly16Glu27Ile164 (13.2% vs 6%, P = 0.002) haplotypes of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor compared to control subjects. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that common single nucleotide polymorphisms in the beta(1) and beta(2)-adrenergic receptors are significantly associated with idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias in Turkish population.

TI	Cardiac arrest and left ventricular fibrosis in a Finnish family with the lamin A/C mutation.
PG	743-7
AB	INTRODUCTION: We screened the candidate genes from a Finnish family in which the mother was resuscitated from ventricular fibrillation and the daughter died suddenly without any prior cardiac symptoms. METHODS AND RESULTS: In addition to screening of potential structural gene mutations, phenotyping of the proband and medico-legal autopsy of the victim of the sudden death, including histopathological examinations, were performed. Genetic screening revealed an R541C mutation in the lamin A/C gene both in the proband and her daughter. None of the 16 first	or second-degree relatives, or 96 unrelated healthy subjects, carried the same mutation. In the proband, the size and the global function of the left ventricle (LV) were normal, but a local hypokinesia and thinning of inferoposterior area of the LV were seen in 2D echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging. Coronary angiogram and the results of the electrophysiological study were normal. Autopsy of the victim of sudden death showed localized thinning and fibrosis in the inferoposterior area of the LV, with only minimal fibrosis in the right ventricle and no abnormalities in the interventricular septum. CONCLUSION: These observations indicate that a fatal or near-fatal cardiac arrhythmia can be the first clinical manifestation of a &quot;de novo&quot; mutation R541C of the lamin A/C gene. Replacement of cardiac myocytes by fibrosis seems to be the predominant pathologic-anatomic finding.

TI	Effect of the insertion/deletion polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme gene on response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with heart failure.
PG	988-94
AB	There is marked interindividual variation in serum and tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels for which the insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism in intron 16 of the ACE gene is a marker. ACE inhibitors have important effects on morbidity and mortality in heart failure. The influence of this polymorphism on the response to ACE inhibitors in patients with heart failure is not known. We studied response by ACE genotype of 34 subjects in a randomised, double-blind, crossover study comparing 6 weeks of lisinopril (10 mg, o.d.) or captopril (25 mg, t.d.s.) on 24-h blood pressure (BP) profile and on renal function in patients with symptomatic heart failure [mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), 24%]. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), 99mTc diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), and ambulatory 24-h mean arterial pressure (MAP; Spacelabs 90207) were assessed at the beginning and end of treatment periods. There was a significant relation between ACE genotype and change in MAP with captopril (mm Hg; DD group, -0.5; ID, -4.7; II, -7.4; p = 0.02) but not to lisinopril (mm Hg DD, -6.0; ID, -6.6; II, -7.4; p = 0.89) in these patients. There was no significant relation between genotype and change in GFR with captopril (percentage change from baseline: DD, +7.9; ID, +13.1; II, -0.6; p = 0.45) or lisinopril (percentage change from baseline: DD, -0.1; ID, -3.0; II, -13.3; p = 0.39), but the decline in renal function tended to be greatest in II subjects. Whereas the results are not conclusive, there may be a significant interaction between ACE genotype and response to ACE inhibitors in patients with heart failure.

TI	The T allele of the 677C&gt;T polymorphism of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene is associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke in Polish children.
PG	1262-7
AB	Ischemic stroke is a very rare and multifactorial disease in children. The aim of the study was to analyze the relationship between the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C&gt;T polymorphism and stroke in Polish children and to observe whether there is any significant transmission of MTHFR alleles from heterozygous parents to their affected offspring. We analyzed 64 patients with stroke, 122 parents, and 59 healthy children. The MTHFR polymorphism was genotyped using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The T allele was more frequent in the stroke group (38%) than in controls (25%, P = .029, odds ratio = 1.84). We also found higher frequency of T allele in male patients compared to male controls (46% vs. 25%, P = .009, odds ratio = 2.53). The number of T allele carriers was again more prevalent in boys with stroke (71%) than in healthy boys (45%, P = .023, odds ratio = 3.09). The T allele was significantly transmitted in male patients (P &lt; .019). We conclude that the MTHFR 677C&gt;T polymorphism may be considered as a genetic risk factor of childhood stroke, especially in boys.

TI	Role of TNF-alpha gene variation in idiopathic childhood ischemic stroke: a case-control study.
PG	25-9
AB	Etiology of the idiopathic childhood stroke remains unknown. In previous studies, the immunologic process may be involved in the idiopathic stroke. Tumor necrosis factor	alpha (TNF-alpha), an important immune mediator, may contribute to the initiation and progression in the stroke. The main purpose of this study was to investigate correlation of TNF-alpha genetic variation and idiopathic childhood ischemic stroke. Using the direct DNA sequencing method, polymorphisms in the TNF-alpha promoter region were genotyped in 67 Chinese patients with idiopathic childhood stroke and 70 controls. Among totally 7 single nucleotide polymorphisms identified in the TNF-alpha promoter region, the variant of the -863C/A is associated with increased risk of idiopathic childhood ischemic stroke in our study group. TNF-alpha molecule may have genetically as well as functionally an important role in the pathogenesis of idiopathic childhood ischemic stroke in the Chinese population.

TI	Persistent growth failure in Prader-Willi syndrome associated with short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase gene variant.
PG	112-7
AB	The authors report the rare association of Prader-Willi syndrome and short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase gene variant. Prader-Willi syndrome, associated with paternal chromosome 15q11-q13 silencing, is characterized by neonatal/infantile hypotonia, growth failure, and neurodevelopmental delays in the first 1 to 2 years of life, typically followed by hyperphagia and obesity. Short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase gene variant, with 625 G-to-A and 511 C-to-T changes, impairs C4-C6 fatty acid metabolism and variably causes neonatal/infantile hypotonia with developmental delays. The authors' patient continues to exhibit the classic severe growth failure of early infancy Prader-Willi syndrome at 40 months. Extensive laboratory investigations indicate that the short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase gene variant is likely preventing or delaying the normal expression of the Prader-Willi syndrome phenotype.

TI	Factor V1691 G-A, prothrombin 20210 G-A, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 677 C-T variants in Turkish children with cerebral infarct.
PG	749-51
AB	Inherited gene defects related to the coagulation system have been reported as risk factors for ischemic stroke. These gene defects include a G-A transition at nucleotide 1691 in exon 10 of the Factor V gene causing activated protein C resistance; a G-A transition in the 3' untranslated region of the prothrombin gene at nucleotide position 20210 (G-A), which is associated with increased levels of prothrombin activity; and a C-T polymorphism at nucleotide 677 in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene responsible for an alanine to valine substitution, resulting in the synthesis of a thermolabile form of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase that causes increased levels of homocysteine. The case-control study included 28 patients with cerebral infarction; all were 18 years of age or younger (range, 10 months to 18 years). Seven (25%) of the 28 patients were heterozygous for the FV1691 mutation. Five (17.8%) of the patients carried the PT20210A mutation. Two (7.1%) of the patients carried both mutations. When compared to controls, the difference was significant for both mutations (P = .007; .04). The frequency of allele T of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 677 was 0.3214, which was not significant when compared to controls (0.231; P = .3). A total of 12 (42.8%) patients carried one or both of the mutations FV1691 G-A and PT20210 G-A. From our data, it appears that FV1691 G-A and PT20210 G-A are associated with cerebral infarct risk independently. Risk assessment of double prothrombotic gene alterations did not reveal synergy between these mutations. In conclusion, the presence of FV1691 A and PT20210 A mutations but not the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 677 TT mutation correlate with the occurrence of cerebral infarction in children.

TI	Genomic imprinting and the expression of affect in Angelman syndrome: what's in the smile?
PG	571-9
AB	BACKGROUND: Kinship theory (or the genomic conflict hypothesis) proposes that the phenotypic effects of genomic imprinting arise from conflict between paternally and maternally inherited alleles. A prediction arising for social behaviour from this theory is that imbalance in this conflict resulting from a deletion of a maternally imprinted gene, as in Angelman syndrome (AS), will result in a behavioural phenotype that should evidence behaviours that increase access to maternally provided social resources (adult contact). METHOD: Observation of the social behaviour of children with AS (n = 13), caused by a deletion at 15q11-q13, and a matched comparison group (n = 10) was undertaken for four hours in a socially competitive setting and the effect of adult attention on child behaviours and the effect of child smiling on adult behaviours evaluated using group comparisons and observational lag sequential analyses. RESULTS: The AS group smiled more than the comparison group in all settings, which had different levels of adult attention, and more when the level of adult attention was high. Smiling by children with AS evoked higher levels of adult attention, eye contact and smiling both than by chance and in comparison to other children and this effect was sustained for 30 s to 50 s. Smiling by children with AS was frequently preceded by child initiated contact toward the adult. DISCUSSION: The results are consistent with a kinship theory explanation of the function of heightened levels of sociability and smiling in Angelman syndrome and provide support for an emotion signalling interpretation of the mechanism by which smiling accesses social resources. Further research on other behaviours characteristic of Angelman and Prader-Willi syndromes warrant examination from this perspective.

TI	Genotype and tissue-specific effects on alternative splicing of the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene in humans.
PG	1450-7
AB	Context: Noncoding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the TCF7L2 gene are confirmed risk factors for type 2 diabetes, but the mechanism by which they increase risk is unknown. Objective: We hypothesized that associated SNPs alter TCF7L2 splicing and that splice forms have altered biological roles. Design: Splice forms and 5' and 3' untranslated regions were characterized in sc adipose, muscle, liver, HepG2 cells, pancreas, and islet. Isoform-specific transcript levels were quantified in sc adipose. Alternative splice forms were characterized in HepG2 liver cells under glucose and insulin conditions and in SGBS cells with differentiation. Major isoforms were characterized by transfection. Setting: The study was conducted at an ambulatory general clinical research center. Patients: Patients included 78 healthy, nondiabetic study subjects characterized for insulin sensitivity and secretion. Results: We identified 32 alternatively spliced transcripts and multiple-length 3' untranslated region transcripts in adipose, muscle, islet, and pancreas. Alternative exons 3a, 12, 13, and 13a were observed in all tissues, whereas exon 13b was islet specific. Transcripts retaining exons 13 and 13a but not total TCF7L2 transcripts were significantly correlated with both obesity measures (P &lt; 0.01) and rs7903146 genotype (P &lt; 0.026) in sc adipose. Insulin (5-10 nm) suppressed all TCF7L2 isoforms in SGBS cells but suppressed exon 13a-containing isoforms most significantly (P &lt; 0.001). The isoform distribution differed throughout SGBS cell differentiation. Isoforms with predicted early stop codons yielded stable proteins of the predicted size, bound beta-catenin, and targeted correctly to the nucleus. Conclusions: Intronic TCF7L2 variants may regulate alternative transcript isoforms, which in turn may have distinct physiologic roles.

TI	Deoxyribonucleic acid methylation and gene expression of PPARGC1A in human muscle is influenced by high-fat overfeeding in a birth-weight-dependent manner.
PG	3048-56
AB	CONTEXT: Low birth weight (LBW) and unhealthy diets are risk factors of metabolic disease including type 2 diabetes (T2D). Genetic, nongenetic, and epigenetic data propose a role of the key metabolic regulator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, coactivator 1alpha (PPARGC1A) in the development of T2D. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to investigate gene expression and DNA methylation of PPARGC1A and coregulated oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes in LBW and normal birth weight (NBW) subjects during control and high-fat diets. DESIGN, SUBJECTS, AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Twenty young healthy men with LBW and 26 matched NBW controls were studied after 5 d high-fat overfeeding (+50% calories) and after a control diet in a randomized manner. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps were performed and skeletal muscle biopsies excised. DNA methylation and gene expression were measured using bisulfite sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR, respectively. RESULTS: When challenged with high-fat overfeeding, LBW subjects developed peripheral insulin resistance and reduced PPARGC1A and OXPHOS (P &lt; 0.05) gene expression. PPARGC1A methylation was significantly higher in LBW subjects (P = 0.0002) during the control diet. However, PPARGC1A methylation increased in only NBW subjects after overfeeding in a reversible manner. DNA methylation of PPARGC1A did not correlate with mRNA expression. CONCLUSIONS: LBW subjects developed peripheral insulin resistance and decreased gene expression of PPARGC1A and OXPHOS genes when challenged with fat overfeeding. The extent to which our finding of a constitutively increased DNA methylation in the PPARGC1A promoter in LBW subjects may contribute needs to be determined. We provide the first experimental support in humans that DNA methylation induced by overfeeding is reversible.

TI	Intragenic GNAS deletion involving exon A/B in pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1A resulting in an apparent loss of exon A/B methylation: potential for misdiagnosis of pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1B.
PG	765-71
AB	Context: Several endocrine diseases that share resistance to PTH are grouped under the term pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP). Patients with PHP type Ia show additional hormone resistance, defective erythrocyte G(s)alpha activity, and dysmorphic features termed Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO). Patients with PHP-Ib show less diverse hormone resistance and normal G(s)alpha activity; AHO features are typically absent in PHP-Ib. Mutations affecting G(s)alpha coding exons of GNAS and epigenetic alterations in the same gene are associated with PHP-Ia and -Ib, respectively. The epigenetic GNAS changes in familial PHP-Ib are caused by microdeletions near or within GNAS but without involving G(s)alpha coding exons. Objective: We sought to identify the molecular defect in a patient who was diagnosed with PHP-Ia based on clinical presentation (hormone resistance and AHO) but displayed the molecular features typically associated with PHP-Ib (loss of methylation at exon A/B) without previously described genetic mutations. Methods: Microsatellite typing, comparative genome hybridization, and allelic dosage were performed for proband and her parents. Results: Comparative genome hybridization revealed a deletion of 30,431 bp extending from the intronic region between exons XL and A/B to intron 5. The same mutation was also demonstrated, by PCR, in the patient's mother, but polymorphism and allele dosage analyses indicated that she had this mutation in a mosaic manner. Conclusion: We discovered a novel multiexonic GNAS deletion transmitted to our patient from her mother who is mosaic for this mutation. The deletion led to different phenotypic manifestations in the two generation and appeared, in the patient, as loss of GNAS imprinting.

TI	Vascular endothelial estrogen receptor alpha is modulated by estrogen status and related to endothelial function and endothelial nitric oxide synthase in healthy women.
PG	3513-20
AB	CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha), a potent transcription factor expressed in vascular endothelial cells, plays a key role in regulating vascular function and health. We determined whether vascular endothelial cell expression of ER alpha is influenced by estrogen status and is related to vascular endothelial function in healthy women. METHODS: ER alpha protein expression was measured (quantitative immunofluorescence) in endothelial cells from peripheral veins of 16 healthy, premenopausal women during the early follicular (EF) and late follicular (LF) phases of the menstrual cycle and 17 estrogen-deficient postmenopausal women. Endothelial-dependent dilation (EDD; brachial artery flow-mediated dilation) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression and activation were also measured in a subgroup of women. RESULTS: In premenopausal women (n = 10), ER alpha expression was 30% lower (P &lt; 0.001) during the EF (low estrogen) compared with the LF (high estrogen) phase of the menstrual cycle. In postmenopausal women, ER alpha expression was 33% lower (P &lt; 0.001) compared with the LF phase of the menstrual cycle in premenopausal women. ER alpha expression was strongly related (r = 0.67; P &lt; 0.001) to EDD, which was reduced in postmenopausal women. ER alpha abundance was positively related to expression of eNOS (r = 0.54; P = 0.009; n = 21) and ser1177 phosphorylated eNOS (r = 0.59; P = 0.006; n = 20). CONCLUSIONS: These results provide the first evidence that expression of ER alpha in vascular endothelial cells is modulated by estrogen status and may be a key determinant of vascular endothelial function in healthy pre	and postmenopausal women. ER alpha expression may influence vascular endothelial function in women by affecting protein levels and activation of eNOS.

TI	Genetic variants of TCF7L2 are associated with insulin resistance and related metabolic phenotypes in Taiwanese adolescents and Caucasian young adults.
PG	3575-82
AB	OBJECTIVES: The effect of TCF7L2 rs7903146 on glucose homeostasis is considered primarily due to impaired insulin secretion in European populations. Because we previously demonstrated that TCF7L2 rs290487 near the 3' end of TCF7L2 was significantly associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Taiwanese subjects, we aimed to investigate potential mechanisms underlying the associations of rs290487 with T2D. METHODS: Eighteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested for association with glucose/insulin homeostasis as well as other quantitative metabolic phenotypes using the quantitative transmission disequilibrium test in 525 Taiwanese adolescent twin-pairs and siblings. The results were further replicated in 116 nondiabetic normotensive Caucasian young adults. RESULTS: Among the 18 SNPs, rs290487 C allele was significantly associated with higher 60-, 90-, and 120-min glucose concentrations (P = 0.001, 0.01, and 0.02, respectively); higher 60	and 90-min insulin concentrations (P = 0.01 and 0.01, respectively); and a lower insulin sensitivity index (P = 0.04). No association was found for rs290487 with measures of insulin secretion. The rs290487 C allele was also associated with HOMA-IR (P = 0.005) and insulin sensitivity index (P = 0.01) in Caucasian young adults. Another SNP, rs10749127 C allele located in intron 4, was also associated with features of the metabolic syndrome, including elevated systolic (P = 0.02) and diastolic (P = 2.0 x 10(-4)) blood pressure, triglycerides (P = 7.0 x 10(-4)), and uric acid (P = 0.03). In a meta-analysis, the rs290487 C allele was confirmed to be associated with an increased risk of T2D (odds ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.19; P = 0.005) across East Asian populations. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support an important role for T2D risk-conferring gene TCF7L2 in insulin resistance in both Taiwanese and Caucasian youth and underscore the emerging role of Wnt signaling in insulin resistance.

TI	Parasympathetic paragangliomas are part of the Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome.
PG	4367-71
AB	CONTEXT: Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, caused by germline mutations in the VHL gene, is a hereditary tumor syndrome manifested by hemangioblastomas, clear cell renal cell carcinomas, and pheochromocytomas. In addition, a multitude of other rare tumors, including parasympathetic paragangliomas, can occur and even be the sole manifestation of VHL disease. The VHL gene is a bona fide tumor suppressor gene with biallelic inactivation contributing to tumor formation. However, in parasympathetic paragangliomas occurring in VHL disease, biallelic inactivation of the VHL gene has not been demonstrated to date. DESIGN: The head and neck paragangliomas of two VHL patients were analyzed for mutations by direct sequencing of the VHL gene. In addition loss of heterozygosity analysis was performed for three microsatellite loci near the VHL gene. To rule out other underlying genetic causes of the parasympathetic paragangliomas, mutation analysis of the SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD genes was also performed. RESULTS: Apart from germline VHL mutations, no additional mutations were found in the paraganglioma-related tumor suppressor genes SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD. Analysis of paraganglioma tissue revealed loss of the VHL wild-type allele in both tumors, indicating that in these tumors biallelic VHL gene inactivation occurred. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that parasympathetic paragangliomas in VHL disease, although rare, are part of the syndrome and related to VHL gene inactivation. Clinicians should be aware of the potential occurrence of parasympathetic paragangliomas in VHL disease.

TI	Expanded clinical spectrum in hepatocyte nuclear factor 1b-maturity-onset diabetes of the young.
PG	2658-64
AB	AIMS: HNF1B-maturity-onset diabetes of the young is caused by abnormalities in the HNF1B gene encoding the transcription factor HNF-1beta. We aimed to investigate detailed clinical features and the type of HNF1B gene anomaly in five pediatric cases with HNF1B-MODY. METHODS: From a cohort of 995 children and adolescents with diabetes, we analyzed the most frequent maturity-onset diabetes of the young genes (GCK, HNF1A, HNF4A) including HNF1B sequencing and deletion analysis by quantitative Multiplex-PCR of Short Fluorescent Fragments (QMPSF) if patients were islet autoantibody-negative and had one parent with diabetes or associated extrapancreatic features or detectable C-peptide outside honeymoon phase. Presence and size of disease-causing chromosomal rearrangements detected by QMPSF were further analyzed by array comparative genomic hybridization. RESULTS: Overall, five patients had a heterozygous HNF1B deletion, presenting renal disease, elevated liver enzymes, and diabetes. Diabetes was characterized by insulin resistance and adolescent onset of hyperglycemia. Additionally, clinical features in some patients were pancreas dysplasia and exocrine insufficiency (two of five patients), genital defects (three of five), mental retardation (two of five), and eye abnormalities (coloboma, cataract in two of five). One case also had severe growth deficit combined with congenital cholestasis, and another case had common variable immune deficiency. All patients reported here had monoallelic loss of the entire HNF1B gene. Whole genome array comparative genomic hybridization confirmed a precurrent genomic deletion of approximately 1.3-1.7 Mb in size. CONCLUSION: The clinical data of our cases enlarge the wide spectrum of patients with HNF1B anomaly. The underlying molecular defect in all cases was a 1.3	to 1.7-Mb deletion, and paired, segmental duplications along with breakpoints were most likely involved in this recurrent chromosomal microdeletion.

TI	The role of genetic variation in the lamin a/c gene in the etiology of polycystic ovary syndrome.
PG	2665-9
AB	OBJECTIVE: We performed this study to test the hypothesis that variation in the lamin a/c gene (LMNA) contributes to milder phenotypes of insulin resistance, hyperandrogenism, and/or metabolic syndrome associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We resequenced the coding region, flanking intronic, and proximal promoter regions of the lamin a/c gene in 43 women with PCOS with evidence of upper-body obesity (waist circumference &gt;88 cm) and identified 56 variants, two of which were nonsynonymous substitutions (lmna11 exon1 E98D; lmna24 exon 7 R455C). We genotyped 53 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (44 identified through resequencing and nine included to maximize informativeness of the entire gene) in 624 index (PCOS) cases and 544 controls of European ancestry. We tested for association between these variants and PCOS. In a subset of individuals, we also tested for association with metabolic syndrome and quantitative traits (body mass index, waist circumference, total testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, fasting glucose and insulin, low-density lipoprotein, and total triglycerides). RESULTS: After correction for multiple testing, none of the variants showed significant evidence for association with PCOS, the metabolic syndrome, or any of the quantitative traits tested. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas these studies cannot exclude the role of genetic variation in the lamin a/c gene in isolated cases of PCOS, we can conclude that common variation in the lamin a/c gene does not contribute to the etiology of PCOS in women of European ancestry.

TI	An in-frame deletion in Kir6.2 (KCNJ11) causing neonatal diabetes reveals a site of interaction between Kir6.2 and SUR1.
PG	2551-7
AB	CONTEXT: Activating mutations in genes encoding the Kir6.2 (KCNJ11) and SUR1 (ABCC8) subunits of the pancreatic ATP-sensitive K(+) channel are a common cause of permanent neonatal diabetes (PNDM). All Kir6.2 mutations identified to date are missense mutations. We describe here a novel in-frame deletion (residues 28-32) in Kir6.2 in a heterozygous patient with PNDM without neurological problems that are detectable by standard evaluation. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to identify the mutation responsible for neonatal diabetes in this patient and characterize its functional effects. DESIGN: Wild-type and mutant Kir6.2/SUR1 channels were examined by heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes. RESULTS: The Kir6.2-28Delta32 mutation produced a significant decrease in ATP inhibition and an increase in whole-cell K(ATP) currents, explaining the diabetes of the patient. Tolbutamide block was only slightly reduced in the simulated heterozygous state, suggesting that the patient should respond to sulfonylurea therapy. The mutation decreased ATP inhibition indirectly, by increasing the intrinsic (unliganded) channel open probability. Neither effect was observed when Kir6.2 was expressed in the absence of SUR1, suggesting that the mutation impairs coupling between SUR1 and Kir6.2. Coimmunoprecipitation studies further revealed that the mutation disrupted a physical interaction between Kir6.2 and residues 1-288 (but not residues 1-196) of SUR1. CONCLUSIONS: We report a novel KCNJ11 mutation causing PNDM. Our results show that residues 28-32 in the N terminus of Kir6.2 interact both physically and functionally with SUR1 and suggest that residues 196-288 of SUR1 are important in this interaction.

TI	Single nucleotide transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene polymorphisms in antiislet autoantibody-negative patients at onset of diabetes.
PG	504-10
AB	CONTEXT: There is controversy as to whether type 2 diabetes genetic susceptibility contributes to type 1 diabetes, and it is not known what proportion of islet autoantibody-negative new onset subjects have type 2 diabetes risk alleles. OBJECTIVES: We designed this study to evaluate whether two type 2 diabetes-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene are associated with the development of islet autoantibody-negative diabetes vs. islet autoantibody-positive diabetes in young patients and whether these SNPs are associated with specific clinical phenotypes. DESIGN: Autoantibody against glutamic acid decarboxylase 65, islet cell antibody 512bdc (form of IA-2), insulin, ZnT8 transporter, and cytoplasmic islet cell antibody were assayed in patients with new onset diabetes seen at the Barbara Davis Center using sera obtained within 2 wk of diagnosis. We genotyped two noncoding variants in the TCF7L2 gene, rs12255372 and rs7903146, in diabetic subjects and normal controls. RESULTS: A total of 140 patients (15.7%) were negative for all islet autoantibodies among 893 subjects less than age 25 at the onset of diabetes. The allele and genotype frequencies of two SNPs showed that these are associated (odds ratio up to 4) with the development of diabetes in the autoantibody-negative diabetic cohort, but not in the autoantibody-positive diabetic cohort. CONCLUSION: TCF7L2 type 2 diabetes susceptibility alleles are associated with islet autoantibody-negative but not autoantibody-positive new onset diabetes in young patients.

TI	Recommendations for the diagnosis and management of Prader-Willi syndrome.
PG	4183-97
AB	OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to provide recommendations for the diagnosis and management of Prader-Willi syndrome throughout the life span to guide clinical practice. PARTICIPANTS: An open international multidisciplinary expert meeting was held in October 2006 in Toulouse, France, with 37 invited speakers and session chairs (see Acknowledgments) and 85 additional registered participants. The meeting was supported by an unrestricted educational grant from Pfizer. EVIDENCE: Invited participants with particular expertise reviewed the published evidence base for their specialist topic and unpublished data from personal experience, previous national and international PWS conferences, and PWS Association clinical advisory groups. Sessions covered epidemiology, psychiatric, and behavioral disorders; breathing and sleep abnormalities; genetics; endocrinology; and management in infancy, childhood, transition, and adulthood. CONSENSUS PROCESS: This included group meetings including open discussion after each session. The guidelines were written by the Scientific Committee (authors), using the conclusions provided by the sessions chairs and summary provided by each speaker, including incorporation of changes suggested after review by selected meeting participants (see Acknowledgments). CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis and management of this complex disorder requires a multidisciplinary approach with particular emphasis on the importance of early diagnosis using accredited genetic testing, use and monitoring of GH therapy from early childhood, control of the food environment and regular exercise, appropriate management of transition, consideration of group home placement in adulthood, and distinction of behavioral problems from psychiatric illness.

TI	Association of androgen receptor CAG repeat polymorphism and polycystic ovary syndrome.
PG	1939-45
AB	CONTEXT: Genetically determined heightened androgen sensitivity may influence the phenotype of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). To date, studies of the androgen receptor exon 1 polymorphic CAG repeat have produced conflicting results in PCOS. OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that a lower number of CAG repeats is associated with increased odds of PCOS. We also compared X-chromosome inactivation between cases and controls. DESIGN: Women with and without PCOS were genotyped for the CAG repeat and assessed for X-chromosome methylation. Association analyses were performed. SETTING: Subjects were recruited from the reproductive endocrinology clinic at the University of Alabama at Birmingham; controls were recruited from the surrounding community. Genotyping took place at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 330 women with PCOS and 289 controls (77% white, 23% black). MAIN MEASUREMENTS: Androgen receptor genotype, X-chromosome methylation, and phenotyping for PCOS were measured. RESULTS: A smaller biallelic mean of CAG repeats was associated with increased odds of PCOS. X-chromosome inactivation was not different comparing cases with controls; however, in the subset with nonrandom inactivation, the chromosome bearing the shorter CAG allele was preferentially active in PCOS women. CONCLUSIONS: Association of shorter CAG repeats with PCOS is consistent with in vitro functional studies demonstrating higher activity of androgen receptors expressed from alleles with fewer CAG repeats, suggesting inherited alteration in androgen sensitivity may contribute to PCOS. In some women, such heightened sensitivity may also result from preferential expression of androgen receptors with shorter alleles. Thus, genetic and epigenetic changes may be involved in the pathogenesis of PCOS.

TI	Origin of de novo KCNJ11 mutations and risk of neonatal diabetes for subsequent siblings.
PG	1773-7
AB	CONTEXT: Activating mutations in the KCNJ11 gene, which encodes the Kir6.2 subunit of the pancreatic beta-cell K(ATP) channel, result in permanent and transient neonatal diabetes. The majority of KCNJ11 mutations are spontaneous, but the parental origin of these mutations is not known. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine the parental origin of de novo KCNJ11 mutations and investigate the possibility of mosaicism in transmitting parents. DESIGN: We identified 68 index cases with a KCNJ11 mutation where neither parent was known to be affected. DNA was available from both parents of 41 probands. The parental origin of the mutation was determined in 18 families by examination of pedigrees, microsatellite analysis, or allele-specific PCR. RESULTS: A nonsignificant excess of paternally derived mutations was found with 13 of 18 (72%) shown to have arisen on the paternal allele. There was no evidence to suggest an association with increased age at conception. In two families, there were half-siblings with permanent neonatal diabetes born to an unaffected father, suggesting germline mosaicism that was confirmed by the presence of the R201C mutation in one father's semen. Somatic mosaicism was detected in one unaffected mother, and this mutation will also be present in her germ cells. CONCLUSION: De novo KCNJ11 mutations can arise either during gametogenesis or embryogenesis. The possibility of germline mosaicism means that future siblings are at increased risk of neonatal diabetes, and we recommend that molecular genetic testing is routinely offered at birth for subsequent siblings of children with de novo KCNJ11 mutations.

TI	Body mass index differences in pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a versus pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism may implicate paternal imprinting of Galpha(s) in the development of human obesity.
PG	1073-9
AB	CONTEXT: Obesity is a prominent feature of Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO), a disorder caused by heterozygous GNAS mutations that disrupt the stimulatory G protein alpha-subunit Galpha(s). Because Galpha(s) is paternally imprinted in certain hormone target tissues, maternal inheritance of AHO leads to multihormone resistance [pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a (PHP1a)], whereas paternal inheritance leads to AHO alone [pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism (pseudoPHP)]. Classically, the obesity in AHO is described as occurring similarly in both conditions. SETTING: This observational study was conducted at the General Clinical Research Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine; National Institutes of Health. PATIENTS: Fifty-three patients with AHO (40 with PHP1a and 13 with pseudoPHP) and two with progressive osseous heteroplasia were studied. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Main outcome measures were weight and height sd score (SDS), body mass index (BMI) percentiles, and BMI z-scores. RESULTS: Patients with PHP1a had significantly greater mean weight SDS, BMI percentages, and BMI z-scores compared with patients with pseudoPHP. These differences in BMI were secondary to adipose content based on dual energy x-ray absorptiometry analysis. The mean BMI z-score +/	sem for PHP1a was 2.31 +/	0.18 compared with 0.65 +/	0.31 in pseudoPHP (P = 0.000032). Twenty-five of 40 (62.5%) patients with PHP1a had mean BMI z-scores greater than two SDS above the mean, whereas no patients with pseudoPHP had BMI z-scores in this range. CONCLUSIONS: Although the AHO phenotype for PHP1a and pseudoPHP has been thought to be similar, we have found that obesity is a more prominent feature in PHP1a than in pseudoPHP and that severe obesity is characteristic of PHP1a specifically. These findings may implicate paternal imprinting of Galpha(s) in the development of human obesity.

TI	Epigenetic defects of GNAS in patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism and mild features of Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy.
PG	2370-3
AB	CONTEXT: Several endocrine disorders that share resistance to PTH are grouped under the term pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP). PHP type I, associated with blunted PTH-induced nephrogenous cAMP formation and phosphate excretion, is subdivided according to the presence or absence of additional endocrine abnormalities, Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO), and reduced Gsalpha activity caused by GNAS mutations. OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify the molecular defect in four unrelated patients who were thought to have PHP-Ia because of PTH and TSH resistance and mild AHO features. METHODS: Gsalpha activity and mutation analysis, and assessment of GNAS haplotype, methylation, and gene expression were performed for probands and family members. RESULTS: Two patients showed modest decreases in erythrocyte Gsalpha activity. Instead of Gsalpha point mutations, however, all four patients showed methylation defects of the GNAS locus, a feature previously described only for PHP-Ib. Furthermore, one patient with an isolated loss of GNAS exon A/B methylation had the 3-kb STX16 deletion frequently identified in PHP-Ib patients. In all but one of the remaining patients, haplotype analysis excluded large deletions or uniparental disomy as the cause of the observed methylation changes. CONCLUSIONS: Our investigations indicate that an overlap may exist between molecular and clinical features of PHP-Ia and PHP-Ib. No current mechanisms can explain the AHO-like features of our patients, some of which may not be linked to GNAS. Therefore, patients with hormone resistance and AHO-like features in whom coding Gsalpha mutations have been excluded should be evaluated for epigenetic alterations within GNAS.

TI	Insulin gene variable number of tandem repeats (INS VNTR) genotype and metabolic syndrome in childhood obesity.
PG	4641-4
AB	OBJECTIVE: The insulin variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism located in the insulin gene promoter (INS VNTR) has been associated with insulin levels in obese children. Hyperinsulinemia is a pivotal factor in the development of metabolic syndrome, an emerging complication in childhood obesity. With the present study, we aimed to test the associations between INS VNTR and the metabolic syndrome in juvenile-onset obesity. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We screened for the INS VNTR in 320 obese children (152 girls; mean age, 11.2 +/	2.3 yr; mean z-score body mass index, 3.6 +/	1.1). All of them underwent a standard oral glucose tolerance test; baseline measurements included blood pressure and plasma lipid and fasting insulin levels. By using the data derived from the oral glucose tolerance test, the whole-body insulin sensitivity and the insulinogenic index were calculated. RESULTS: The prevalence of metabolic syndrome reached 39%. No differences in INS VNTR genotype distribution were observed between obese subjects and 200 lean, age	and sex-matched children (P = 0.7). Among obese subjects, the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome was significantly higher in subjects with the I/I genotype (P = 0.006); the risk for developing the metabolic syndrome was significantly higher in subjects carrying the I/I genotype (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-3.9). Obese subjects homozygous for the class I allele showed higher insulin levels and insulinogenic index but lower whole-body insulin sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the I variant of the insulin promoter, when expressed in homozygotes, can predispose obese children to develop the metabolic syndrome.

TI	Interleukin-1 system gene polymorphisms are associated with fat mass in young men.
PG	2749-54
AB	CONTEXT: There is growing evidence for interactions between the regulation of body fat and the immune system. Studies of knockout mice indicate that IL-1 has an antiobesity effect. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to investigate our hypothesis that common polymorphisms of the IL-1 system, which are associated with IL-1 activity, also are associated with fat mass. DESIGN, SETTING, AND STUDY SUBJECTS: The Gothenburg Osteoporosis and Obesity Determinants (GOOD) study is a population-based cross-sectional study of 18	to 20-yr-old men (n = 1068), mostly Caucasian, from the Gothenburg area (Sweden). Three different polymorphisms, IL-1beta +3953 C/T, IL-1beta-31 T/C, and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RN) variable number tandem repeat of 86 bp, were investigated in relation to body fat mass. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The main outcome measures were genotype distributions and their association with body fat mass in different compartments, measured with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: Carriers of the T variant (CT and TT) of the +3953 C to T (F(T) = 0.25) IL-1beta gene polymorphism had significantly lower total fat mass (P = 0.013) and also significantly reduced arm, leg, and trunk fat, compared with CC individuals. IL-1RN*2 carriers with two repeats of the IL-1RN variable number tandem repeat polymorphism had increased total fat (P = 0.036), serum leptin, and fat of trunk and arm as well as serum levels of IL-1RN and IL-1RN production ex vivo. The IL-1beta-31 polymorphism did not correlate with the fat measurements. CONCLUSIONS: The IL-1 system, recently shown to affect fat mass in experimental animals, contains gene polymorphisms that are associated with fat mass in young men.

TI	The insulin gene variable number of tandem repeat: associations and interactions with childhood body fat mass and insulin secretion in normal children.
PG	2770-5
AB	CONTEXT: Polymorphism at the insulin gene (INS) variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) shows variable associations with childhood body mass index (BMI) in different populations. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to observe INS VNTR associations with body composition and insulin secretion in children. DESIGN: The study was designed as a prospective birth cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 947 children genotyped for the INS VNTR participated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Main outcome measures were whole body dual x-ray emission absorptiometry at 9 yr to estimate height-corrected fat mass index (FMI), truncal FMI, and fat-free mass, and insulin secretion after oral glucose at 8 yr. RESULTS: Homozygous III/III children had higher BMI (P = 0.020), FMI (P = 0.015), and truncal FMI (P = 0.022) at 9 yr than class I bearers, but no difference in fat-free mass (P = 0.23). Gain in weight sd score between birth and 3 yr was associated positively with BMI, FMI, and truncal FMI in class I bearers, but not in III/III children (p-interaction with genotype = 0.009-0.066). INS VNTR genotype was not associated overall with insulin secretion at 8 yr (P = 0.64), but class I bearers showed a stronger positive correlation between insulin secretion and BMI at 8 yr (regression coefficient +/	se, 0.26 +/	0.05; P &lt; 0.0001) than III/III children (-0.10 +/	0.07; P = 0.48) (p-interaction = 0.003). CONCLUSION: We clarified that the overall association between INS VNTR class III/III genotype and larger BMI in this population relates to fat mass, but not fat-free mass. In contrast, among the subgroup of children who showed rapid infancy weight gain, class I bearers tended to have larger BMI and fat mass than III/III children. This genetic interaction could relate to insulin secretion, which, in class I bearers, increased more rapidly with overweight and obesity.

TI	The C42R mutation in the Kir6.2 (KCNJ11) gene as a cause of transient neonatal diabetes, childhood diabetes, or later-onset, apparently type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG	3174-8
AB	CONTEXT: Known genes in maturity-onset diabetes of the young account for only a fraction of families with dominantly inherited diabetes in Japan. There should be as-yet-unidentified genes that account for the rest of the patients. OBJECTIVE: To identify and characterize the mutation responsible for a Japanese family with dominantly inherited diabetes mellitus. SUBJECTS: Members of a four-generation family with dominantly inherited diabetes mellitus observed in three generations. None of the patients in this family had permanent neonatal diabetes. One had transient neonatal diabetes, one had childhood diabetes, and the others had adult-onset diabetes without autoantibodies or insulin resistance. METHODS: Screening of the chromosomal location of the gene by a genome-wide linkage analysis followed by candidate gene sequencing. Confirmation of the functional significance of the identified mutation by the population survey and the physiological analysis. RESULTS: We identified a novel mutation (C42R) in the KCNJ11 gene coding for the Kir6.2 subunit of the pancreatic ATP-sensitive potassium channel. The patch-clamp experiments using the mutated KCNJ11 showed that the mutation causes increased spontaneous open probability and reduced ATP sensitivity. The effect, however, was partially compensated by the reduction of functional ATP-sensitive potassium channel expression at the cell surface, which could account for the milder phenotype of our patients. CONCLUSIONS: These results broaden the spectrum of diabetes phenotypes caused by mutations of KCNJ11 and suggest that mutations in this gene should be taken into consideration for not only permanent neonatal diabetes but also other forms of diabetes with milder phenotypes and later onset.

TI	The insulin gene variable number tandem repeat and risk of type 2 diabetes in a population-based sample of families and unrelated men and women.
PG	1137-43
AB	Abnormalities in insulin regulation are central to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. We assessed variation in the insulin gene variable number tandem repeat (INS VNTR) minisatellite (using the -23Hph1 A/T single nucleotide polymorphism) as a risk factor for 92 cases of incident type 2 diabetes in 883 unrelated Framingham Heart Study (FHS) subjects and in a separate sample of 698 members of 282 FHS nuclear families with 62 diabetes cases. In the unrelated sample, the -23Hph1 TT genotype frequency was 8.0% and was associated with a diabetes hazard ratio of 1.89 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01-3.52; P = 0.045] compared with the AA genotype using diabetes age of onset as the time failure variable in a proportional hazards model adjusted for age, offspring sex, body mass index, parental diabetes, and sex by parental diabetes interactions. In sex-stratified analyses, TT increased risk for diabetes in women (hazard ratio, 4.25; 95% CI, 1.76-10.3), but not men (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.39-2.60). Using a family-based association test to assess transmission disequilibrium in the sample of related subjects, the age	and sex-adjusted z-score for diabetes associated with the T allele was 2.07 (P = 0.04), and a family-based association test using age of onset in a proportional hazards model was also statistically significant (P = 0.03), indicating that increased risk of diabetes was not attributable to population admixture. These data support the hypothesis that the INS VNTR is a genetic risk factor for type 2 diabetes, with the TT genotype accounting for about 6.6% of cases in the FHS population.

TI	The effects of the ACE gene insertion/deletion polymorphism on glucose tolerance and insulin secretion in elderly people are modified by birth weight.
PG	5738-41
AB	The I allele of an insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism in the angiotensin-converting enzyme gene (ACE) appears to be protective against the complications of type 2 diabetes. Low birth weight, a marker of an adverse intrauterine environment, is associated with higher rates of type 2 diabetes. We examined whether the ACE I/D polymorphism could explain or modify the association between low birth weight and adulthood glucose tolerance. We measured plasma glucose and insulin concentrations after an oral glucose challenge in a group of 423 men and women, ages 65-75 yr, with measurements at birth recorded. The presence of the I allele was associated with shorter duration of gestation (P = 0.006) and, relative to gestational age, higher birth weight (P = 0.008) and length (P = 0.02). The I allele was associated with lower glucose at 120 min (P = 0.04) and a greater insulin response (P = 0.03 for insulin at 30 min and P = 0.06 for insulin area under the curve) to a standard oral glucose tolerance test. However, the associations between the ACE genotype and adulthood insulin secretion were only present in people with low birth weight (P for interaction birth weight * ACE genotype on insulin at 30 min = 0.003 and on insulin area under the curve = 0.05). The ACE I allele is associated with shorter duration of gestation and higher birth weight. The association between the presence of the ACE I allele and increased indices of adult insulin secretion is confined to subjects with low birth weight. We suggest that these findings reflect interactions between genotype and intrauterine environment with resulting changes in gene expression.

TI	The insulin-like growth factor-II receptor gene is associated with type 1 diabetes: evidence of a maternal effect.
PG	5700-6
AB	Susceptibility to type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a complex trait, involving several loci. One of these putative loci, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus-8 (IDDM8) at 6q, has been found to be subject to parental effects, suggesting the involvement of an imprinted gene. IGF-II receptor (IGF2R), the best-studied imprinted gene in the IDDM8 region, encodes the IGF-2 receptor, a protein involved in many biological processes, including immune function and beta-cell regeneration. Mice express only the maternal allele. In humans, the molecular IGF2R imprint (maternal-specific methylation) is present, but it affects expression in only a small subset of individuals. To examine whether IGF2R might contribute to the IDDM8 effect, we examined transmission distortion at several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 404 parent-offspring trios. After correcting for multiple testing, significant distortion was found at only one silent SNP on exon 16 (P = 0.002). SNPs upstream and downstream showed weak linkage disequilibrium and no transmission distortion, localizing the association to a 53-kb block within IGF2R. Interestingly, the exon 16 SNP association was limited to maternally inherited alleles. SLC22A2 and SLC22A3, two genes downstream of IGF2R that are imprinted in the mouse, showed no T1D association. Thus, we present evidence that maternal alleles at an IGF2R polymorphism are associated with T1D. It is thus possible that at some tissue or developmental stage not yet examined, IGF2R is universally imprinted.

TI	Variation in the calpain-10 gene is associated with elevated triglyceride levels and reduced adipose tissue messenger ribonucleic acid expression in obese Swedish subjects.
PG	3601-5
AB	Our aim was to investigate the possible role of the type 2 diabetes susceptibility gene CAPN10 in obesity. A case control study consisting of 235 obese Swedish subjects [body mass index, 40 (35-45) kg/m(2)] and 235 controls matched for age and gender [body mass index, 22 (21-24) kg/m(2)], and a transmission disequilibrium test consisting of 116 parents-offspring trios, where the offspring was abdominally obese [waist, 100 (95-110) cm], were performed. CAPN10 mRNA expression was studied in adipose tissue biopsies from 33 of the obese subjects participating in the case control study. The CAPN10 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-43 was genotyped using PCR followed by NdeI digestion or by allelic discrimination. CAPN10 mRNA levels were quantified using real-time RT-PCR with Cyclophilin A as an internal standard. No significant associations between CAPN10 SNP-43 and obesity were seen, neither in the case control study nor in the transmission disequilibrium test, but obese subjects homozygous for the SNP-43 G allele had significantly elevated triglyceride levels compared with subjects carrying the A allele [1.7 (1.1-2.4) vs. 1.4 (1.0-2.0); P = 0.03]. The CAPN10 mRNA expression in sc fat was significantly reduced in subjects with the SNP-43 G/G genotype compared with carriers of SNP-43 G/A (G/G, 0.33 +/	0.02, vs. G/A, 0.51 +/	0.09; P = 0.048), and a similar trend was observed in visceral fat (G/G, 0.52 +/	0.06, vs. G/A, 0.65 +/	0.10; P = 0.22). Our data suggest that reduced CAPN10 expression may be a risk factor for features associated with the metabolic syndrome in obese subjects, although variation in the gene does not seem to contribute to the risk for developing obesity per se.

TI	Lack of support for a role of the insulin gene variable number of tandem repeats minisatellite (INS-VNTR) locus in fetal growth or type 2 diabetes-related intermediate traits in United Kingdom populations.
PG	310-7
AB	The insulin gene variable number of tandem repeats minisatellite (INS-VNTR) class III allele is associated with altered fetal growth, type 2 diabetes risk (especially when paternally inherited), and insulin and IGF2 gene expression. Further studies are needed to establish the role of the INS-VNTR in fetal growth and assess whether its effects depend on the parent of origin. We analyzed the INS-VNTR-linked -23 Hph1 polymorphism in 2283 subjects, comprising 1184 children and 1099 parents. There were no differences (P &lt; 0.05) in birth weight between offspring of the three genotypes: III/III (n = 108) vs. I/I (n = 558), effect size, -8 g (P = 0.87); and I/III (n = 464) vs. I/I, effect size, -19 g (P = 0.54). We observed no differences in head circumference [III/III (n = 95) vs. I/I (n = 470), effect size, -0.14 cm; P = 0.31] or birth length. No differences were observed when stratifying by postnatal growth realignments [nonchangers III/III (n = 37) vs. I/I (n = 170), effect size, -43 g; P = 1.00] or by parent of origin of the class III allele (presence of paternal III allele effect size, -15 g; P = 0.74). INS-VNTR was nominally associated (P &lt; 0.05) with body mass index and insulin resistance, but not with beta-cell function, in young adults. In the largest study to date, we found a lack of support for a role for INS-VNTR in fetal growth and nominal association with type 2 diabetes-related intermediate traits.

TI	The Arg972 variant in insulin receptor substrate-1 is associated with an atherogenic profile in offspring of type 2 diabetic patients.
PG	3368-71
AB	The insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) gene has been considered a candidate for insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and coronary artery disease. To investigate the relationship between the common Gly(972)Arg IRS-1 variant and the presence of cardiovascular risk factors, 153 glucose-tolerant, unrelated offspring of type 2 diabetic patients were studied. There were no differences between Arg(972) IRS-1 carriers and noncarriers in age, gender, body mass index, waist/hip ratio, body composition, fasting glucose and insulin levels, and glucose or insulin levels during the oral glucose tolerance test. Insulin sensitivity, assessed by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, was significantly reduced in carriers of Arg(972) IRS-1 (P &lt; 0.03). Carriers of Arg(972) IRS-1 displayed many features of the insulin resistance syndrome, including higher values for serum triglycerides (P &lt; 0.01), total/high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (P &lt; 0.01), free fatty acid levels (P &lt; 0.04), systolic blood pressure (P &lt; 0.04), microalbuminuria (P &lt; 0.003), and intima-media thickness (P &lt; 0.02). These results suggest that the Arg(972) IRS-1 variant could contribute to the risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases associated with type 2 diabetes by producing a cluster of insulin resistance-related metabolic abnormalities.

TI	Polymorphism in the IGF-I gene: clinical relevance for short children born small for gestational age (SGA).
PG	2720
AB	Low birth weight is associated with an increased risk in adult life of type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The fetal insulin hypothesis postulates that genes involving insulin resistance could effect birth weight and disease in later life (Hattersley, 1999). Besides insulin, there is extensive evidence that insulin-like growth factor-I and -II (IGF-I, IGF-II) play an important role in fetal growth. We hypothesized that minor genetic variation in the IGF-I gene could influence pre	and postnatal growth. Three microsatellite markers located in the IGF-I gene in 124 short children (height &lt; -1.88 SDS) who were born small for gestational age (SGA) and their parents were studied. SGA was defined as both a birth weight and birth length below -1.88 SDS for gestational age. Two polymorphic markers showed transmission disequilibrium. Allele 191 of the IGF1.PCR1 marker was transmitted more frequently from parent to child (chi(2) = 4.8 and p = 0.02) and allele 198 of the 737/738 marker was transmitted less frequently from parent to child (chi(2)= 4.5 and p = 0.03). Children carrying the 191-allele had significantly lower IGF-1 levels than children not carrying this allele (-1.1 SDS vs. -0.05 SDS; p = 0.03). Also, head circumference SDS remained smaller in children with allele 191 compared to children without allele 191 (-2.1 SDS vs. -0.9 SDS; p = 0.003). Our results show that genetically determined low IGF-I levels may lead to a reduction in birth weight, length and head circumference and to persistent short stature and small head circumference in later life (proportionate small). Since low IGF-I levels are associated with type 2 diabetes and CVD, we propose that the IGF-I gene may provide a link between low birth weight and such diseases in later life.

TI	Ghrelin gene: identification of missense variants and a frameshift mutation in extremely obese children and adolescents and healthy normal weight students.
PG	2716
AB	Ghrelin induces obesity via central and peripheral mechanisms. Administration of ghrelin leads to increased food intake and decreased fat utilisation in rodents. Ghrelin levels are decreased in obese individuals. Recently, a polymorphism (Arg-51-Gln) within the ghrelin gene (GHRL) was described to be associated with obesity. We screened the GHRL coding region in 215 extremely obese German Children and adolescents (study group 1) and 93 normal weight students (study group 2) by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP). We found the two previously described single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP: Arg-51-Gln and Leu-72-Met) in similar frequencies in study groups 1 and 2 (allele frequencies were: 0.019 and 0.016 for the 51-Gln allele and 0.091 and 0.086 for the 72-Met allele, respectively). Hence, we could not confirm the previous finding. Additionally, two novel variants were identified within the coding region: (1) We detected one healthy normal weight individual with a frameshift mutation (2bp deletion at codon 34). This frameshift mutation affects the coding region of the mature ghrelin. Hence, it is highly likely that the normal weight student is haplo-insufficient for ghrelin. (2) An A to T transversion leads to an amino acid exchange from Gln to Leu at amino acid position 90. The frequency of the 90-Leu allele was significantly higher in the extremely obese children and adolescents (0.063) than in the normal weight students (0.016; nominal p = 0.011). Additionally, we genotyped 134 underweight students and 44 normal weight adults for this SNP. Genotype frequencies were similar in extremely obese children and adolescents, underweight students and normal weight adults (p &gt; 0.8). In conclusion, we identified four sequence variants in the coding region of the ghrelin gene in individuals belonging to different weight extremes. A frameshift mutation was detected in a normal weight individual. None of the variants seem to influence weight regulation.

TI	Class III alleles of the variable number of tandem repeat insulin polymorphism associated with silencing of thymic insulin predispose to type 1 diabetes.
PG	3705-10
AB	Type 1 diabetes results from autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells. The insulin gene (INS) is also expressed in human thymus, an ectopic expression site likely involved in immune tolerance. The IDDM2 diabetes susceptibility locus maps to a minisatellite composed of a variable number of tandem repeats situated 0.5 kb upstream of INS. Chromosomes carrying the protective long INS variable number of tandem repeats alleles (class III) produce higher levels of thymic INS mRNA than those with the predisposing, short class I alleles. However, complete silencing of thymic INS transcripts from the class III chromosome was found in a small proportion of heterozygous human thymus samples. We hypothesized that the specific class III alleles found on these chromosomes silence rather than enhance thymic insulin expression. To test the prediction that these alleles are predisposing, we developed a DNA fingerprinting method for detecting two putative &quot;silencing&quot; alleles found in two thymus samples (S1, S2). In a set of 287 diabetic children and their parents we found 13 alleles matching the fingerprint of the S1 or S2 alleles. Of 18 possible transmissions, 12 of the S1-S2 alleles were transmitted to the diabetic offspring, a frequency of 0.67, significantly higher than the 0.38 seen in the remaining 142 class III alleles; P = 0.025. This confirms our prediction and represents an additional level of correlation between thymic insulin and diabetes susceptibility, which supports a thymic enhancer effect of the INS variable number of tandem repeats as the mechanism of IDDM2 and refines the contribution of IDDM2 genotyping to diabetes risk assessment.

TI	Alterations in the p16INK4a/CDKN2A tumor suppressor gene in gastrinomas.
PG	4146-56
AB	The p16INK4a/CDKN2A gene (p16INK4a) is frequently altered by homozygous deletion, mutation, or methylation in many nonendocrine tumors, and these alterations may be predictive of recurrence, tumor growth, or aggressiveness. Whether this is true of neuroendocrine tumors such as gastrinomas is unclear. To address this question we analyzed the gastrinomas from 44 patients for p16INK4a gene mutations and correlated the results to the tumor's biological behavior, growth pattern, and aggressiveness. No gastrinomas had mutations of exon 1 or exon 2 of the p16INK4a gene, although polymorphisms were found in 54%. No homozygous deletions were found. In 52% of the gastrinomas, hypermethylation of a 5'-CpG island of the p16INK4a gene promoter was found. To assess the growth behavior of the gastrinomas, all patients were assessed yearly with at least three conventional imaging studies (computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound), and since 1994 have been assessed with radionuclide scanning using [111In-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid,DPhe1]octreotide. The mean follow-up was 5.1+/-0.4 yr (range, 1.2-11.7). The presence or absence of methylation of the p16INK4a gene did not correlate with clinical characteristics of the gastrinoma, biological behavior (gastrin release and basal or maximal acid output), the presence or absence of known prognostic factors (tumor size, gastrinoma location, lymph node metastases, liver metastases, and curability), or growth pattern of the gastrinoma postresection. These results indicate that methylation of the p16INK4a gene is the most common gene alteration described to date in gastrinomas. Furthermore, because it is independent of disease stage it is probably an early event in the pathogenesis and because it is independent of the primary gastrinoma location, which is now thought to have different origins, methylation of the p16INK4a gene is probably a central process in the molecular pathogenesis of these tumors.

TI	Variability of the insulin receptor substrate-1, hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha), HNF-4alpha, and HNF-6 genes and size at birth in a population-based sample of young Danish subjects.
PG	2951-3
AB	Reduced size at birth has been proposed to be a risk factor for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. It is, however, not known whether this association is explained by unfavorable intrauterine environment or by specific susceptibility genotypes predisposing for both reduced fetal growth and insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. The present study was performed to evaluate whether previously identified amino acid polymorphisms of genes that from animal models have been suggested to play important roles during fetal development are associated with alterations in size at birth. The study population comprised 380 subjects randomly recruited from a population of young Danish Caucasian individuals, aged 18-32 yr. The original data of birth length and weight for 331 of 380 subjects were obtained from the midwife records. The Gly/Arg972 of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), the Thr/Ile130 of the hepatocyte nuclear factor-4alpha (HNF-4alpha), the Pro/Ala75 of HNF-6, and the Ile/Leu27, Ala/Val93, and Ser/Asn4s7 polymorphisms of the HNF-lalpha gene were examined for association with birth weight and length and the ponderal index. Using a generalized linear model, including gender and the genotype as fixed variables, and applying Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, we could not demonstrate any significant differences in these estimates among wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous carriers with respect to any of the gene variants. In conclusion, common variability in the genes encoding the IRS-1, HNF-lalpha, HNF-4alpha, and HNF-6 proteins can be excluded as major factors influencing size at birth among Danish Caucasian subjects.

TI	The -238 and -308 G--&gt;A polymorphisms of the tumor necrosis factor alpha gene promoter are not associated with features of the insulin resistance syndrome or altered birth weight in Danish Caucasians.
PG	1731-4
AB	Recently, two G--&gt;A polymorphisms at positions -308 and -238, in the promoter of the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) gene, have been identified. These variants have, in different ethnic groups, been linked to estimates of insulin resistance and obesity. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether these genetic variants of TNF-alpha were associated with features of the insulin resistance syndrome or alterations in birth weight in two Danish study populations comprising 380 unrelated young healthy subjects and 249 glucose-tolerant relatives of type 2 diabetic patients, respectively. All study participants underwent an iv glucose tolerance test with the addition of tolbutamide after 20 min. In addition, a number of biochemical and anthropometric measures were performed on each subject. The subjects were genotyped for the polymorphisms by applying PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism. Neither of the variants was related to altered insulin sensitivity index or other features of the insulin resistance syndrome (body mass index, waist to hip ratio, fat mass, fasting serum lipids or fasting serum insulin or C-peptide). Birth weight and the ponderal index were also not associated with the polymorphisms. In conclusion, although the study was carried out on sufficiently large study samples, the study does not support a major role of the -308 or -238 substitutions of the TNF-alpha gene in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance or altered birth weight among Danish Caucasian subjects.

TI	Lack of association of the vascular endothelial growth factor gene polymorphisms with Kawasaki disease in Taiwanese children.
PG	322-8
AB	INTRODUCTION: Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute febrile vasculitis of unknown etiology that mainly occurs in infants and children. Clinical and histopathologic findings suggest that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is involved in the coronary artery lesions (CALs) development in KD. This study hypothesized that specific VEGF gene polymorphisms and their haplotypes are associated with KD susceptibility and CAL development in Taiwanese children. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The VEGF -2578 A/C, -634 G/C, and +936 C/T single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 156 children with KD and 672 ethnically matched healthy controls using the Pre-Developed TaqMan Allelic Discrimination Assay. RESULTS: No significant differences in genotype, allele, carrier, and haplotype frequencies of the three SNPs were found between healthy controls and children with KD or between patients with and without CAL. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that VEGF -2578 A/C, -634 G/C, and +936 C/T SNPs do not confer increased susceptibility to KD or to CAL development.

TI	Disruption of the histone acetyltransferase MYST4 leads to a Noonan syndrome-like phenotype and hyperactivated MAPK signaling in humans and mice.
PG	3479-91
LID	10.1172/JCI43428 [doi]
LID	43428 [pii]
AB	Epigenetic regulation of gene expression, through covalent modification of histones, is a key process controlling growth and development. Accordingly, the transcription factors regulating these processes are important targets of genetic diseases. However, surprisingly little is known about the relationship between aberrant epigenetic states, the cellular process affected, and their phenotypic consequences. By chromosomal breakpoint mapping in a patient with a Noonan syndrome-like phenotype that encompassed short stature, blepharoptosis, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, we identified haploinsufficiency of the histone acetyltransferase gene MYST histone acetyltransferase (monocytic leukemia) 4 (MYST4), as the underlying cause of the phenotype. Using acetylation, whole genome expression, and ChIP studies in cells from the patient, cell lines in which MYST4 expression was knocked down using siRNA, and the Myst4 querkopf mouse, we found that H3 acetylation is important for neural, craniofacial, and skeletal morphogenesis, mainly through its ability to specifically regulating the MAPK signaling pathway. This finding further elucidates the complex role of histone modifications in mammalian development and adds what we believe to be a new mechanism to the pathogenic phenotypes resulting from misregulation of the RAS signaling pathway.

TI	Seven mutations in the human insulin gene linked to permanent neonatal/infancy-onset diabetes mellitus.
PG	2148-56
AB	Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM) is a rare disorder usually presenting within 6 months of birth. Although several genes have been linked to this disorder, in almost half the cases documented in Italy, the genetic cause remains unknown. Because the Akita mouse bearing a mutation in the Ins2 gene exhibits PNDM associated with pancreatic beta cell apoptosis, we sequenced the human insulin gene in PNDM subjects with unidentified mutations. We discovered 7 heterozygous mutations in 10 unrelated probands. In 8 of these patients, insulin secretion was detectable at diabetes onset, but rapidly declined over time. When these mutant proinsulins were expressed in HEK293 cells, we observed defects in insulin protein folding and secretion. In these experiments, expression of the mutant proinsulins was also associated with increased Grp78 protein expression and XBP1 mRNA splicing, 2 markers of endoplasmic reticulum stress, and with increased apoptosis. Similarly transfected INS-1E insulinoma cells had diminished viability compared with those expressing WT proinsulin. In conclusion, we find that mutations in the insulin gene that promote proinsulin misfolding may cause PNDM.

TI	Imprinting of female offspring with testosterone results in insulin resistance and changes in body fat distribution at adult age in rats.
PG	74-8
AB	In women, a relative hyperandrogenicity is statistically associated with insulin resistance and centralization of body fat, which are predictors for the development of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of androgenization of newborn female rats on insulin sensitivity at adult age. To mimic the neonatal androgen peak normally observed in male rats, female pups were administered one high dose of testosterone (T) subcutaneously within 3 h after birth. They were then given back to their mothers and followed to adult age. At the end of the week 9, tail samples were taken, showing no differences in fasting plasma concentrations of glucose, lactate, insulin, or free fatty acids between T-treated rats and controls. Plasma concentrations of T and progesterone were significantly lower in the T-treated rats, whereas no differences were found in the levels of corticosterone, estradiol, insulin-like growth factor I, or ACTH. After 10 wk, insulin sensitivity was studied with hyperglycemic and euglycemic hyperinsulinemic (5 mU insulin/kg/min) clamp techniques. The T-treated rats showed insulin resistance with both techniques, which was overcome with time and increasing insulin concentrations during the clamp measurements. The T-treated rats were also heavier and had increased relative weights of skeletal muscles and the spleen. Parametrial, retroperitoneal, and inguinal adipose tissues decreased in weight while mesenteric adipose tissue tended to increase, resulting in an approximately 30-50% larger mesenteric than other adipose tissues. It is concluded that neonatal T imprinting of female rats is followed by insulin resistance, changes in adipose tissue distribution, and an enlarged lean mass, without elevation of circulating T. Similar changes are seen in adult female rats or women receiving T.

TI	Linkage between obesity and a marker near the tumor necrosis factor-alpha locus in Pima Indians.
PG	158-62
AB	Because tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) expression is increased in adipose tissue of both rodent models of obesity and obese humans, it has been considered as a candidate gene for obesity. Pima Indians were scored for genotypes at three polymorphic dinucleotide repeat loci (markers) near the gene TNF-alpha at 6p21.3. In a sib-pair linkage analysis, percent body fat, as measured by hydrostatic weighing, was linked (304 sib-pairs, P = 0.002) to the marker closest (10 kb) to TNF-alpha. The same marker was associated (P = 0.01) by analysis of variance with BMI. To search for possible DNA variants in TNF-alpha that contribute to obesity, single stranded conformational polymorphism analysis was performed from 20 obese and 20 lean subjects. Primer pairs were designed for the entire TNF-alpha protein coding region and part of the promoter. Only a single polymorphism located in the promoter region was detected. No association could be demonstrated between alleles at this polymorphism and percent body fat. We conclude that the linkage of TNF-alpha to obesity might be due to a sequence variant undetected in TNF-alpha or due to a variant in some other closely linked gene.

TI	High receptor binding affinity of lipoproteins in atypical dysbetalipoproteinemia (type III hyperlipoproteinemia).
PG	1906-15
AB	Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (or type III hyperlipoproteinemia) is characterized by the presence of abnormal, cholesteryl ester-rich beta-very low density lipoproteins (beta-VLDL) in the plasma. Subjects with typical dysbetalipoproteinemia are homozygous for an amino acid substitution in apolipoprotein (apo-) E at residue 158 and have defective apo-E-mediated binding of both pre-beta-VLDL and beta-VLDL to apo-B,E(LDL) (or LDL) receptors (1988. Chappell, D.A., J. Clin. Invest. 82:628-639). To understand the effect of substitutions in apo-E at sites other than residue 158, nine dysbetalipoproteinemic (dys-beta) subjects who were either homozygous or heterozygous for substitutions in apo-E at atypical sites were studied. These substitutions occurred at residue 142 (n = 6), 145 (n = 2), or 146 (n = 1) and are known to cause less defective binding than does the 158 substitution. The chemical composition and electrophoretic mobility of pre-beta-VLDL and beta-VLDL from atypical and typical dys-beta subjects were indistinguishable. However, lipoproteins from atypical and typical dys-beta subjects differed in their affinity for the apo-B,E(LDL) receptor on cultured human fibroblasts. The pre-beta-VLDL and beta-VLDL from atypical dys-beta subjects had 640	or 17-fold higher affinity, respectively, than did corresponding lipoproteins from typical dys-beta subjects. The higher binding affinity of lipoproteins from atypical dys-beta subjects was associated with a higher ratio of apo-E to total apo-C. Since higher binding affinity should cause more rapid receptor-mediated clearance of beta-VLDL in atypical than in typical dys-beta subjects in vivo, the mechanism of beta-VLDL accumulation may differ in these two groups.

TI	Genetic factors underlying the risk of thalidomide-related neuropathy in patients with multiple myeloma.
PG	797-804
AB	PURPOSE: To indentify genetic variation that can modulate and predict the risk of developing thalidomide-related peripheral neuropathy (TrPN). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed DNA from 1,495 patients with multiple myeloma. Using a custom-built single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, we tested the association of TrPN with 3,404 SNPs. The SNPs were selected in predicted functional regions within 964 genes spanning 67 molecular pathways thought to be involved in the pathogenesis, treatment response, and adverse effects associated with myeloma and its therapy. Patient cases and controls were derived from two large clinical trials that compared thalidomide with conventional-based treatment in myeloma patients (Medical Research Council Myeloma-IX and HOVON-50/GMMG-HD3). RESULTS: We report TrPN associations with SNPs-ABCA1 (rs363717), ICAM1 (rs1799969), PPARD (rs2076169), SERPINB2 (rs6103), and SLC12A6 (rs7164902)-where we show cross validation of the associations in both trials. To investigate whether TrPN SNP associations were related to exposure to thalidomide only or general drug-related peripheral neuropathy, we performed a second analysis on patients treated with vincristine. We report SNPs associated with vincristine neuropathy, with a seemingly distinct underlying genetic mechanism. CONCLUSION: Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that an individual's risk of developing a peripheral neuropathy after thalidomide treatment can be mediated by polymorphisms in genes governing repair mechanisms and inflammation in the peripheral nervous system. These findings will contribute to the development of future neuroprotective strategies with thalidomide therapy and the better use of this important compound.

TI	Angiotensinogen gene T235 variant: a marker for the development of persistent microalbuminuria in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus.
PG	191-8
AB	AIM: We examined genetic polymorphisms in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) coding for angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion (I/D) for angiotensinogen (AGT) M235T and angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AGTR1) A1166C as predictors for the development of microalbuminuria (MA) in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). METHODS: Four hundred fifty-three (215 males, 238 females) T1DM children [median (interquartile range): age, 16.7 years (13.9-18.3); diabetes duration, 6.9 years (3.3-10.8); age at diagnosis, 9.1 years (5.8-11.8)] were followed prospectively from diagnosis until the development of MA (two of three consecutive overnight urine samples with albumin excretion rates of &gt; or =20 and &lt;200 microg/min). Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional multivariate model estimated the probability of developing MA and the relative risk for MA among different variables. RESULTS: MA developed in 41 (9.1%) subjects. The frequencies of genotypes were as follows: ACE-II 112 (25%), ACE-ID 221 (49%), and ACE-DD 117 (26%) (n=450); AGT-MM 144 (32%), AGT-MT 231 (51%), and AGT-TT 77 (17%) (n=452); AGTR1-AA 211 (47%), AGTR1-AC 204 (45%), and AGTR1-CC 37 (8%) (n=452). The cumulative risk for the development of MA was higher in ACE-DD versus ACE-ID/II groups (log-rank test, P=.05), and a trend was noticed when AGT-TT was compared to AGT-MT/MM groups (log-rank test, P=.08). AGT-TT polymorphism conferred a fourfold increased risk for MA compared to AGT-MM/MT (hazard ratio=3.8; 95% confidence interval=1.43-10.3; P=.008). INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that RAS gene polymorphism at AGT M235T is a strong predictor for early MA in young T1DM subjects.

We performed a case-control study to determine if VEGF-2578C--&gt;A, VEGF-1499C--&gt;T, and VEGF-635G--&gt;C single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the VEGF gene are associated with predisposition to diabetic nephropathy in type 1 diabetes. Genomic DNA was obtained from Irish type 1 diabetic individuals with nephropathy (cases, n=242) and those without nephropathy (controls, n=301), in addition to 400 healthy control samples. These samples were genotyped for the three SNPs using TaqMan or Pyrosequencing technology. Chi-squared analyses revealed no significant differences in genotype or allele frequencies in cases versus controls for VEGF-2578C--&gt;A (genotype, P=.58; allele, P=.52) and VEGF-635G--&gt;C (genotype, P=.58; allele, P=.33). However, a positive association with diabetic nephropathy was observed for the VEGF-1499T allele in the Northern Ireland population (P &lt;.001) and subsequently replicated in a separate population from the Republic of Ireland (P &lt;.001; combined, P &lt;.001). Carriage of the VEGF-1499T allele was associated with a twofold excess risk of developing diabetic nephropathy (OR=2.24, 95% CI=1.50-3.36, P &lt;.0001). No significant differences were found between the healthy control population and the type 1 diabetic population. Our results suggest that the VEGF-1499T allele, or an allele in linkage disequilibrium with this allele, is associated with susceptibility to diabetic nephropathy in the Irish population.

TI	The insulin gene variable number of tandemrepeats (INS VNTR)  genotype and sleep disordered breathing in childhood obesity.
PG	752-5
AB	Aim of our study is to verify the association between the genetic predisposition to hyperinsulinism due to the presence of the insulin gene (INS) I/I genotype and the development of sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD) in obese children and adolescents. Two hundred and fifty-six obese children and adolescents (125 girls) have been investigated. As initial screening all subjects' mothers filled out the Sleep Disturbances Scale for Children (SDSC). The Sleep-Disordered Breathing (SDB) scale has been taken into account. Successively, a subgroup of 34 patients belonging to the first (14 children) and the last (20 children) SDB score quintiles underwent an overnight polysomnography and the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was evaluated. All subjects were genotyped for the INS VNTR and fasting insulin levels were evaluated. The population was divided into two groups according to the genotype: the first group was comprehensive of patients homozygotes for class I allele and the second group was composed by class III allele heterozygotes and homozygotes patients. Subjects I/I showed statistically signifIcant higher insulin levels (p&lt;0.001) and SDB scores (p&lt;0.001). Moreover, in the subgroup of patients investigated with polysomnography, class I homozygous subjects showed higher AHI compared to those patients carrying class III allele (p&lt;0.001). Our data support the hypothesis that INS VNTR is associated with the development of SDB among obese children and adolescents.

TI	Referral diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome based on methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction.
PG	488-94
AB	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) are associated with distinct phenotypes that include mental retardation. Both PWS and AS are caused by loss of function of genes located in chromosome 15q11-q13, an area subject to genomic imprinting. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (M-PCR), based on parent of origin specific DNA methylation at the promoter region of the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N gene (SNRPN), can provide accurate and rapid diagnosis for nearly all PWS patients while it is less accurate for AS patients. We report the development of a referral system for molecular diagnosis of PWS and AS based on M-PCR. METHODS: Pediatric geneticists, psychiatrists, or neurologists were asked to evaluate phenotypes of patients with PWS or AS and complete a questionnaire designed according to the consensus criteria to diagnose these conditions. Molecular analysis based on M-PCR was performed for patients with a score of at least two. RESULTS: A total of 108 patients with suspected PWS and 20 patients with suspected AS were referred for diagnostic testing. PWS was diagnosed in 26 of these patients and AS in two. Among the major diagnostic criteria for PWS, excessive weight gain, developmental delay, and hyperphagia were more prevalent in older patients (&gt; or = 1 yr) than in younger patients. Cerebral hypotonia and developmental delay were significantly more prevalent in older PWS patients than in non-PWS patients. CONCLUSION: M-PCR is a cost-effective method for the diagnosis of PWS and AS. The limitations of current scoring systems and the low cost of M-PCR suggest that routine molecular screening is justified for patients suspected of having PWS.

TI	Influence of angiotensin-converting enzyme gene insertion/deletion polymorphism on rheumatic valve involvement, valve severity and subsequent valve calcification.
PG	277-81
AB	BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: The relationship between the severity of chronic rheumatic heart disease (RHD) and predisposing factors is unknown, and genetic predictors for severe scarring and calcification of the mitral valve are not well defined. A high angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity has been demonstrated in valve tissue. Thus, a case-control study was conducted to investigate any possible relationship between ACE gene polymorphisms and chronic mitral valve disease severity and calcification. METHODS: This case-control study included 82 patients (24 males, 58 females; mean age 40.3 +/	14.7 years) with chronic rheumatic mitral valve, and 154 control subjects (53 males, 101 females; mean age 43.4 +/	13.4 years). ACE gene insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphisms were identified using polymerase chain reaction methods. RESULTS: Among RHD subjects, 31 (30.6%) were D/D, 25 (32.7%) were I/D, and 26 (18.8%) were I/I. Among controls, 57 (57.4%) were D/D, 69 (61.3%) were I/D, and 28 (35.2%) were I/I. The frequency of ACE I/I genotype was higher in RHD subjects than in controls (chi2 = 7.4, df = 2, p &lt; 0.030; D/D versus I/D versus I/I), or (chi2 = 5.5, df = 1, p &lt; 0.019; DD + ID versus II). Predisposition to RHD was significantly less frequent in the D/D genotype. There was no statistically significant difference in the genetic analysis of RHD with respect to mitral valve score, severity of mitral regurgitation and left atrial diameter. Mitral valve calcification was significantly associated with a higher frequency of I/I genotype and I/D genotype than D/D genotype alone (chi2 = 6.2, df = 2, p = 0.043). The ACE I/I genotype was associated with a predisposition to a greater risk of severe calcific valve disease. CONCLUSION: The ACE I/I genotype is more common in patients with rheumatic valve disease than in the normal population. This suggests that the ACE gene polymorphism may be involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatic heart disease.

TI	Angiotensin-converting enzyme gene insertion/deletion polymorphism in children with Henoch-Schonlein purpua nephritis.
PG	158-61
AB	This study investigated the relationship between angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene insertion/deletion polymorphism and the occurrence, severity, prognosis of HSPN. The polymorphism of ACE gene in 103 HSPN cases and 100 healthy children was studied by using the polymerase chain reactions (PCR). Its relation to the clinical manifestation, pathological classification and prognosis of HSPN was analyzed accordingly. The results showed that: (1) there was a significantly higher frequency for DD genotype in HSPN children (P&lt;0.01); (2) DD genotype was more frequently seen in HSPN children with gross hematuria and massive proteinuria (P&lt;0.05), while DI genotype was more common in HSPN children group with renal insufficiency (P&lt;0.05); (3) although mesangial proliferative lesion was most frequently observed in 21 biopsied HSPN children, and DD genotype frequency was still higher in children with severe pathology (Class III IV); (4) II genotype was significantly frequent in HSPN children with complete remission in the follow-up of 32 HSPN children. It was concluded that the deletion allele of ACE gene might play a role, at least to some extent, in the occurrence, deterioration and progression in juvenile HSPN.

TI	Impact of LIMK1, MMP2 and TNF-alpha variations for intracranial aneurysm in Japanese population.
PG	211-6
AB	Genetic factors are known to have an important role in intracranial aneurysm (IA) pathogenesis. The purpose of this study is to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with IA in Japanese population. A total of 2050 IA patients and 1835 controls recruited in Biobank Japan, The University of Tokyo were used in this study. In all, 45 SNPs in 24 genes encoding proteins, which have been considered to be possible risk factors to IA pathogenesis, were genotyped using multiplex PCR-invader assay. Association analysis was evaluated by logistic regression analysis before and after adjustment of age, smoking and hypertension status. This case-control association study revealed a SNP, rs6460071 located on LIMK1 gene (P = 0.00069) to be significantly associated with increased risk of IA. In addition, two SNPs, rs243847 (P = 0.00086) and rs243865 (P = 0.00090), on matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2) gene and one SNP rs1799724 (P = 0.0026) on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) gene, are marginally associated with IA in male	and female-specific manner, respectively. In conclusion, a large-scale case-control association study was conducted to verify genetic variations associated with IA in Japanese population. This study gave insights on the importance of stratified analysis between genders, and suggested that the underlying mechanism of IA pathogenesis might differ between females and males.

TI	Single nucleotide variants in the beta2-adrenergic and beta3-adrenergic receptor genes explained 18.3% of adolescent obesity variation.
PG	365-9
AB	Associations of obesity with its candidate genes, beta-adrenergic receptor genes (ADRBs), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma), and uncoupling proteins (UCPs) were studied in Korean adolescents. We analyzed the obesity-related phenotypes body mass index (BMI), percentage of body fat, plasma leptin and insulin levels, fasting glucose concentration, and plasma lipid profile in 329 teenagers to investigate the effects of seven single nucleotide variants 252G/A, 523C/A and 1053G/C in ADRB2; Trp64Arg in ADRB3; 161C/T in PPARgamma; Ala55Val in UCP2; and 210C/T in UCP3. The 1053G/C polymorphism (P &lt; 0.05) in the ADRB2 gene and the Trp64Arg polymorphism (P &lt; 0.01) in the ADRB3 gene were associated with BMI after adjustment for dietary energy intake. Trp64Arg polymorphism also influenced percentage of body fat (P &lt; 0.01) and plasma leptin level (P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, significant interaction effects between the 1053G/C and Trp64Arg polymorphisms were observed on BMI (P &lt; 0.01). The polymorphisms of the ADRB2 and ADRB3 genes explained 4.3% and 10.1% of the variation on BMI, and the two loci effect, including their epistasis, explained 18.3%. We concluded that 1053G/C and Trp64Arg polymorphisms of the ADRB genes additively and interactively contributed to the variation of complex adolescent obesity.

TI	The C825T polymorphism in the G-protein beta3 subunit gene and diabetic complications in IDDM patients.
PG	188-91
AB	Complications of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality; however, the mechanisms of their development are still to be elucidated. Genetic susceptibility contributes to the pathogenesis of nephropathy in IDDM. Enhanced G-protein activation, a cellular phenotype observed in cultured cells from patients with essential hypertension, was recently documented in IDDM subjects with nephropathy. A C825T polymorphism was recently described in GNB3, the gene encoding the beta 3 subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins. This genetic variant has been associated with enhanced G-protein activation. The 825T allele was observed more frequently in a group with essential hypertension. We analyzed the role of the C825T polymorphism in the predisposition to diabetic complications in IDDM. In this study, we investigated the frequency of this polymorphism in a large case-control study and found no association of the 825T allele with diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy.

TI	Construction of 700 human/mouse A9 monochromosomal hybrids and analysis of imprinted genes on human chromosome 6.
PG	137-45
AB	As an in vitro assay system for the identification of human imprinted genes, a library of human/mouse A9 monochromosomal hybrids containing a single, intact bsr-tagged human chromosome of known parental origin, derived from normal human fibroblasts, has been previously generated by microcell-mediated chromosome transfer (MMCT). To supplement this assay system, we constructed additional 700 A9 monochromosomal hybrids, using a pSTneo or pPGKneo selection marker. To validate the A9 hybrids, we screened them with chromosome-specific polymorphic markers, and identified the hybrids containing either human chromosome 6, 7, 14, 18, or 21 of known parental origin. Matching paternal and maternal chromosome pairs of A9 hybrids were identified for chromosomes 6, 7, 14, and 18. The paternal-specific expression of ZAC (zinc finger protein, which regulates apoptosis and cell cycle arrest) and HYMAI (hydatidiform mole-associated and imprinted transcript), and the maternal-specific methylation of a CpG island within an imprinted domain on human chromosome 6q24, were maintained in A9 hybrids. For an example, we profiled the expression of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and the methylation of CpG islands in the 300-kb imprinted domain around 6q24, which may be associated with cancers and transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM). Thus, the 700 A9 hybrids should be useful for various aspects of imprinting studies.

TI	Preferential transmission of maternal allele with DQA1*0301-DQB1*0302 haplotype to affected offspring in families with type 1 diabetes.
PG	318-22
AB	To approach the possible involvement of an epigenetic mechanism in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes, we investigate here a parent-of-origin effect in transmission of the susceptible alleles at HLA-DQ loci by the transmission disequilibrium test. When we examined alleles of affected offspring of Japanese origin in 28 nuclear families, the maternal alleles were significantly different from the paternal alleles. Furthermore, the maternal alleles with the susceptible DQA1*0301-DQB1*0302 haplotype showed strong transmission disequilibrium with antiglutamic acid decarboxylase antibody-positive type 1 diabetes, while the paternal alleles with the same haplotype did not. This differential transmission disequilibrium of the susceptible allele was confirmed by the contingency table analysis for transmitted or nontransmitted alleles of both parental origin. The unique transmission of the susceptible allele observed supports the hypothesis that an epigenetic mechanism including genomic imprinting at the HLA-DQ region is involved in the pathogenesis and the genetic complexity of type 1 diabetes.

TI	Ambulatory blood pressure, left ventricular mass and vascular phenotypes in relation to the endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene Glu298Asp and intron 4 polymorphisms in a population-based family study.
PG	413-20
AB	Reduced nitric oxide production is associated with pathological changes in the cardiovascular system. In a study of randomly chosen families, we analysed the relationship between two polymorphisms (Glu298Asp and intron 4) of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and ambulatory blood pressure (ABP), left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and vascular phenotypes. The study population consisted of 127 parents and 167 offspring. All subjects underwent 24 h ABP monitoring using a SpaceLabs 90207 device. 2D and M-mode echocardiograms were obtained. Pulse wave velocity between the common carotid and femoral artery was measured with the Complior device, and the carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) was assessed by ultrasound. For statistical analysis, covariables and correlations between relatives were taken into account. The frequency of genotypes was as follows: for Glu298Asp: 55.1%-Glu/Glu, 40.1%-Glu/Asp and 4.8%-Asp/Asp; for intron 4: 65.0%-4 b/b, 33.3%-4 b/a and 1.7%-4 a/a, being in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P &gt; or = 0.29). There was no relationship between the eNOS gene polymorphisms and ABP or LVMI either in parents or their offspring. Among parents, carriers of the 298Asp allele had higher IMT values as compared with Glu/Glu homozygotes (0.94 vs 0.70 mm; P = 0.007). Among offspring, there was a similar tendency (0.60 vs 0.53 mm; P = 0.10), which was confirmed by transmission disequilibrium tests for quantitative variables (P &gt; or = 0.07). Our findings indicate that the Glu298Asp polymorphism of eNOS identifies patients with larger carotid IMT, also in younger subjects.

TI	Lack of association between ACE gene polymorphism and left ventricular hypertrophy in essential hypertension.
PG	47-9
AB	The possible association between the insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) gene and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was investigated in a group of essential hypertensive patients. Seventy-one essential hypertensive patients (35 men and 36 women), aged 51 +/	1 years, were genotyped by PCR for the I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene. Cardiac morphology and function were assessed by means of M-mode echocardiography. The relative frequencies of the three genotypes, DD, DI, and II, were respectively: 24%, 55%, and 21%. Mean values of left ventricular mass index were 145, 144, and 150 g/m2 for DD, DI, and II genotypes, without significant differences among them (P = 0.82). Likewise, the prevalence of LVH (76%, 64%, and 87%) was not significantly different among the three genotypes (P = 0.23). We conclude that the ACE gene I/D polymorphism is not associated with LVH in essential hypertension. Journal of Human Hypertension (2000) 14, 47-49.

TI	High-salt diet during pregnancy and angiotensin-related cardiac changes.
PG	1290-7
AB	OBJECTIVES: High-salt intake has been demonstrated in link to hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases could be programmed in fetal origins. We determined the influence of high-salt diet during pregnancy on the development of the heart. METHODS: Fetal cardiac structures, cell cycle, renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and epigenetic alternations in the heart following maternal high salt intake during pregnancy were examined. RESULTS: Following exposure to high salt, disorganized myofibrillae and mitochondria cristae loss were found in the fetus, S-phase for cardiac cells was enhanced, plasma angiotensin II decreased, and cardiac angiotensin II increased in the fetus. Angiotensin II-increased S-phase in the fetal cardiac cells was primarily via AT1 receptor mechanisms. AT2 receptor mRNA and protein in the fetal heart were not affected, whereas AT1 receptor protein, AT1a, and AT1b mRNA were increased. DNA methylation was found at the CpG sites that were related to AT1b receptors in the fetal heart. Cardiac AT1 receptor protein in the adult offspring was also higher following exposure to prenatal high salt. CONCLUSION: The results suggest a relationship between high-salt diet in pregnancy and developmental changes of the cardiac cells and renin-angiotensin system.

TI	New evidence for the fetal insulin hypothesis: fetal angiotensinogen M235T polymorphism is associated with birth weight and elevated fetal total glycated hemoglobin at birth.
PG	732-9
AB	BACKGROUND: Low birth weight is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events in later life. Insulin resistance is a key finding in adult patients with cardiovascular diseases. The neonatal phenotype of an individual with insulin resistance might be low birth weight, as insulin influences fetal growth. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has been associated with cardiovascular disease and insulin resistance. We analyzed whether fetal polymorphisms of the angiotensinogen (AGT) and angiotensin-converting enzyme genes influence birth weight and/or fetal total glycated hemoglobin (fTGH), a surrogate parameter of fetal insulin resistance at birth. METHOD: In 1132 white women delivering singletons, neonatal umbilical blood samples and clinical data of the mothers and newborns were obtained. Newborns were genotyped with respect to the AGT M235T and angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion polymorphism. RESULTS: The AGT M235T TT polymorphism is associated with reduced birth weight (TT: 3288 g versus TM + MM: 3435 g, P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, newborns with a high percentage of fTGH (&gt;6.5%) are more likely to have the TT genotype than those with normal fTGH (&lt;or=6.5%, P &lt; 0.05). With higher cutoffs for fTGH, the significance increases to P less than 0.005. No association was seen between these parameters and the fetal angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion phenotype. CONCLUSION: The fetal AGT M235T polymorphism is associated with low birth weight and elevated fetal fTGH at birth. Previous findings show that elevated fetal fTGH correlates with low birth weight and that higher activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is an independent risk factor for the development of diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease. Therefore, our data are supportive of the fetal insulin hypothesis.

TI	Effects of the C825T polymorphism of the GNB3 gene on body adiposity and blood pressure in fertile and menopausal women: a population-based study.
PG	238-43
AB	OBJECTIVES: The 825T allele of the GNB3 gene is implicated in adipose distribution, predisposing to obesity and hypertension. Menopause is also considered a condition leading to excess adiposity and hypertension. The aim of the present study was to clarify whether the effects of menopause on body weight and blood pressure are influenced by the C825T polymorphism of the GNB3 gene. METHODS: The study involved 1339 subjects (43% men) aged 18-95 years, genotyped at the GNB3 825 locus, undergoing, in an epidemiological population-based frame, questionnaire, anthropometrics and blood examinations. RESULTS: Mean skinfold thickness (MST), truncal obesity and excess subcutaneous adiposity (MST greater than median) were higher in women than in men. A significant interaction was detected between menopausal status and the C825T polymorphism (Pint &gt; 0.0001). MST, truncal obesity and excess subcutaneous adiposity were lower in CC fertile than menopausal women, but were comparable in TT fertile and menopausal women. In a multivariate logistic model for excess subcutaneous adiposity, the relative risk of menopause was 4.12 (95% confidence interval 2.35-7.22) in CC women but was insignificant in the other two genotypes. In fertile women only, higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) was detected in TT than in CC genotypes. CONCLUSION: An interaction exists between the C825T polymorphism and menopause in controlling body adiposity and blood pressure in women. Adiposity and SBP are higher in menopausal than in fertile women, provided they have the CC genotype. TT fertile women show the same adiposity as those in menopause. Men have the same excess adiposity as menopausal women, independent of the GNB3 genotype.

TI	Angiotensin-converting enzyme gene polymorphism predicts the time-course of blood pressure response to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in the AASK trial.
PG	2082-92
AB	OBJECTIVE: It has yet to be determined whether genotyping at the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) locus is predictive of blood pressure response to an ACE inhibitor. METHODS: Participants from the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension trial randomized to the ACE inhibitor ramipril (n = 347) were genotyped at three polymorphisms on ACE, just downstream from the ACE insertion/deletion polymorphism (Ins/Del): G12269A, C17888T, and G20037A. Time to reach target mean arterial pressure (&lt;/=107 mmHg) was analyzed by genotype and ACE haplotype using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: Individuals with a homozygous genotype at G12269A responded significantly faster than those with a heterozygous genotype; the adjusted (average number of medications and baseline mean arterial pressure) hazard ratio (homozygous compared to heterozygous genotype) was 1.86 (95% confidence limits 1.32-3.23; P &lt; 0.001 for G12269A genotype). The adjusted hazard ratio for participants with homozygous ACE haplotypes compared to those heterozygous ACE haplotypes was 1.40 (1.13-1.75; P = 0.003 for haplotype). The ACE genotype effects were specific for ACE inhibition (i.e., not seen among those randomized to a calcium channel blocker), and were independent of population stratification. CONCLUSIONS: African-Americans with a homozygous genotype at G12269A or homozygous ACE haplotypes responded to ramipril significantly faster than those with a heterozygous genotype or heterozygous haplotypes, suggesting that heterosis may be an important determinant of responsiveness to an ACE inhibitor. These associations may be a result of biological activity of this polymorphism, or of linkage disequilibrium with nearby variants such as the ACE Ins/Del, perhaps in the regulation of ACE splicing.

TI	Heritability of blood pressure traits and the genetic contribution to blood pressure variance explained by four blood-pressure-related genes.
PG	565-70
AB	OBJECTIVE: To study the heritability of four blood pressure traits and the proportion of variance explained by four blood-pressure-related genes. METHODS: All participants are members of an extended pedigree from a Dutch genetically isolated population. Heritability and genetic correlations of systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure and pulse pressure were assessed using a variance components approach (SOLAR). Polymorphisms of the alpha-adducin (ADD1), angiotensinogen (AGT), angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and G protein beta3 (GNB3) genes were typed. RESULTS: Heritability estimates were significant for all four blood pressure traits, ranging between 0.24 and 0.37. Genetic correlations between systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure were high (0.93-0.98), and those between pulse pressure and diastolic blood pressure were low (0.05). The ADD1 polymorphism explained 0.3% of the variance of pulse pressure (P = 0.07), and the polymorphism of GNB3 explained 0.4% of the variance of systolic blood pressure (P = 0.02), 0.2% of mean arterial pressure (P = 0.05) and 0.3% of pulse pressure (P = 0.06). CONCLUSION: Genetic factors contribute to a substantial proportion of blood pressure variance. In this study, the effect of polymorphisms of ADD1, AGT, AT1R and GNB3 explained a very small proportion of the heritability of blood pressure traits. As new genes associated with blood pressure are localized in the future, their effect on blood pressure variance should be calculated.

TI	Impact of maternal angiotensinogen M235T polymorphism and angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion polymorphism on blood pressure, protein excretion and fetal outcome in pregnancy.
PG	1255-61
AB	OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that genetically determined alterations of the renin-angiotensin system are associated with hypertensive disorders in pregnancy. METHODS: A genetic association study was conducted at the obstetrics department of the Charite university hospital, Berlin, Germany. A total of 1068 Caucasian women were consecutively included after delivery and genotyped for the angiotensinogen M235T polymorphism and the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion polymorphism. RESULTS: Women homozygous for the angiotensinogen T allele have significantly elevated mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures in the third trimester (118.4 +/	1.1/71.5 +/	0.7 versus 116.9 +/	0.3/70.4 +/	0.2 mmHg, n = 128 versus 940; P &lt; 0.05). This finding is especially pronounced in the subgroup of primigravid women. The ACE polymorphism is not associated with blood pressure during pregnancy. None of the polymorphisms is associated with urinary protein excretion or oedema during pregnancy. Maternal polymorphisms do not influence fetal growth and birth weight. There is, however, an interesting trend towards an increased incidence of circulatory system malformations in newborns carrying alleles that are known to be associated with decreased intrinsic renin-angiotensin system activity. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate for the first time in a large Caucasian population that a common maternal polymorphism of the angiotensinogen gene is related to a blood pressure increase during pregnancy. The angiotensinogen M235T polymorphism might contribute to the multifactorial pathogenesis of gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia.

TI	Family-based associations between the angiotensin	converting enzyme insertion/deletion polymorphism and multiple cardiovascular risk factors in Chinese.
PG	487-91
AB	OBJECTIVE: We investigated, in a sample of Chinese families, the associations of body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), serum lipids, fasting plasma glucose, serum creatinine and uric acid with the insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene. METHODS: We genotyped 902 subjects from 186 nuclear families recruited in Shanghai, China, via a specialized hypertension clinic. We performed family-based association analyses for continuous and dichotomous phenotypic measurements using the quantitative and sib	transmission/disequilibrium tests (QTDT and Sib-TDT), respectively. RESULTS: The study sample included 121 parents and 781 offspring from 25 two-parent families, 71 one-parent families, and 90 families without parental information. The median number of offspring was four (range from 2 to 10). Of the 654 (85.4%) hypertensive offspring, 458 took antihypertensive drugs. The 354 male offspring were slightly younger than the 427 female siblings (48.1 versus 49.2 years, P = 0.03), but they had similar BMI (25.1 kg/m). In 482 informative offspring, QTDT analyses demonstrated a significant association between BMI and the transmission of the ACE D allele (regression coefficient 0.563, chi 2 = 4.02, P = 0.04). In 106 families with at least one hypertensive offspring and at least one normotensive sibling, Sib-TDT analyses showed that the ACE D allele was slightly over-transmitted from heterozygous parents to hypertensive offspring (P = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: Our family-based study suggests that in Chinese, the ACE I/D polymorphism might play a role in the development of obesity and hypertension, which are closely linked cardiovascular risk factors.

TI	Association of peripheral and central arterial wave reflections with the CYP11B2 -344C allele and sodium excretion.
PG	2311-9
AB	OBJECTIVE: Angiotensin II and aldosterone, generated by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2), respectively, not only regulate sodium and water homeostasis, but also influence vascular remodeling in response to high blood pressure. In the European Project on Genes in Hypertension (EPOGH), we therefore investigated whether the ACE I/D and CYP11B2 C-344T polymorphisms influence early arterial wave reflections, a measure of vascular stiffness. METHODS: We measured the peripheral and central augmentation index of systolic blood pressure by applanation tonometry at the level of the radial artery in 622 subjects (160 families and 64 unrelated individuals) randomly recruited from three European populations, whose average urinary sodium excretion ranged from 196 to 245 mmol/day. In multivariate analyses, with sodium excretion analyzed as a continuous variable, we explored the phenotype-genotype associations by means of generalized estimating equations and the quantitative transmission disequilibrium test. RESULTS: The peripheral and central augmentation indexes were significantly higher in CYP11B2 -344C allele carriers than in -344T homozygotes. In offspring, early wave reflections increased with the transmission of the -344C allele. This effect of the CYP11B2 polymorphism occurred in subjects with a higher than median urinary sodium excretion (210 mmol/day). The ACE I/D polymorphism did not influence augmentation of systolic blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: The CYP11B2 C-344T polymorphism affects arterial stiffness. However, sodium intake seems to modulate this genetic effect.

TI	Lack of association of the angiotensinogen-6 polymorphism with blood pressure levels in the comprehensive NHLBI Family Blood Pressure Program. National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.
PG	867-76
AB	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between the angiotensinogen-6 polymorphism (AGT-6) and blood pressure levels. DESIGN: Data were analysed from the first 4,322 subjects of the NHLBI Family Blood Pressure Program (FBPP), consisting of four networks (GenNet, GENOA, HyperGEN and SAPPHIRe), each conducting a multicentre observational family study to identify and characterize the genetic determinants of hypertension and blood pressure. The four studies use different designs (concordant sibpairs, discordant pairs, sibships, extended pedigrees), target different ethnic groups (Caucasian, African-American, Japanese, Chinese), and have different inclusion/exclusion criteria. However, the protocols and definitions were standardized across networks before data collection to allow maximum poolability. METHODS: Each network/racial group was analysed separately, using generalized linear models that accounted for the non-independence of family members and/or the confounding of anti-hypertensive medications as needed. The results were also pooled using a pre-planned meta-analysis technique. RESULTS: AGT-6 was not significantly associated with blood pressure in any network/racial group. In the meta-analysis, the pooled effect of AGT-6 was small [hazard ratio = 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.99-1.22, P= 0.0647 for systolic; hazard ratio = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.89-1.21, P= 0.6383 for diastolic]. A post-hoc analysis restricting to subjects meeting JNC VI criteria for Stage I hypertension (blood pressure &gt; 140/90 mmHg or medicated) showed a stronger statistically significant relationship for systolic blood pressure (hazard ratio = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.04-2.00, P= 0.0283). CONCLUSIONS: AGT-6 has minimal to no effect on the inter-individual variation of blood pressure levels, and is at best a 'minor gene' for blood pressure in the population as a whole.

TI	Polymorphism of the angiotensin I converting enzyme gene is apparently not related to high blood pressure: Dutch Hypertension and Offspring Study.
PG	345-8
AB	OBJECTIVE: Studies in genetically hypertensive rats and their normotensive Wistar-Kyoto control rats have revealed a linkage of a chromosomal region containing the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene with blood pressure. This led to the hypothesis that ACE is a possible candidate gene for primary hypertension in humans. We defined the genotypes and allele frequencies of an insertion-deletion (I/D) polymorphism in parental couples who both had either high or low blood pressure and in their offspring. SUBJECTS: Parents (n = 111) and offspring (n = 75) with defined blood pressure status from the Dutch Hypertension and Offspring Study. METHODS: Genomic DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers flanking the polymorphic region in intron 16 of the ACE gene. Alleles were detected on agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. RESULTS: Allele frequencies for the D-allele were similar in parents with high (0.66) and low blood pressure (0.59) and in their offspring (0.67 and 0.69, respectively). A similar lack of difference was found with respect to the complementary I-allele. CONCLUSIONS: In the present rather large sample we failed to find a significant association between I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene and blood pressure status in subjects with high or low blood pressure and in their offspring.

PG	3918-26
AB	Regulatory T cells (Tregs) constitute an attractive therapeutic target given their essential role in controlling autoimmunity. However, recent animal studies provide evidence for functional heterogeneity and lineage plasticity within the Treg compartment. To understand better the plasticity of human Tregs in the context of type 1 diabetes, we characterized an IFN-gamma-competent subset of human CD4(+)CD127(lo/-)CD25(+) Tregs. We measured the frequency of Tregs in the peripheral blood of patients with type 1 diabetes by epigenetic analysis of the Treg-specific demethylated region (TSDR) and the frequency of the IFN-gamma(+) subset by flow cytometry. Purified IFN-gamma(+) Tregs were assessed for suppressive function, degree of TSDR demethylation, and expression of Treg lineage markers FOXP3 and Helios. The frequency of Tregs in peripheral blood was comparable but the FOXP3(+)IFN-gamma(+) fraction was significantly increased in patients with type 1 diabetes compared to healthy controls. Purified IFN-gamma(+) Tregs expressed FOXP3 and possessed suppressive activity but lacked Helios expression and were predominately methylated at the TSDR, characteristics of an adaptive Treg. Naive Tregs were capable of upregulating expression of Th1-associated T-bet, CXCR3, and IFN-gamma in response to IL-12. Notably, naive, thymic-derived natural Tregs also demonstrated the capacity for Th1 differentiation without concomitant loss of Helios expression or TSDR demethylation.

TI	Does the polymorphism 677C-T of the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene contribute to homocysteine-related vascular disease?
PG	812-22
AB	Whether the 677C-T polymorphism of the methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene acts as a risk factor for homocysteine-related vascular disease remains a matter of debate. Testing for the 677C-T nucleotide substitution and assay of plasma homocysteine were carried out simultaneously in 69 controls and 113 vascular disease patients from the Paris area. The variant gene frequency as well as the variant homozygous genotype frequency were very similar in controls and patients. Conversely, plasma homocysteine levels were substantially higher in patients than in controls. A slight interaction between the 677C-T MTHFR polymorphism and homocysteinaemia was observed in the patient group only, while a negative correlation between fasting homocysteine and plasma folate levels was found in all individuals homozygous for the 677C-T MTHFR genotype, irrespective of vascular disease. These data suggest that the 677C-T MTHFR polymorphism is not a major determinant of the vascular disease but contributes to increased plasma homocysteine concentration in conjunction with low plasma folate levels.

TI	Molecular genetics of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency.
PG	589-94
AB	In severe MTHFR deficiency with neonatal or adolescent onset, 9 rare mutations have been identified. In mild MTHFR deficiency with thermolabile enzyme, a single common mutation (an alanine-to-valine substitution) is involved, but a genetic-nutrient interactive effect is required to produce mild hyperhomocysteinaemia. This interactive effect has been proposed to be a risk factor for arteriosclerosis and for neural-tube defects. Large-scale studies are required for confirmation of the role of MTHFR in these multifactorial processes as well as to assess its role in other folate-dependent disorders.

TI	Recognition of emotion in facial expression by people with Prader-Willi syndrome.
PG	75-84
LID	10.1111/j.1365-2788.2010.01348.x [doi]
AB	BACKGROUND: People with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) may have mild intellectual impairments but less is known about their social cognition. Most parents/carers report that people with PWS do not have normal peer relationships, although some have older or younger friends. Two specific aspects of social cognition are being able to recognise other people's emotion and to then respond appropriately. In a previous study, mothers/carers thought that 26% of children and 23% of adults with PWS would not respond to others' feelings. They also thought that 64% could recognise happiness, sadness, anger and fear and a further 30% could recognise happiness and sadness. However, reports of emotion recognition and response to emotion were partially dissociated. It was therefore decided to test facial emotion recognition directly. METHOD: The participants were 58 people of all ages with PWS. They were shown a total of 20 faces, each depicting one of the six basic emotions and asked to say what they thought that person was feeling. The faces were shown one at a time in random order and each was accompanied by a reminder of the six basic emotions. RESULTS: This cohort of people with PWS correctly identified 55% of the different facial emotions. These included 90% of happy faces, 55% each of sad and surprised faces, 43% of disgusted faces, 40% of angry faces and 37% of fearful faces. Genetic subtype differences were found only in the predictors of recognition scores, not in the scores themselves. Selective impairment was found in fear recognition for those with PWS who had had a depressive illness and in anger recognition for those with PWS who had had a psychotic illness. CONCLUSIONS: The inability to read facial expressions of emotion is a deficit in social cognition apparent in people with PWS. This may be a contributing factor in their difficulties with peer relationships.

TI	Relationship between the IQ of people with Prader-Willi syndrome and that of their siblings: evidence for imprinted gene effects.
PG	411-8
AB	BACKGROUND: Genetic disorders occasionally provide the means to uncover potential mechanisms linking gene expression and physical or cognitive characteristics or behaviour. Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is one such genetic disorder in which differences between the two main genetic subtypes have been documented (e.g. higher verbal IQ in one vs. higher performance IQ in the other; slower than normal reaction time in one vs. normal in the other). In a population study of PWS, the IQ distribution of people with PWS was approximately normal. This raises the question of whether this distribution arose from a systematic effect of PWS on IQ (hypothesis 1) or whether it was the fortuitous result of random effects (hypothesis 2). METHOD: The correlation between PWS and sibling IQ was determined in order to discriminate between the two hypotheses. In the first case we would expect the correlation to be similar to that found in the general population (0.5); in the second case it would be zero. RESULTS: It was found that the overall PWS-sibling IQ correlation was 0.3 but that the two main genetic subtypes of PWS differed in their familial IQ relationships. As expected, the IQs of normal siblings correlated 0.5, and this was also the case with one genetic subtype of PWS (uniparental disomy) and their siblings, while the other subtype IQ correlated -0.07 with sibling IQ. CONCLUSIONS: This is a potentially powerful result that gives another clue to the role of genes on chromosome 15 in the determination of IQ. It is another systematic difference between the genetic subtypes of PWS, which needs an explanation in terms of the very small genetic differences between them.

TI	A specific pathway can be identified between genetic characteristics and behaviour profiles in Prader-Willi syndrome via cognitive, environmental and physiological mechanisms.
PG	493-500
AB	BACKGROUND: Behavioural phenotypes associated with genetic syndromes have been extensively investigated in order to generate rich descriptions of phenomenology, determine the degree of specificity of behaviours for a particular syndrome, and examine potential interactions between genetic predispositions for behaviour and environmental influences. However, relationships between different aspects of behavioural phenotypes have been less frequently researched and although recent interest in potential cognitive phenotypes or endophenotypes has increased, these are frequently studied independently of the behavioural phenotypes. METHOD: Taking Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) as an example, we discuss evidence suggesting specific relationships between apparently distinct aspects of the PWS behavioural phenotype and relate these to specific endophenotypic characteristics. RESULTS: The framework we describe progresses through biological, cognitive, physiological and behavioural levels to develop a pathway from genetic characteristics to behaviour with scope for interaction with the environment at any stage. CONCLUSIONS: We propose this multilevel approach as useful in setting out hypotheses in order to structure research that can more rapidly advance theory.

TI	Academic underachievement by people with Prader-Willi syndrome.
PG	188-200
AB	BACKGROUND: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetically determined neurodevelopmental disorder that is associated with the under-expression of maternally imprinted genes at the 15q11-q13 chromosomal locus. In addition to a characteristic physical and behavioural phenotype, those with the syndrome have impaired social cognition, literal mindedness and inflexibility. The present authors investigated the relationship between the PWS cognitive and behavioural phenotype, educational experience, and levels of attainment in reading, writing and arithmetic. METHODS: All subjects from a population-based sample of people with PWS, augmented by those with PWS living in other regions together with a contrast group of people with learning disability (LD) of other aetiologies, are included in the present study. Those children over 3 years of age whose families consented or adults who themselves consented were assessed for ability and attainment (over 7 years of age), and information on functional ability was also obtained from an informant. Underachievement was defined as the difference between the score predicted from full-scale IQ and the actual achievement score. RESULTS: Commonly, levels of achievement were lower than would have been predicted on the basis of IQ among those in the groups with PWS and LD. In the group with PWS, underachievement across academic domains was positively correlated with the percentage of time in education in a special school and negatively correlated with Vineland Socialization domain standard score. There were no across-domain significant correlations in the group with LD. When using multiple regression analysis, the percentage of time in special school was the only predictor of underachievement and only in the group with PWS. However, some children with PWS in special schools did achieve as expected in at least one academic domain. CONCLUSIONS: Children with PWS may be placed in special schools largely because of their behavioural problems or physical disabilities, or expectations based on their PWS status. Their intellectual abilities may well be masked by their immature social behaviour. The present authors propose that a failure to recognize and address the specific educational needs which follow from this combination of poor socialization skills and complex maladaptive behaviours, in the context of relatively mild LD, may explain their findings.

TI	Cognitive abilities and genotype in a population-based sample of people with Prader-Willi syndrome.
PG	172-87
AB	BACKGROUND: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is characterized by extreme floppiness at birth, impaired sexual development, short stature, severe over-eating, characteristic physical features and learning disabilities (LD). Impaired social cognition, literal mindedness and cognitive inflexibility are also present. The syndrome has two main genetic subtypes that both result in the failure of expression of maternally imprinted genes on chromosome 15 at the locus q11-13. METHODS: Through multiple sources, we attempted to identify all people with PWS living in one health region in the UK. Additional people with PWS identified in other regions were also recruited to augment the study sample. A comparison group of people with LD as a result of aetiologies other than PWS was also identified. All people from these three groups, over age three, who gave their consent, were assessed using tests of ability and attainment. In addition, their main carers were interviewed using a semistructured interview. Blood samples for genetic diagnosis were obtained from all consenting participants. FINDINGS: The IQ distribution of the population sample was approximately normal with a mean IQ 40 points below that of the general population. There were systematic differences between the two main genetic subtypes. Those with disomies differed in cognitive profiles from both those with deletions and the comparison LD group (the latter two groups were very similar) in terms of better verbal abilities and impaired coding ability. Some people with PWS deletions had strong visuospatial skills. INTERPRETATION: We propose that the normal distribution of IQ, shifted downwards relative to that of the general population, is the result of a global effect on IQ of the PWS gene(s), and that the different cognitive profile seen in those with chromosome 15 maternal disomies is a specific effect of a gene, or genes, on chromosome 15 which is differentially either expressed or not expressed in those with disomies relative to those with deletions. One hypothesis is that these subtle cognitive differences are a manifestation of the genetic influences of gender-specific imprinted genes on cerebral lateralization. This requires further investigation.

Adiponectin circulates in three different isoforms: high molecular weight (HMW), medium molecular weight (MMW) and low molecular weight (LMW) isoforms. The genetics of adiponectin isoforms is mostly unknown. Our aim was to investigate whether and to which extent circulating adiponectin isoforms are heritable and whether they share common genetic backgrounds with insulin resistance-related traits. METHODS: In a family-based sample of 640 nondiabetic White Caucasians from Italy, serum adiponectin isoforms concentrations were measured by ELISA. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ADIPOQ gene previously reported to affect total adiponectin levels (rs17300539, rs1501299 and rs677395) were genotyped. The heritability of adiponectin isoform levels was assessed by variance component analysis. A linear mixed effects model was used to test the association between SNPs and adiponectin isoforms. Bivariate analyses were conducted to study genetic correlations between adiponectin isoforms levels and other insulin resistance-related traits. RESULTS: All isoforms were highly heritable (h(2) = 0.60-0.80, P = 1.0 x 10(-13)-1.0 x 10(-23)). SNPs rs17300539, rs1501299 and rs6773957 explained a significant proportion of HMW variance (2-9%, P = 1.0 x 10(-3)-1.0 x 10(-5)). In a multiple-SNP model, only rs17300539 and rs1501299 remained associated with HMW adiponectin (P = 3.0 x 10(-4) and 2.0 x 10(-2)). Significant genetic correlations (P = 1.0 x 10(-2)-1.0 x 10(-5)) were observed between HMW adiponectin and fasting insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, HDL cholesterol and the metabolic syndrome score. Only rs1501299 partly accounted for these genetic correlations. CONCLUSION: Circulating levels of adiponectin isoforms are highly heritable. The genetic control of HMW adiponectin is shared in part with insulin resistance-related traits and involves, but is not limited to, the ADIPOQ locus.

TI	Apolipoprotein C-III gene polymorphism and several environmental factors with serum lipid levels in the Guangxi Hei Yi Zhuang and Han populations.
PG	777-85
AB	BACKGROUND: Apolipoprotein (apo) C-III gene polymorphisms have been associated with increased plasma triglycerides (TGs) and coronary artery disease, but the results have not always been concordant among diverse populations. The present study was undertaken to detect the association of the apoC-III 3238C&gt;G polymorphism and several environmental factors with serum lipid profiles in the Guangxi Hei Yi Zhuang and Han populations. METHODS: A total of 490 subjects of Hei Yi Zhuang and 540 participants of Han Chinese aged 15 to 89 years were randomly selected from our previous stratified randomized cluster samples. Genotyping of the apoC-III 3238C&gt;G was performed by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism combined with gel electrophoresis and then confirmed by direct sequencing. RESULTS: There was no difference in the genotype and allele frequencies between the 2 ethnic groups (P &gt; 0.05), but G allele and GG genotype frequencies were higher in females than in males, or in high TG than in normal TG individuals in Hei Yi Zhuang (P &lt; 0.01); and in high total cholesterol than in normal total cholesterol subgroups, in high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) than in normal LDL-C subgroups, or in high apoB than in normal apoB subgroups in Han (P &lt; 0.05). There were also differences in the genotypic frequencies between normal apoA-I and low apoA-I subjects in Hei Yi Zhuang, and between males and females or between normal TG and high TG subgroups in Han (P &lt; 0.05). Serum TG and apoA-I levels were correlated with genotype or allele in Hei Yi Zhuang, and TG, LDL-C, and apoB levels were associated with genotype in Han (P &lt; 0.05). Serum lipid parameters were also correlated with age, sex, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, blood pressure, body weight, and body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences in genotypic and allelic frequencies between the Hei Yi Zhuang and Han populations. But the 3238G carriers have unfavorable serum lipid profiles. The differences in the serum lipid profiles between the 2 ethnic groups might result from different gene-environmental interactions.

TI	Association of TaqIB polymorphism in the cholesteryl ester transfer protein gene with serum lipid levels in the Guangxi Hei Yi Zhuang and Han populations.
PG	847-57
AB	BACKGROUND: Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) plays an important role in lipoprotein metabolism. The present study was undertaken to compare the difference in the CETP TaqIB gene polymorphism and its association with serum lipid levels between the Guangxi Hei Yi Zhuang and Han populations. METHODS: A total of 758 subjects of Hei Yi Zhuang and 778 participants of Han Chinese were surveyed. Genotyping of the CETP TaqIB was performed using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism and then confirmed using direct sequencing. RESULTS: The genotypic and allelic frequencies were significant differences between smokers and nonsmokers, or between hypertensives and normotensives in Hei Yi Zhuang, and between drinkers and nondrinkers in Han. The levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoprotein AI in Hei Yi Zhuang but not in Han were higher in B2B2 genotype than in B1B1 genotype (P &lt; 0.01 for each). Higher HDL-C levels in Hei Yi Zhuang were found only in females, nondrinkers, nonsmokers, subjects with a body mass index of 24 kg/m or lesser, or normotensives in B2B2 genotype. Higher HDL-C levels in Han were found only in females in B2B2 genotype and in subjects with a body mass index of 24 kg/m or lesser or normotensives in B1B2 genotype. The levels of HDL-C in B1B1 and B1B2 individuals in both ethnic groups were higher in drinkers than in nondrinkers. CONCLUSIONS: There were significant differences in the interactions between the CETP TaqIB genotypes and several environmental factors in the Hei Yi Zhuang and Han populations. The polymorphism predicted differences in HDL-C and ApoAI in the Hei Yi Zhuang but not in the Han Chinese, even after adjustment for confounding variables. This means that the gene may not be truly involved in regulation of high-density lipoprotein metabolism or that there is an ethnic-specific effect.

TI	Sulfonylurea therapy in two Korean patients with insulin-treated neonatal diabetes due to heterozygous mutations of the KCNJ11 gene encoding Kir6.2.
PG	616-20
AB	Permanent neonatal diabetes (PND) is a rare form of diabetes characterized by insulin-requiring hyperglycemia diagnosed within the first three months of life. In most cases, the causes are not known. Recently, mutations in the KCNJ11 gene encoding the Kir6.2 subunit of the ATP-sensitive K+ channel have been described in patients with PND. We report the first two Korean cases with PND due to a lysineto	arginine substitution at position 170 (K179R) and a valine-to-methionine substitution at position 59 (V59M) mutations of KCNJ11 encoding Kir6.2, respectively. After several years of insulin therapy, these patients were managed by oral glibenclamide therapy at a daily dose of 0.8-0.9 mg/kg. Their basal c-peptide levels increased after one week of glibenclamide therapy, and one month later, the insulin and c-peptide levels were in the normal ranges without any episodes of hyper	or hypoglycemia. These cases demonstrate that oral sulfonylurea may be the treatment of choice in PND patients with KCNJ11 mutations even at a young age.

TI	Association of TNFA promoter region haplotype in Behcet's Disease.
PG	596-601
AB	Although the etiology of Behcet's Disease (BD; MIM 109650) remains to be clearly elucidated, levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) have been reported to be significantly elevated in BD patients, and TNF-alpha blockers have been demonstrated to exhibit some degree of therapeutic efficacy for a certain subset of BD sufferers. In this study, we have conducted an analysis of the TNFA haplotypes in the promoter response element that affect the binding affinity of specific transcription factors, in order to characterize their association with the clinical features of BD. Six polymorphisms in the promoter region of TNFA were genotyped in 254 BD patients and 344 control subjects, via the PCR-RFLP technique. TNFA -1031*C, -863*A and -308*G alleles were associated with an increased risk of BD (p=0.030, OR=1.4; p=0.008, OR=1.5; p=0.010, OR=1.8, respectively). The sole TNFA haplotype -1031C-863A-857C-376G-308G-238G, was associated with a 1.6 fold increase in the risk of BD, whereas the TNFA haplotype -1031T-863C-857C-376G-308A-238G was associated with a 0.6 decreased risk of BD. The TNFA -1031*C, -863*A, -857*C and -308*G alleles were significantly associated with BD. The findings of this study, collectively, indicate that TNFA haplotypes in the promoter response elements may exert significant influence on susceptibility to BD.

TI	Genetic and nongenetic sources of variation in phospholipid transfer protein activity.
PG	983-90
AB	Phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) belongs to the lipid transfer/lipopolysaccharide-binding protein gene family. Expression of PLTP has been implicated in the development of atherosclerosis. We evaluated the effects of PLTP region tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the prediction of both carotid artery disease (CAAD) and PLTP activity. CAAD effects were evaluated in 442 Caucasian male subjects with severe CAAD and 497 vascular disease-free controls. SNP prediction of PLTP transfer activity was evaluated in both a subsample of 87 subjects enriched for an allele of interest and in a confirmation sample of 210 Caucasian males and females. Hemoglobin A1c or insulin level predicted 11-14% of age	and sex-adjusted PLTP activity. PLTP SNPs that predicted approximately 11-30% of adjusted PLTP activity variance were identified in the two cohorts. For rs6065904, the allele that was associated with CAAD was also associated with elevated PLTP activity in both cohorts. SNPs associated with PLTP activity also predicted variation in LDL-cholesterol and LDL-B level only in the replication cohort. These results demonstrate that PLTP activity is strongly influenced by PLTP region polymorphisms and metabolic factors.

TI	Common genetic variation in multiple metabolic pathways influences susceptibility to low HDL-cholesterol and coronary heart disease.
PG	3524-32
AB	A low level of HDL-C is the most common plasma lipid abnormality observed in men with established coronary heart disease (CHD). To identify allelic variants associated with susceptibility to low HDL-C and CHD, we examined 60 candidate genes with key roles in HDL metabolism, insulin resistance, and inflammation using samples from the Veterans Affairs HDL Intervention Trial (VA-HIT; cases, n = 699) and the Framingham Offspring Study (FOS; controls, n = 705). VA-HIT was designed to examine the benefits of HDL-raising with gemfibrozil in men with low HDL-C (&lt;/=40 mg/dl) and established CHD. After adjustment for multiple testing within each gene, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) significantly associated with case status were identified in the genes encoding LIPC (rs4775065, P &lt; 0.0001); CETP (rs5882, P = 0.0002); RXRA (rs11185660, P = 0.0021); ABCA1 (rs2249891, P = 0.0126); ABCC6 (rs150468, P = 0.0206; rs212077, P = 0.0443); CUBN (rs7893395, P = 0.0246); APOA2 (rs3813627, P = 0.0324); SELP (rs732314, P = 0.0376); and APOC4 (rs10413089, P = 0.0425). Included among the novel findings of this study are the identification of susceptibility alleles for low HDL-C/CHD risk in the genes encoding CUBN and RXRA, and the observation that genetic variation in SELP may influence CHD risk through its effects on HDL.

TI	Relations of APOE promoter polymorphisms to LDL cholesterol and markers of subclinical atherosclerosis in young adults.
PG	1298-306
AB	The common apolipoprotein E (apoE) gene (APOE) epsilon2/epsilon3/epsilon4 polymorphism explains part of serum lipid variation, and polymorphisms in the APOE promoter region have been proposed to participate in the regulation of serum lipid levels within the most common APOE epsilon3/epsilon3 genotype group. We determined APOE -219G/T and +113G/C promoter genotypes and estimated APOE haplotypes in 525 participants of the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study. We studied the associations of the APOE promoter polymorphisms and their haplotypes with cross-sectional and longitudinal serum lipid and apolipoprotein concentrations as well as with flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), carotid artery compliance (CAC), and intima-media thickness (IMT) within the APOE epsilon3/epsilon3 carriers. We found no significant association between the APOE promoter genotypes and serum lipids [low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), HDL-C, and triglycerides], apolipoproteins (apoA-I and apoB), or brachial artery FMD, CAC, or carotid IMT in either men or women. In longitudinal analyses in males, the carriers of heterozygous genotypes (-219G/T or +113G/C) and, furthermore, carriers of the -219T/+113C/epsilon3 haplotype had significantly higher LDL-C and total cholesterol concentrations throughout the 21 year follow-up period compared with homozygous G allele carriers or noncarriers of the -219T/+113C/epsilon3 haplotype. Such associations were not found in females. In summary, the APOE promoter polymorphisms -219G/T and +113G/C as well as their haplotype are associated with longitudinal changes in LDL-C and total cholesterol concentrations in young Finnish males but do not seem to be major determinants for FMD, CAC, or carotid IMT in males or females.

TI	Association of the A-204C polymorphism in the cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase gene with variations in plasma low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in the Framingham Offspring Study.
PG	1883-9
AB	The first reaction of the catabolic pathway of cholesterol is catalyzed by CYP7 and serves as the rate-limiting step and major site of regulation of bile acid synthesis in the liver. A common A to C substitution at position -204 of the promoter of CYP7 gene has been associated with variations in plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations but the effect of this polymorphism is unknown in the general population. The aim of the present study was therefore to investigate the association of this polymorphism to lipoprotein levels in a population-based sample of 1139 male and 1191 female Framingham Offspring participants. In men, the C variant was associated with higher plasma concentrations of LDL-cholesterol and this association remained significant after adjustment for familial relationship, age, BMI, smoking, alcohol intake, the use of beta-blockers, and apoE genotype. The C variant was also associated with an increased TC/HDL ratio in men. Variance components analysis indicated that allelic variability at nucleotide -204 of the CYP7 gene and polymorphism of the apoE gene accounted for 1 and 5% of the variation of plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations, respectively. In women, however, there was no relationship between LDL-cholesterol and the A-204C polymorphism but subjects homozygous for the CC genotype had significantly lower triglyceride levels than heterozygotes. Moreover, no significant relationship was found between the A-204C variants and lipoprotein particle diameter or the prevalence of coronary heart disease in both genders. Thus, our results show that the A-204C polymorphism in the CYP7 gene is associated with statistically significant variations in LDL-C and triglyceride concentrations in men and women, respectively, but the cumulative effects of these variations on atherosclerotic risk remain uncertain.

TI	Evidence for a third genetic locus causing familial hypercholesterolemia. A non-LDLR, non-APOB kindred.
PG	1113-22
AB	Monogenically inherited hypercholesterolemia is most commonly caused by mutations at the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) locus causing familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or at the apolipoprotein B (APOB) locus causing the disorder familial defective apoB (FDB). Probands from 47 kindreds with a strict clinical diagnosis of FH were selected from the Cardiovascular Genetics Research Lipid Clinic, Utah, for molecular genetic analysis. Using a combination of single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and direct sequencing, 12 different LDLR gene mutations were found in 16 of the probands. Three of the probands were carriers of the APOB R3500Q mutation. In five of the remaining 28 pedigrees where no mutation had been detected, samples from enough relatives were available to examine co-segregation with the LDLR region using the microsatellite marker D19S221, which is within 1 Mb centromeric of the LDLR locus, and D19S394, sited within 150 kb telomeric of the LDLR locus. In four of the families there was strong evidence for co-segregation between the LDLR locus and the phenotype of hypercholesterolemia, but in one large family with 18 living affected members and clear-cut bimodal hypercholesterolemia, there were numerous exclusions of co-segregation. Using length polymorphic markers within and outside the APOB gene, linkage of phenotype in this family to the APOB region was similarly excluded. In this large family, the degree of hypercholesterolemia, prevalence of tendon xanthomata, and occurrence of early coronary disease were indistinguishable from the other families studied. In summary, the data provide unequivocal evidence that a third locus can be etiological for monogenic familial hypercholesterolemia and should be reinvigorating to research in this field.

TI	Interaction of the lipoprotein lipase asparagine 291--&gt;serine mutation with body mass index determines elevated plasma triacylglycerol concentrations: a study in hyperlipidemic subjects, myocardial infarction survivors, and healthy adults.
PG	2104-12
AB	A mutation in the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene, resulting in the substitution of asparagine by serine at residue 291 (LPL-S291), was found to occur in young survivors of a myocardial infarction from Sweden, combined hyperlipidemic subjects from the United Kingdom, and type III hyperlipidemic subjects from Germany at allelic carrier frequencies no different from those found in companion healthy control subjects (3.63 vs. 3.37; 1.85 vs. 1.60; and 2.00 vs. 1.56%, respectively). In a group of 620 healthy middle-aged men from the United Kingdom with baseline and three subsequent annual lipid measurements, mean plasma triacylglycerol (TG), (but not plasma cholesterol) concentrations in carriers of the mutation were significantly elevated over non-carriers (1.95 vs. 1.61 mmol/l, P = 0.05, and 5.83 vs. 5.65 mmol/l, P = 0.29, respectively). When these healthy control subjects were divided according to tertiles of body mass index (BMI), as expected, non-carriers whose BMI was in the upper two tertiles (BMI &gt; or = 25.0 kg/m2) had higher plasma TG concentrations than those in the lowest tertile (1.90 vs. 1.54 mmol/l), but this difference was much greater in LPL-S291 carriers (2.33 vs. 1.36 mmol/l, P = 0.01, BMI x genotype interaction, P = 0.02). To confirm this effect, a second group of 319 healthy subjects from the United Kingdom was screened for LPL-S291. The allelic frequency of the mutation was found to be 1.88% and the effect on plasma lipid concentrations was very similar to that observed in the first control group (plasma TG, 2.31 vs. 1.27 mmol/l, P &lt; 0.001 for LPL-S291 carriers vs. non-carriers, respectively). As before, those carriers whose BMI was in the top two tertiles for this sample (BMI &gt; or = 23.3 kg/m2) had higher plasma TG concentrations than non-carriers (2.31 vs. 1.42 mmol/l). Thus, the LPL-S291 variant may predispose individuals to elevated plasma TG concentrations under conditions such as increased BMI.

TI	Genetic variant in the promoter of connective tissue growth factor gene confers susceptibility to nephropathy in type 1 diabetes.
PG	391-7
AB	BACKGROUND The evidence for genetic susceptibility in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy is well recognised, but the genes involved remain to be identified. It is hypothesised that mutations within the gene encoding connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) will increase the propensity of diabetic subjects to develop nephropathy. METHODS AND RESULTS Genomic screening was performed for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the CTGF gene in 862 subjects from the DCCT/EDIC cohort of type 1 diabetes. A novel SNP was identified in the promoter region that changes a C-G at the position -20. The frequency of GG genotype in microalbuminuric patients (albumin excretion rate (AER) &gt;40 mg/24 h) is significantly greater than diabetics with AER &lt;40 mg/24 h, p&lt;0.0001. The relative risk (RR) to develop microalbuminuria in diabetic subjects with the polymorphism is 3X higher than diabetic subjects without the polymorphism (RR 3.142, 95% CI 1.9238 to 5.1249; p&lt;0.05). Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated that the GG genotype group developed microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria at a more rapid rate than the GC or CC genotypes. Functional studies demonstrated that the basal activity of the substituted allele/promoter (-20 GG allele) was significantly greater than that of the wild type promoter (-20 CC genotype). This higher level of basal activity of substituted allele CTGF/CCN2 promoter was abrogated upon suppression of Smad1 levels, indicating that SNP region in the CTGF/CCN2 promoter plays a vital role in the gene expression. CONCLUSIONS These findings provide the first evidence that variants within the promoter region of the CTGF/CCN2 gene predisposes diabetic subjects to develop albuminuria and demonstrate that Smad1 [corrected] controls the expression of CTGF/CCN2 promoter through this region.

TI	Chromosome 15q11-13 duplication syndrome brain reveals epigenetic alterations in gene expression not predicted from copy number.
PG	86-93
AB	BACKGROUND: Chromosome 15q11-13 contains a cluster of imprinted genes essential for normal mammalian neurodevelopment. Deficiencies in paternal or maternal 15q11-13 alleles result in Prader-Willi or Angelman syndromes, respectively, and maternal duplications lead to a distinct condition that often includes autism. Overexpression of maternally expressed imprinted genes is predicted to cause 15q11-13-associated autism, but a link between gene dosage and expression has not been experimentally determined in brain. METHODS: Postmortem brain tissue was obtained from a male with 15q11-13 hexasomy and a female with 15q11-13 tetrasomy. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to measure 10 15q11-13 transcripts in maternal 15q11-13 duplication, Prader-Willi syndrome, and control brain samples. Southern blot, bisulfite sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridisation were used to investigate epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation. RESULTS: Gene expression and DNA methylation correlated with parental gene dosage in the male 15q11-13 duplication sample with severe cognitive impairment and seizures. Strikingly, the female with autism and milder Prader-Willi-like characteristics demonstrated unexpected deficiencies in the paternally expressed transcripts SNRPN, NDN, HBII85, and HBII52 and unchanged levels of maternally expressed UBE3A compared to controls. Paternal expression abnormalities in the female duplication sample were consistent with elevated DNA methylation of the 15q11-13 imprinting control region (ICR). Expression of non-imprinted 15q11-13 GABA receptor subunit genes was significantly reduced specifically in the female 15q11-13 duplication brain without detectable GABRB3 methylation differences. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that genetic copy number changes combined with additional genetic or environmental influences on epigenetic mechanisms impact outcome and clinical heterogeneity of 15q11-13 duplication syndromes.

TI	Genetic and epigenetic defects at the 6q24 imprinted locus in a cohort of 13 patients with transient neonatal diabetes: new hypothesis raised by the finding of a unique case with hemizygotic deletion in the critical region.
PG	31-7
AB	BACKGROUND: Transient neonatal diabetes (TND) is a rare form of diabetes usually present in the first few days after birth that resolves within 1 year but that has a tendency to recur later in life. It can be associated with chromosome 6 paternal uniparental disomy (UPD), paternal duplications or loss of maternal methylation at the 6q24 imprinted locus. OBJECTIVE: To report on a cohort of 13 sporadic TND cases, including five with birth defects (congenital abnormalities of heart, brain and bone) and eight without. RESULTS: The hallmarks of diabetes were similar in patients with or without 6q24 defects. The chromosome 6 abnormalities in our patients (n = 13) included 2 of 13 (approximately 15.4%) cases of paternal UPD6, 2 of 11 (approximately 18%) cases of complete and 3 of 11 (approximately 27%) cases of partial loss of the maternal methylation signature upstream of ZAC1-HYMAI imprinted genes in non-UPD cases, and 1 of 13 (approximately 7.7%) cases of hemizygotic deletion. CONCLUSION: The deletion was found in a patient with severe congenital abnormalities. This genetic lesion was not reported previously. The hypothesis of an effect on regulatory elements critical for imprinting and tissue-specific gene expression in early development by the deletion is raised. The data presented here may contribute to the diagnosis and the understanding of imprinting in the region.

TI	High frequency of APOB gene mutations causing familial hypobetalipoproteinaemia in patients of Dutch and Spanish descent.
PG	e23
AB	BACKGROUND: Familial hypobetalipoproteinaemia (FHBL) is an autosomal co-dominant hereditary disorder of lipoprotein metabolism characterised by decreased low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein B (APOB) plasma levels. High levels of plasma APOB and LDL cholesterol are strong predictors for risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), while individuals with low APOB and LDL cholesterol levels are thought to have lower than average risk for CVD, and in fact, heterozygous FHBL patients appear to be asymptomatic. METHODS: Rather than identifying truncated APOB proteins in plasma fractions separated by gel electrophoresis, which will miss any mutations in proteins smaller than 30 kb, we analysed the APOB gene directly, using PCR. RESULTS: We identified nine different mutations, six of which are novel. Each mutation showed complete co-segregation with the FHBL phenotype in the families, and statistically significant differences between carriers and non-carriers were found for plasma total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and APOB levels, but not for APOA1 levels. All carriers of an APOB mutation were completely free from CVD. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged low levels of LDL cholesterol and elevated levels of HDL cholesterol may reduce the progression of atherosclerotic disease, but this has not been unequivocally shown that this is indeed the case in individuals with FHBL, and is the subject of a current study.

TI	In frame fibrillin-1 gene deletion in autosomal dominant Weill-Marchesani syndrome.
PG	34-6
AB	Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS) is a connective tissue disorder characterised by short stature, brachydactyly, joint stiffness, and characteristic eye anomalies including microspherophakia, ectopia of the lenses, severe myopia, and glaucoma. Both autosomal recessive (AR) and autosomal dominant (AD) modes of inheritance have been described and a gene for AR WMS has recently been mapped to chromosome 19p13.3-p13.2. Here, we report on the exclusion of chromosome 19p13.3-p13.2 in a large AD WMS family and show that, despite clinical homogeneity, AD and AR WMS are genetically heterogeneous entities. Because two AD WMS families were consistent with linkage to chromosome 15q21.1, the fibrillin-1 gene was sequenced and a 24 nt in frame deletion within a latent transforming growth factor-beta1 binding protein (LTBP) motif of the fibrillin-1 gene was found in a AD WMS family (exon 41, 5074_5097del). This in frame deletion cosegregated with the disease and was not found in 186 controls. This study strongly suggests that AD WMS and Marfan syndrome are allelic conditions at the fibrillin-1 locus and adds to the remarkable clinical heterogeneity of type I fibrillinopathies.

TI	Transient neonatal diabetes, a disorder of imprinting.
PG	872-5
AB	Transient neonatal diabetes (TND) is a rare but distinct type of diabetes. Classically, neonates present with growth retardation and diabetes in the first week of life. Apparent remission occurs by 3 months but there is a tendency for children to develop diabetes in later life. Evidence suggests it is the result of overexpression of an imprinted and paternally expressed gene/s within the TND critical region at 6q24. Two imprinted genes, ZAC (zinc finger protein associated with apoptosis and cell cycle arrest) and HYMAI (imprinted in hydatidiform mole) have been identified as potential candidates. Three genetic mechanisms have been shown to result in TND, paternal uniparental isodisomy of chromosome 6, paternally inherited duplication of 6q24, and a methylation defect at a CpG island overlapping exon 1 of ZAC/HYMAI.

TI	A rapid, PCR based test for differential molecular diagnosis of Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes.
PG	472-5
AB	Approximately 98% of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and 80% of Angelman syndrome (AS) cases have deletions at a common region in chromosome 15q11-13, uniparental disomy for chromosomes 15 (UPD15), or mutations affecting gene expression in this region. The resulting clinical phenotype (PWS or AS) in each class of mutation depends upon the parent of origin. Both disorders are characterised at the molecular level by abnormal methylation of imprinted genes at 15q11-q13 including the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein N gene (SNRPN). Current diagnostic strategies include high resolution cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), Southern blot hybridisation, or microsatellite typing. We have developed a novel and rapid diagnostic test for PWS and AS based on differential digestion of expressed (paternally imprinted) SNRPN sequences by the methylation sensitive endonuclease NotI or repressed (maternally imprinted) SNRPN sequences by the methylation requiring nuclease McrBC, followed by PCR amplification of the SNRPN promoter. We have evaluated this test by blinded analysis of 60 characterised DNA samples (20 PWS, 20 AS, and 20 unaffected controls). SNRPN sequences could not be amplified from PWS patient DNA which had been digested with McrBC, nor from AS patient DNA which had been digested with NotI. We were able to make a correct diagnosis of PWS, AS, or unaffected in all 60 samples tested. This novel test is rapid and has a high specificity and sensitivity for deletion and UPD15 cases. These features make this new test suitable as the initial step in a molecular diagnostic strategy for PWS/AS.

TI	Inherited DNA amplification of the proximal 15q region: cytogenetic and molecular studies.
PG	217-22
AB	In a 15 year old girl, referred for growth retardation, conventional cytogenetic analysis detected an abnormal 15q+ chromosome with extra material in the proximal region, inherited from her father and grandfather. Using various molecular cytogenetic techniques, including comparative genomic hybridisation, we showed that the extra chromatin resulted from in situ amplification of DNA sequences located between the loci D15Z1 and D15S18. On the basis of the clinical features of our patient and the late replication of the large amplified region, we searched for functional modifications in the adjacent Prader-Willi syndrome region.

TI	Counselling dilemmas associated with the molecular characterisation of two Angelman syndrome families.
PG	651-5
AB	We report the molecular characterisation of two families with Angelman syndrome referred for prenatal diagnosis, in which atypical molecular findings resulted in counselling dilemmas. The first is a familial case of Angelman syndrome in which the two affected children have mutations which affect the imprinting mechanism, as shown by the presence of paternal DNA methylation patterns at D15S63 and SNRPN and biparental inheritance of 15q11-q13 markers. DNA prepared from a 21 week fetal blood sample detected a fetus with normal maternal and paternal DNA methylation patterns at D15S63, but inheritance of the same maternal chromosome 15q11-q13 as the two affected sibs. This is probably a result of germline mosaicism in the mother. The second is a case of Angelman syndrome with an atypical deletion of 15q11-q13, which involves both unusual proximal and distal breakpoints. The deletion was characterised in order to assess the risk of Angelman syndrome in a second pregnancy in the mother of this child.

TI	Molecular cytogenetic characterisation of a small ring X chromosome in a Turner patient and in a male patient with congenital abnormalities: role of X inactivation.
PG	113-6
AB	The association of small accessory marker chromosomes in man with specific abnormalities has been difficult to define owing to variations in the chromosome origin and the size of the markers. In a patient with typical Turner phenotype and a 45,X/46,X, + mar karyotype the marker was shown to be a small portion of the long arm of the X chromosome which included the centromere and XIST, a candidate gene for the X inactivation centre. Therefore the lack of any additional abnormalities was attributed to inactivation of the portion of the X chromosome in the marker. In a patient with a 47,XY, + mar karyotype the mar was a small ring X chromosome which did not contain the XIST gene. For both markers the short arm breakpoints were localised between UBE1 and DXS423E. The congenital abnormalities of the male patient were attributed to the lack of X inactivation of the small ring and therefore disomic expression of normal genes possessed by the marker.

TI	Possible role of imprinting in the Turner phenotype.
PG	840-2
AB	We have attempted to investigate the role of imprinting in the phenotype of Turner's syndrome. Sixty-three patients were investigated for parental origin of the retained normal X chromosome; 43 were found to retain the maternal X (XM) and 20 the paternal (XP). The relationship between a child's pretreatment height centile and parental height centiles was examined in 36 patients. No significant correlation was found between child and parental height centiles for XP or child and paternal height centiles for XM (p &gt; 0.05) but a strong correlation was found between child's height centile and maternal height centile (p &lt; 0.01) for XM. Using pooled data from this and other studies there was no significant correlation with renal anomalies but a strong correlation between cardiovascular abnormalities and XM (0.01 &gt; p &gt; 0.001) and neck webbing and XM (p &lt; 0.05). We conclude that imprinting may play a part in the Turner's syndrome phenotype, especially with respect to pretreatment height, cardiovascular anomalies, and neck webbing.

TI	X;Y translocation in a girl with short stature and some features of Turner's syndrome: cytogenetic and molecular studies.
PG	649-51
AB	A 13 year old girl referred for chromosome analysis because of disproportionate short stature (short neck, curved legs, pectus excavatum) with an initial clinical diagnosis of Turner's syndrome was found to have the karyotype 46,X, + der(X) in 100% of her blood lymphocytes. By means of conventional differential staining (QFH/AcD, FPG, and RBA banding) supplemented with distamycin A treatment, the karyotype of the proband was interpreted as 46,X,t(X;Y) (p22.3;q11). The rearranged marker X chromosome was found to be active in 91% of lymphocytes studied. PCR analysis with Y chromosome specific oligoprimers showed the presence of some Y chromosome long arm DNA in both lymphocyte and gonadal tissue biopsy cells. At laparoscopy the patient was found to have small gonads with a rudimentary uterus and fallopian tubes. Histological examination of gonadal tissue showed primary follicles with dystrophic changes of the germ cells and numerous follicular cysts (polycystic ovaries). The proband's phenotype and its correlation with the genetic imbalance of the rearranged X chromosomes, as well as with non-random t(X;Y) chromosome inactivation, are briefly discussed.

TI	Three patients with ring (X) chromosomes and a severe phenotype.
PG	482-6
AB	Three patients with mosaicism and a cell line containing a small ring (X) chromosome are described. Their phenotype is similar to several previously reported patients with a 45,X/46,X,r(X) karyotype and a phenotype far more severely affected than expected in Turner's syndrome. The clinical picture includes mental retardation, a facial appearance reminiscent of the Kabuki make up syndrome, and limb anomalies. Some of the patients also had streaky hyperpigmentation of the skin in a pattern suggesting dermal mosaicism. It has been hypothesised that the severe phenotype might be the result of the small r(X) chromosome remaining active. However, there is little critical evidence to support this suggestion, while there is considerable evidence against it, including (1) a similar phenotype in 45,X/46,X,r(Y) patients, (2) the late replication of some of the small r(X) chromosomes associated with this phenotype, and (3) the expression of XIST in some of the affected patients.

TI	Mutation analysis of AMP-activated protein kinase subunits in inherited cardiomyopathies: implications for kinase function and disease pathogenesis.
PG	1251-5
AB	Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has been defined as a disease of the cardiac sarcomere, although sarcomeric protein mutations are not found in one third of cases. We have recently shown that HCM associated with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) and conduction disease can be caused by mutations in PRKAG2, which encodes the gamma2 subunit of AMPK, an enzyme central to cellular energy homeostasis. AMPK is a heterotrimer composed of one catalytic subunit (alpha) and two regulatory subunits (beta and gamma). Seven known genes encode the subunit isoforms (alpha1, alpha2, beta1, beta2, gamma1, gamma2, gamma3) and all are expressed in the heart. To better understand the role of AMPK mutations in HCM/WPW and other inherited cardiomyophathies, all 7 subunit genes were screened for mutations in a panel of probands: 3 with HCM/WPW, 4 with DCM/WPW, 38 with HCM alone (in whom contractile protein mutations had not been found) and 13 with DCM alone. In total, 73 amplimers were screened in the 58 probands and a number of polymorphisms, including non-conservative substitutions, were identified. However, no further disease-causing mutations were found in any AMPK subunit gene. These results indicate that HCM with WPW is a distinct, but genetically heterogeneous, condition caused by mutations in PRKAG2 and in an unknown gene or genes, not involved in the AMPK complex. Mutations in PRKAG2 appear to specifically cause HCM with WPW and conduction disease, and not other inherited cardiomyopathies. As deleterious alleles were not found in other AMPK subunit isoforms, the mutations affecting PRKAG2 are likely to confer a specific alteration of AMPK function of particular importance in the myocardium.

TI	Novel deletions in MYH7 and MYBPC3 identified in Indian families with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
PG	623-36
AB	Mutations causing familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) have been described in at least 11 genes encoding cardiac sarcomeric proteins. In this study, three previously unknown deletions have been identified in the human cardiac genes coding for beta-myosin heavy chain (MYH7 on chromosome 14) and myosin-binding protein-C (MYBPC3 on chromosome 11). In family MM, a 3-bp deletion in MYH7 was detected to be associated with loss of glutamic acid in position 927 (DeltaE927) of the myosin rod. In two other families (HH and NP, related by a common founder) a 2-bp loss in codon 453 (exon 16) of MYBPC3 was identified as the presumable cause of a translation reading frame shift. Taken together 15 living mutation carriers were investigated. Six deceased family members (with five cases of premature sudden cardiac death (SCD) in families MM and NP) were either obligate or suspected mutation carriers. In addition to these mutations a 25-bp deletion in intron 32 of MYBPC3 was identified in family MM (five carriers) and in a fourth family (MiR, one HCM patient, three deletion carriers). In agreement with the loss of the regular splicing branch point in the altered intron 32, a splicing deficiency was observed in an exon trapping experiment using MYBPC3 exon 33 as a test substrate. Varying disease profiles assessed using standard clinical, ECG and echocardiographic procedures in conjunction with mutation analysis led to the following conclusions: (1) In family MM the DeltaE927 deletion in MYH7 was assumed to be associated with complete penetrance. Two cases of reported SCD might have been related to this mutation. (2) The two families, HH and NP, distantly related by a common founder, and both suffering from a 2-bp deletion in exon 16 of MYBPC3 differed in their average phenotypes. In family NP, four cases of cardiac death were documented, whereas no cardiac-related death was reported from family HH. These results support the notion that mutations in HCM genes may directly determine disease penetrance and severity; however, a contribution of additional, unidentified factors (genes) to the HCM phenotype can-at least in some cases-not be excluded. (3) The deletion in intron 32 of MYBPC3 was seen in two families, but in both its relation to disease was not unequivocal. In addition, this deletion was observed in 16 of 229 unrelated healthy individuals of the population of the South Indian states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. It was not seen in 270 Caucasians from Russia and western Europe. Hence, it is considered to represent a regional genetic polymorphism restricted to southern India. The association of the deletion with altered splicing in transfected cells suggests that this deletion may create a &quot;modifying gene&quot;, which is per se not or only rarely causing HCM, but which may enhance the phenotype of a mutation responsible for disease.

TI	Allelic dropout can cause false-positive results for Prader-Willi and Angelman syndrome testing.
PG	108-12
AB	The diagnosis of many genetic disorders relies on a combination of clinical suspicion and confirmatory genetic testing. Our laboratory uses a standard methylation-sensitive PCR (MSP) to target the differentially methylated SNRPN gene to test for Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome. One patient, a 27-month-old female, who lacked the classical clinical features of PWS, but had a molecular diagnosis of PWS by MSP by another laboratory, had repeat testing in our laboratory. Testing by MSP in our laboratory also identified an apparent loss of the unmethylated paternal allele, consistent with a diagnosis of PWS. Confirmatory testing using Southern blot analysis with a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme showed a normal pattern of methylation, detecting both the methylated maternal and unmethylated paternal alleles. To investigate these discrepant results, we amplified and sequenced the SNRPN locus in this patient and identified a single nucleotide change within the binding site for the unmethylated DNA-specific primer. These results indicate this nucleotide change led to allelic dropout in the MSP analysis, yielding the false-positive result. Subsequently, MSP analysis using an alternate primer set that was developed by our laboratory detected both methylated and unmethylated alleles. These findings illustrate that allelic dropout due to the presence of rare polymorphisms can cause false-positive results in commonly used MSP assays and lead to molecular misdiagnosis.

TI	Molecular characterization of WFS1 in patients with Wolfram syndrome.
PG	88-95
AB	Wolfram (diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness) syndrome is a rare autosomal-recessive neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, diabetes insipidus, and sensorineural hearing impairment. A gene responsible for Wolfram syndrome (WFS1) has been identified on the short arm of chromosome 4 and subsequently mutations in WFS1 have been described. We have screened 12 patients with Wolfram syndrome from nine Dutch families for mutations in the WFS1-coding region by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing. Furthermore, we analyzed the mitochondrial genome for gross abnormalities and the A3243G point mutation in the leucyl-tRNA gene, because Wolfram syndrome shows phenotypic similarities with mitochondrial disease. Seven mutations in WFS1 were identified in six of nine families: two missense mutations, one frameshift mutation, one splice donor site mutation, and three deletions. In addition, a splice variant near the 5'UTR of WFS1 was identified, present in patient as well as control RNA samples in various percentages, alternating the translation initiation consensus sequence. Whether this WFS1 splice variant displays impaired translation efficiency remains to be determined. No MtDNA lesions were identified in any of the Wolfram patients. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of molecular analysis of WFS1 in the refinement of clinical diagnostic criteria for Wolfram syndrome that helps to dissect the clinically overlapping syndromes sharing diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy.

TI	Developmental origins of disease and determinants of chromatin structure: maternal diet modifies the primate fetal epigenome.
PG	91-102
AB	Chromatin structure is epigenetically altered via covalent modifications of histones to allow for heritable gene regulation without altering the nucleotide sequence. Multiple lines of evidence from rodents have established a role for epigenetic remodeling in regulating gene transcription in response to an altered gestational milieu. However, to date, it is unknown whether variations in the intrauterine environment in primates similarly induce changes in key determinants of hepatic chromatin structure. We hypothesized that a maternal high-fat diet would alter the epigenomic profile of the developing offspring, which would result in alterations in fetal gene expression. Age	and weight-matched adult female Japanese macaques were placed on control (13% fat) or high-fat (35% fat) breeder diets and mated annually over a 4-year interval. Fetuses in successive years were delivered near term (e130 of 167 days) and underwent necropsy with tissue harvest. Fetal histones were acid extracted for characterization of H3 modification and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with differential display PCR; fetal RNA, DNA, and cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extracts were similarly extracted for comparison. Chronic consumption of a maternal high-fat diet results in a threefold increase in fetal liver triglycerides and histologic correlates of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. These gross changes in the fetal liver are accompanied by a statistically significant hyperacetylation of fetal hepatic tissue at H3K14 (199.85+/-9.64 vs 88.8+/-45.4; P=0.038) with a trend towards the increased acetylation at H3K9 (140.9+/-38.7 vs 46.6+/-6.53; P=0.097) and at H3K18 (69.0+/-3.54 vs 58.0+/-4.04; P=0.096). However, epigenetic modifications on fetal hepatic H3 associated with gene repression were absent or subtle (P&gt;0.05). Subsequent characterization of key epigenetic determinants associated with H3 acetylation marks revealed similar significant alterations in association with a high-fat maternal diet (e.g., relative fetal histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) gene expression 0.61+/-0.25; P=0.011). Consistent with our mRNA expression profile, fetal nuclear extracts from offspring of high-fat diet animals were observed to be significantly relatively deplete of HDAC1 protein (36.07+/-6.73 vs 83.18+/-7.51; P=0.006) and in vitro HDAC functional activity (0.252+/-0.03 vs 0.698+/-0.02; P&lt;0.001). We employ these observations in ChIP differential display PCR to attempt to identify potential fetal genes whose expression is reprogramed under conditions of a high-fat maternal diet. We quantitatively confirm a minimum of a 40% alteration in the expression of several genes of interest: glutamic pyruvate transaminase (alanine aminotransferase) 2 (GPT2) (1.59+/-0.23-fold; P=0.08), DNAJA2 (1.36+/-0.21; P=0.09), and Rdh12 (1.88+/-0.15; P=0.01) are appreciably increased in fetal hepatic tissue from maternal caloric-dense diet animals when compared with control while Npas2, a peripheral circadian regulator, was significantly downmodulated in the offspring of high-fat diet animals (0.66+/-0.08; P=0.03). In this study, we show that a current significant in utero exposure (caloric-dense high-fat maternal diet) induces site-specific alterations in fetal hepatic H3 acetylation. Employing ChIP, we extend these observations to link modifications of H3 acetylation with alterations in gene-specific expression. These results suggest that a caloric-dense maternal diet leading to obesity epigenetically alters fetal chromatin structure in primates via covalent modifications of histones and hence lends a molecular basis to the fetal origins of adult disease hypothesis.

TI	Cardiac-targeted RNA interference mediated by an AAV9 vector improves cardiac function in coxsackievirus B3 cardiomyopathy.
PG	987-97
AB	RNA interference (RNAi) has potential to be a novel therapeutic strategy in diverse areas of medicine. In this paper, we report on targeted RNAi for the treatment of a viral cardiomyopathy, which is a major cause of sudden cardiac death or terminal heart failure in children and young adults. RNAi therapy employs small regulatory RNAs to achieve its effect, but in vivo use of synthetic small interfering RNAs is limited by instability in plasma and low transfer into target cells. We instead evaluated an RNAi strategy using short hairpin RNA (shRdRp) directed at the RNA polymerase (RdRP) of coxsackievirus B3 (CoxB3) in HeLa cells, primary rat cardiomyocytes (PNCMs) and CoxB3-infected mice in vivo. A conventional AAV2 vector expressing shRdRp protected HeLa against virus-induced death, but this vector type was unable to transduce PNCMs. In contrast, an analogous pseudotyped AAV2.6 vector was protective also in PNCMs and reduced virus replication by &gt;3 log10 steps. Finally, we evaluated the intravenous treatment of mice with an AAV2.9-shRdRp vector because AAV9 carries the most cardiotropic AAV capsid currently known for in vivo use. Mice with CoxB3 cardiomyopathy had disturbed left ventricular (LV) function with impaired parameters of contractility (dP/dtmax = 3,006 +/	287 vs. 7,482 +/	487 mmHg/s, p &lt; 0.01) and diastolic relaxation (dP/dtmin = -2,224 +/	195 vs. -6,456 +/	356 mmHg/s, p &lt; 0.01 and Tau = 16.2 +/	1.1 vs. 10.7 +/	0.6 ms, p &lt; 0.01) compared to control mice. AAV2.9-shRdRp treatment significantly attenuated the cardiac dysfunction compared to control vector-treated mice on day 10 after CoxB3 infection: dP/dtmax = 3,865 +/	354 vs. 3,006 +/	287 mmHg/s (p &lt; 0.05), dP/dtmin = -3,245 +/	231 vs. -2,224 +/	195 mmHg/s (p &lt; 0.05) and Tau = 11.9 +/	0.5 vs. 16.2 +/	1.1 ms (p &lt; 0.01). The data show, for the first time, that intravenously injected AAV9 has the potential to target RNAi to the heart and suggest AAV9-shRNA vectors as a novel therapeutic approach for cardiac disorders.

TI	The contribution of individual and pairwise combinations of SNPs in the APOA1 and APOC3 genes to interindividual HDL-C variability.
PG	561-72
AB	Apolipoproteins (apo) A-I and C-III are components of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), a quantitative trait negatively correlated with risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We analyzed the contribution of individual and pairwise combinations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the APOA1/APOC3 genes to HDL-C variability to evaluate (1) consistency of published single-SNP studies with our single-SNP analyses; (2) consistency of single-SNP and two-SNP phenotype-genotype relationships across race-, gender-, and geographical location-dependent contexts; and (3) the contribution of single SNPs and pairs of SNPs to variability beyond that explained by plasma apo A-I concentration. We analyzed 45 SNPs in 3,831 young African-American (N=1,858) and European-American (N=1,973) females and males ascertained by the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. We found three SNPs that significantly impact HDL-C variability in both the literature and the CARDIA sample. Single-SNP analyses identified only one of five significant HDL-C SNP genotype relationships in the CARDIA study that was consistent across all race-, gender-, and geographical location-dependent contexts. The other four were consistent across geographical locations for a particular race-gender context. The portion of total phenotypic variance explained by single-SNP genotypes and genotypes defined by pairs of SNPs was less than 3%, an amount that is miniscule compared to the contribution explained by variability in plasma apo A-I concentration. Our findings illustrate the impact of context-dependence on SNP selection for prediction of CVD risk factor variability.

TI	Influence of Angiotensin-converting enzyme polymorphism on neuropsychological subacute performance in moderate and severe traumatic brain injury.
PG	39-44
AB	Traumatic brain injury (TBI) frequently results in cerebrovascular lesions that may increase secondary damage and cause neuropsychological impairment. Previous studies suggest an association among the insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), cardiovascular disease, and cognitive performance. Clinical and experimental studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitor treatment on vascular injury, hypertension, brain ischemia, and cognitive functioning. In a sample of 73 moderate and severe TBI patients, the authors assessed whether cognitive sequelae differed in relation to the ACE I/D polymorphism. D allele carrier patients performed worse than those with I/I polymorphism on tests involving attention and processing speed. Findings suggest that the physiopathological changes associated with TBI may have greater consequences in ACE D allele carriers.

TI	Polyunsaturated fatty acids modulate the effect of TCF7L2 gene variants on postprandial lipemia.
PG	439-46
AB	The transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) has been recently associated with diabetes risk, and it may exert its effect through metabolic syndrome (MetS)-related traits and be subjected to modification by environmental factors. We investigated the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), rs7903146 and rs12255372, within the TCF7L2 locus on postprandial lipemia and other MetS-related traits and their modulation by dietary fat. Data were collected from 1083 European Americans participating in the Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network Study. Carriers of the minor T allele at the C/T rs7903146 SNP had higher fasting plasma glucose (P = 0.012), lower homeostasis model assessment of beta cell function (P = 0.041), higher plasma VLDL (P = 0.035), and lower large LDL particle (P = 0.007) concentrations and higher risk of MetS (P = 0.011) than CC individuals. Moreover, we identified significant interactions between this SNP and PUFA intake modulating fasting VLDL particle concentrations (P = 0.016) and postprandial triglycerides (TG) (P = 0.028), chylomicrons (P = 0.025), total VLDL (P = 0.026), and large VLDL (P = 0.018) concentrations. Thus, only T allele carriers with a PUFA intake &gt; or = 7.36% of energy had elevated fasting plasma VLDL concentrations and postprandial TG-rich lipoproteins. These variables did not differ in T allele carriers and noncarriers in the low-PUFA intake group. Moreover, these significant interactions were due exclusively to (n-6) PUFA intake. In summary, high (n-6) PUFA intakes (&gt; or = 6.62% of energy intake) were associated with atherogenic dyslipidemia in carriers of the minor T allele at the TCF7L2 rs7903146 SNP and may predispose them to MetS, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.

TI	Interactions between arsenic-induced toxicity and nutrition in early life.
PG	2798-804
AB	Exposure to arsenic through drinking water is a major public health problem affecting most countries, although the situation is particularly severe in low-income nations. The health consequences of chronic arsenic exposure include increased risk for various forms of cancer and numerous noncancer effects, including diabetes, skin diseases, chronic cough, and toxic effects on liver, kidney, cardiovascular system, and peripheral and central nervous systems. In recent years increasing reports of effects on fetal and child development have appeared. There seems to be a wide variation in susceptibility to arsenic toxicity, which is likely to be related to factors such as variation in arsenic metabolism, nutrition, host-related defense mechanisms, and genetic predisposition. The main mechanisms of arsenic-nutrition interactions include arsenic-induced oxidative stress, which requires nutrient-dependent defense systems, and arsenic metabolism (methylation) via 1-carbon metabolism, which requires methyl groups, folic acid, vitamin B-12, and betaine for the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. An efficient first methylation step in combination with a slow second methylation step seems to be most critical from a toxicological point of view. A third mode of arsenic-nutrition interaction involves epigenetic effects and fetal programming via DNA methylation.

TI	Plasma homocysteine concentrations in Greek children are influenced by an interaction between the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T genotype and folate status.
PG	383-8
AB	Risk factors established at young ages may set the stage for later cardiovascular disease (CVD). Elevated total homocysteine (tHcy) in blood is an emerging risk factor for CVD, yet few studies have been conducted in children, especially in the Mediterranean. We described plasma tHcy concentrations in a group of healthy Greek children and examined its relation with physiologic, metabolic, and genetic variables. Fasting blood samples were collected from 186 students, 11.6 +/	0.4 years old, and tHcy, folate, vitamin B-12, and routine biochemistry variables in plasma were measured. The methylenetetrahydrolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T genotype was determined and anthropometric and dietary data were obtained. The distribution of tHcy was positively skewed with a median of 7.9 micromol/L (mean: 8.2 +/	2.3 micromol/L; range: 4.4-22.2 micromol/L). tHcy was inversely related to plasma folate (r = -0.34, P &lt; 0.0001), vitamin B-12 (r = -0.20, P = 0.008), and glucose (r = -0.15, P = 0.045). An interaction between the MTHFR genotype and plasma folate on tHcy was detected (P = 0.047). Specifically, the homozygous mutant TT genotype was associated with higher tHcy only in children with lower plasma folate (&lt; 19.9 nmol/L), (P = 0.012). In our sample of healthy Greek children, plasma tHcy concentrations were higher than values reported in children of Northern European descent and were associated with folate, vitamin B-12, and glucose in plasma. The results also show that, similar to adults, plasma folate concentration is important in determining the contribution of the MTHFR C677T mutation to tHcy concentrations in children.

TI	Angiotensin-converting enzyme gene insertion/deletion polymorphism frequency in normotensive children with a positive family history of essential hypertension.
PG	742-6
AB	AIM: To evaluate the possible relationship between blood pressure (BP) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism in normotensive children with a positive family history of essential hypertension (EHT). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three hundred seventy-six randomly selected normotensive schoolchildren (147 boys, 229 girls) between the ages of seven and 17 years were enrolled. Children were subdivided into a 'first-degree relative group' and a 'second-degree relative group' according to the presence of EHT in parents or grandparents, respectively. BP was measured twice from the right arm and the systolic BP, diastolic BP and mean BP were recorded. ACE gene I/D polymorphism was performed from all studied children and frequency od DD, ID and ID allele were analysed in each study group. RESULTS: Allelic frequencies of the DD genotype of the ACE gene were higher in children with a positive history in the first	(36.2%) and second-degree (38.3%) relatives for EHT than the controls (30.7%) (P &lt; 0.05 for both). Children with a positive family history of EHT and a DD genotype, had significantly higher SBP, DBP and MBP levels (P &lt; 0.05) than the children with ID or II genotypes. CONCLUSION: We found that the ACE gene DD genotype was common and that BP levels were higher in Turkish children with a positive family history of EHT and DD genotype. Because the presence of DD allele might be the one of the potential contributor of EHT pathogenesis, further studies needed in large cohort for long term follow-up for EHT in children with DD allele.

AB	The methylation test can make the diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) in approximately 99% of patients and is confirmed as a reliable, robust screening test. In a patient with PWS, methylation analysis does not provide the mechanism, for which other different genetic tests are required. Appropriate tests are available in each Australian state.

TI	Prader-Willi syndrome.
PG	331-4
AB	Prader-Willi syndrome is a multi system disorder characterized by neonatal hypotonia, later obesity, hyperphagia and mental retardation. It occurs sporadically, either as a result of microdeletion of chromosome 15p (70%) or as a result of maternal disomy of chromosome 15 (30%). The major problems encountered by parents are those of hyperphagia, food-seeking and obesity, and conduct disorder, particularly tantrums or oppositional behaviour.

TI	Down-regulation of ATM protein in HRS cells of nodular sclerosis Hodgkin's lymphoma in children occurs in the absence of ATM gene inactivation.
PG	329-36
AB	The tumour component of classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (cHL), Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells, are believed to be derived from germinal centre (GC) B cells but intriguingly display a characteristic loss of B cell receptor (BCR) expression. The precise mechanisms by which BCR-negative HRS cell progenitors survive negative selection during the GC reaction remain obscure. Individuals with ataxia telangiectasia, caused by biallelic inactivation of the DNA damage response gene, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), have a higher risk of cHL development. Here we show that, in contrast to normal GC B cells that expressed low but detectable ATM protein, ATM protein was not detected in HRS cells of 17/18 cases of paediatric cHL, all but one with nodular sclerosis (NS) subtype. A comprehensive analysis of the ATM gene in microdissected HRS cells of nine representative tumours showed no evidence of either loss of heterozygosity or consistent pathogenic mutations. Furthermore, bisulphite sequencing of the ATM promoter from HRS cells of five tumours also revealed the absence of hypermethylation. Since our microarray data suggested significantly reduced ATM transcription in HRS cells compared to GC B cells, we conclude that loss of ATM expression could be the result of alterations in upstream regulators of ATM transcription. Importantly, ATM loss in paediatric cHLs has clinical implications and could be potentially exploited to guide future, less toxic, tumour-specific treatments.

TI	Angiotensin-converting enzyme DD genotype is associated with worse perinatal cardiorespiratory adaptation in preterm infants.
PG	746-9
AB	OBJECTIVES: The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) deletion (D) variant is associated with greater ACE activity and perhaps with deleterious cardiorespiratory pathophysiological responses. We determined whether the early health status of the preterm infant was adversely influenced by homozygosity for the D allele (DD genotype) compared with ID or II genotype. Study design Angiotensin-converting enzyme genotype was determined in a cohort of 148 preterm infants born in Bristol, United Kingdom (median gestational age, 31 weeks; range, 28-32). Intensive care data were prospectively obtained. Primary analysis was by Mann-Whitney U and chi(2) tests. RESULTS: Higher oxygen, circulatory support requirements, and base deficit in the first 12 hours after birth were found in infants with DD genotype (minimum inspired oxygen concentration in first 12 hours, median [interquartile range], DD 0.26 [0.21-0.40], ID/II 0.21 [0.21-0.30], P=.028; blood pressure support in first 12 hours, DD 12 [30%], ID/II 15 [14%], P=.039; worse base deficit in first 12 hours, DD 4.8 [7.7 to 0], ID/II 0 [5.3 to 0], P=.020). CONCLUSIONS: Angiotensin-converting enzyme polymorphism has a role in the development of preterm cardiorespiratory disease. The DD genotype, encoding higher angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, may adversely influence the early health status of preterm infants.

AB	We report on a phenotypically normal girl with a deletion of the distal long arm of one X chromosome at Xq22, and spontaneous pubertal development including menarche. This suggests that the distal long arm of the X chromosome is not crucial for ovarian development. Cytogenetic and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification methods both showed preferential inactivation of the deleted X chromosome. The PCR-based assay has the additional advantage of identifying the paternal origin of the deleted X chromosome.

TI	Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N quantitative methylation analysis in infants with central hypotonia.
PG	595-8
AB	Central hypotonic is one of the most difficult issues in neurology, ruling out neurogenetic syndromic causes is critical, Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) it is the most frequent genetic syndrome, it is caused by the loss of expression of the paternal allele in a group of imprinted genes within 15q11-q13, and is characterized by severe prenatal and postnatal hypotonia. SNURF-SNRPN gene methylation detects 99% of the cases but fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis is necessary to confirm chromosome microdeletions. The advantage of SNRP-quantitative strategy of methylated alleles is that it makes it possible to make the diagnosis and identify deletions and mosaicism in one reaction. In infants clinical diagnosis is difficult. It has been proposed that around 40% of hypotonic patients have PWS but an accurate percentage has not been established. Twenty-four central hypotonic infants were studied by this molecular strategy, showing 41.5% with the disease. This molecular approach also permitted calculation of gene dosage and detection of those cases with microdeletion.

TI	A single base-pair deletion in the WFS1 gene causes Wolfram syndrome.
PG	389-91
AB	Wolfram syndrome is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder also known as DIDMOAD (diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy and deafness). The majority of cases are caused by mutations in the WFS1 gene. WFS1 is located at 4p16.1 and encodes wolframin, a transmembrane endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein involved in the negative regulation of ER stress signalling. To date, over 120 WFS1 mutations have been described. In this study, we report a consanguineous family with three siblings affected by Wolfram syndrome. A homozygous single base pair deletion (c.877delC, L293fsX303) was found in the WFS1 gene in all three affected siblings.

TI	A new variant of a known mutation in two siblings with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus.
PG	373-5
AB	Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus is a rare disorder usually presenting within the first few weeks or months of life. This disorder is genetically heterogeneous and has been associated with mutations in various genes. The genetic cause remains mostly unknown although several genes have been linked to this disorder. Mutations in KCNJ11, ABCC8, or INS are the cause of permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus in about 50%-60% of the patients. With genetic studies, we hope to increase our knowledge of neonatal diabetes, whereby new treatment models can become possible. Here, we defined a new variant of a known mutation, INS Exon 1-3 homozygous deletion, in two siblings diagnosed with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus.

TI	PPAR-gamma2 pro12Ala polymorphism is associated with post-challenge abnormalities of glucose homeostasis in children and adolescents with obesity.
PG	55-9
AB	AIM: The aim of the study was to investigate the association between PPAR-gamma2 Pro12Ala polymorphism and laboratory characteristics of carbohydrate metabolism in children and adolescents with obesity. In addition, serum levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and soluble form of its receptors (sTNFR1 and sTNFR2) were assessed. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 79 obese children and adolescents of Caucasian origin were investigated. PPAR-gamma2 Pro12Ala polymorphism was determined using polymerase chain reaction--restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. Serum levels of TNF-alpha, sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 were measured by enzyme amplified sensitivity immunoassay. RESULTS: The minor Ala allele frequency was found to be 14.56% in our cohort. No significant differences in age, BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, serum lipid, uric acid, TNF-alpha, sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 values were found between carriers of the Ala allele (Pro/Ala and Ala/Ala; n=21) vs. homozygous carriers of the Pro allele (Pro/Pro; n=58). However, post-challenge (120 min) plasma glucose and insulin values were significantly lower in Ala allele carriers vs. homozygous Pro allele carriers (6.56 +/	0.26 vs. 7.36 +/	0.25 mmol/L and 65.9 +/	13.8 vs. 111.8 +/	20.7 microU/mL, respectively; p &lt; 0.05); while no significant differences were found at fasting state. CONCLUSIONS: The association between PPAR-gamma2 Prol2Ala polymorphism and glucose metabolism is already present in children and adolescents with obesity who might be at the very beginning of the natural course of type 2 diabetes. At this stage, higher insulin sensitivity can be detected in Ala allele carriers compared to homozygous Pro subjects at post-challenge but not in fasting state; however, the TNF-system seems not to be involved in the alteration of glucose homeostasis due to PPAR-gamma2 Pro12Ala polymorphism.

TI	The involvement of insulin receptor genotypes in pre	and co-obese acanthosis Nigricans children and adolescent.
PG	653-60
AB	Acanthosis nigricans (AN) is most commonly related to obesity as a manifestation of cutaneous insulin resistance in children and adolescents, while the interaction and time course between AN and obesity and detailed mechanism for the pre	and co-obese appearance of AN (PCOAN) in child are unclear. In this study, the involvement of insulin receptor in child PCOAN was investigated via studying the association of polymorphisms of INSR gene with PCOAN. In total, 99 children with PCOAN and 100 healthy controls recruited were genotyped and analyzed by PCR-RFLP method. Significantly different distributions were found in the frequency of the INSR His1085His genotypes, but not in other INSR genotypes, between the two groups. Our results provide not only the evidence that the T allele of INSR His1085His is correlated with the appearance of PCOAN but revealed that the insulin receptor pathway may play an important role in this PCOAN.

TI	No evidence for additional imprinting defects in Silver-Russell syndrome patients with maternal uniparental disomy 7 or 11p15 epimutation.
PG	1329-31
AB	Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) is mainly characterised by intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation (IUGR and PNGR), asymmetry, clinodactyly V and craniofacial abnormalities. More than 35% of patients carry a hypomethylation of the telomeric imprinting centre region 1 (ICR1) in 11p15; single patients show a maternal duplication of 11p15. An additional 7-10% of patients with SRS have maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7 (mUPD7). Another disorder caused by epigenetic defects is transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM) which is associated with loss of methylation (LOM) in 6q24. After detecting methylation loss at multiple imprinted loci in patients with TNDM, Mackay et al. recently proposed the existence of a maternal hypomethylation syndrome presenting as TNDM. They therefore concluded that patients with other disorders associated with LOM at one (maternally) methylated locus might also carry LOM at multiple loci. Similar observations have also been reported in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS): nearly 25% of patients displayed abnormal methylation patterns of ICRs additional to those in 11p15. To show whether general hypomethylation is a common phenomenon in imprinting disorders we carried out methylation analyses for the imprinted regions 14q32, 6q24 and the centromeric imprinting region ICR2 on 11p15 for 10 patients with SRS carrying mUPD7 and 22 patients with LOM at the telomeric imprinting region ICR1. We showed that further epigenetic defects did not occur in the groups of SRS with LOM of ICR1 or mUPD7, and that these subentities do not belong to the diseases with a general hypomethylation defect, such as TNDM and BWS.

TI	Mosaic Turner syndrome and hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia.
PG	1451-7
AB	BACKGROUND: A common and well recognised feature of Turner's syndrome (partial or total monosomy X) is impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes mellitus. A small percentage of patients with Turner's syndrome have a complex mosaic karyotype with atypical clinical features and mental retardation. METHODS/PATIENT: We report the first case of a child with a complex mosaic Turner genotype and hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia responsive to diazoxide therapy. RESULTS: Cytogenetic analysis showed four cell lines: one with 45,X; the others with an additional small ring chromosome, a small marker chromosome, and both the ring and marker chromosomes, respectively. FISH studies showed the abnormal chromosomes to originate from an X. The X inactivation locus (XIST) was present in the ring, but not in the marker chromosome. CONCLUSIONS: The recognition of hypoglycaemia in children with atypical Turner's syndrome is important as persistent hypoglycaemia may lead to brain damage in addition to the risk of mental retardation. Further studies are required to understand whether the mosaic over--or underexpression of unidentified X chromosome gene(s) in the pancreatic beta-cells leads to hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia.

TI	Imprinting disorders: non-Mendelian mechanisms affecting growth.
PG	1279-88
AB	Most autosomal genes are expressed from both maternal and paternal alleles. However, imprinted genes are an example of non-Mendelian genetics, in which only one member of the gene pair is expressed and expression is determined by the parent of origin. Imprinted genes may account for 0.1-1% of all mammalian genes. At least 50 imprinted genes have been identified in humans, and imprinted genes frequently cluster under the control of an imprinting center. Many imprinted genes contribute to growth, either as growth factors, such as insulin-like growth factors (IGF2 in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome), or as growth inhibitors, such as the GRB10 gene in Russell-Silver syndrome. Imprinted genes have evolved over time in mammals to fine-tune the growth of the fetus. Paternally expressed genes generally enhance growth, whereas maternally expressed genes appear to suppress growth. In addition, normal and abnormal genomic imprinting and loss of heterozygosity contribute to a wide range of malignancies. A common process for controlling gene activity is methylation, which can be changed during male or female gametogenesis. Examples of classic human disorders related to genomic imprinting are Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (chromosome 11), Prader-Willi/Angelman syndromes (chromosome 15), Russell-Silver syndrome (chromosome 7), and Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (chromosome 20). Several of these disorders are discussed and illustrated.

TI	Interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels and IL-6, TNF-polymorphisms in children with thrombosis.
PG	26-31
AB	Infection has an important role in the pathogenesis of thrombosis and it becomes more prominent in childhood cases, in whom the infection frequency is higher. It has been suggested that patients with high tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 levels might be at increased risk of developing thrombotic complications owing to the effects of these cytokines on the coagulation pathway. Functional polymorphisms in the promoter regions of the genes coding for TNF-alpha and IL-6 are associated with increased plasma levels of these cytokines. The aims of this study were to evaluate the serum levels of acute phase reactants, such as C-reactive protein, and of cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-6) and to investigate the association between the TNF-alpha-308 G/A and IL-6-174 G/C polymorphisms in Turkish pediatric patients with thrombosis. Fifty-eight children with thrombosis (group 1) and 89 controls (group 2) were included in the study. Patients who had a history of infection within the 15 days before thrombosis were classified as group 1a and those who had no infection history before thrombosis were classified as group 1b. Serum TNF-alpha did not differ significantly between the groups. However, the IL-6 level was higher in group 1a than in group 1b (P&lt;0.05). The genotype distribution and allele frequencies of TNF-alpha G/A polymorphism were significantly higher in the thrombotic children without infection and in the control group than in the thrombotic children with an infection history (P&lt;0.05). The IL-6-174 C/C genotype was significantly higher in thrombotic children with an infection history (P&lt;0.05); there were no differences between the groups in mean allele frequency (Table 2). On the basis of our results, patients with a history of infection seem to have higher C-reactive protein and IL-6 levels and IL-6-174 C/C genotype. Furthermore, venous thrombosis is more frequent in this group than arterial thrombosis (P&lt;0.05).

TI	Homocysteine, MTHFR C677 T, vitamin B12, and folate levels in Thai children with ischemic stroke: a case-control study.
PG	803-8
AB	Hyperhomocysteinemia has been identified as a risk factor for venous and arterial thrombosis especially in adult populations. Twenty-eight patients with an initial diagnosis of ischemic stroke and 100 controls, aged &lt;or=18 years, were enrolled in this study. The mean plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) levels in patients and controls were significantly different with values of 8.7+/-3.6 and 7.5+/-2.4 micromol/L, respectively (P=0.01). The plasma tHcy at the 95th percentile was 11.5 micromol/L and patients whose plasma tHcy was above the 95th percentile had an odds ratio of 8.2 (95% confidence interval 1.4-47.2, P=0.02) for developing ischemic stroke. The genetic and acquired factors that could have affected plasma tHcy levels were studied and no differences were found between patients and controls. Factors that were investigated were vitamin B12, red blood cell folate, and serum folate levels as well as methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T polymorphism. It is of note, however, that subjects whose plasma tHcy was above the 95th percentile had significantly lower serum folate levels (P=0.02).

TI	Correlation of the C677T MTHFR genotype with homocysteine levels in children with sickle cell disease.
PG	397-400
AB	Recently, a mild to moderate elevation in the plasma homocysteine (Hcy) level has been found to be an important risk factor for stroke. Homozygosity for a common mutation (C677T) in the gene encoding for the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) involved in Hcy metabolism has been associated with increased levels of Hcy. To determine the role of hyperhomocysteinemia in the pathogenesis of stroke in children with sickle cell disease (SCD), Hcy levels and C677T MTHFR genotype were determined in 40 patients homozygous for hemoglobin SS and compared with 197 healthy children. Eleven of 40 patients with SCD had a history of stroke. The prevalence of homozygosity for the C677T MTHFR variant was 5% in the patients with SCD. The median Hcy level was 5.8 micromol/L in the patients versus 5.4 micromol/L in the controls (Fisher's, P &gt; 0.05). There was no correlation of Hcy levels with the MTHFR genotype in patients with SCD. In patients with SCD and stroke, the median Hcy level was 4.8 micromol/L versus 6.0 micromol/L in those without stroke (P = 0.44, Mann-Whitney rank sum test). There was no difference in the proportion of patients with SCD with or without stroke who were homozygous for the C677T MTHFR mutation (0/11 versus 2/29; Fisher's, P = 1.000). In conclusion, this study failed to demonstrate an elevation in plasma Hcy levels in children with SCD compared with normal controls. Furthermore, hyperhomocysteinemia did not seem to be a significant factor in the pathogenesis of stroke in children with SCD.

TI	Increased prevalence of ADHD in Turner syndrome with no evidence of imprinting effects.
PG	945-55
AB	BACKGROUND: Turner syndrome (TS) results from the loss of part or all of one X chromosome in females. It can result in short stature, various dysmorphic findings, and difficulties with psychosocial adjustment. Girls with TS have previously been found to exhibit increased levels of hyperactivity and inattention. However, no studies have assessed whether individuals with TS meet strict (DSM-IV) criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). OBJECTIVE: We looked at the prevalence of ADHD in girls with TS and evaluated the contribution of imprinting on cognitive performance (IQ) and ADHD. METHODS: We tested 50 girls with TS for ADHD, IQ, academic performance, and parental origin of the X chromosome. RESULTS: We report an 18-fold increase in the prevalence of ADHD in girls with TS (24%) compared with girls in the general population (1.3%) (p &lt; .01) and a 4.8 fold increase when compared with boys and girls in the general population (5%) (p &lt; .05). In contrast to previous reports, our molecular studies in females with 45,X also showed no association between IQ scores and the parental origin of the intact X chromosome. CONCLUSIONS: We find an increased prevalence of ADHD in girls with TS but no evidence for imprinting effects for cognitive performance.

TI	Epigenetic malprogramming of the insulin receptor promoter due to developmental overfeeding.
PG	393-400
AB	AIM: Prenatal and neonatal overfeeding programs a permanent obesity and diabetes disposition, e.g., due to induction of hypothalamic insulin resistance. We investigated acquired alterations of the DNA methylation pattern of the hypothalamic insulin receptor promoter (IRP) which might be an underlying molecular mechanism. METHODS: Neonatal overfeeding was induced by rearing Wistar rats in small litters (SL). Methylation of CpG-dinucleotides of the hypothalamic IRP was mapped using bisulfite sequencing. RESULTS: Neonatal overfeeding led to rapid early weight gain, resulting in a metabolic syndrome phenotype, i.e., obesity, hyperleptinemia, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and increased insulin/glucose-ratio. The proportion of animals carrying any methylated CpG residue in the 322 bp CpG island of the IRP was increased in neonatally overfed SL rats (n=8), as compared to controls (n=8; P=0.04). Moreover, the mean percentage of methylated CpG positions was also higher in SL rats (P=0.01). Over both groups, neonatal blood glucose levels were positively correlated to the extent of promoter methylation (r=0.52; P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: This study characterizes for the first time the IRP epigenomically in any species and tissue. Our data reveal that the IRP is vulnerable to hypermethylation due to overnutrition, probably especially glucose-dependent in a dose-response manner. This paradigmatically indicates the impact of nutrient-dependent epigenetic malprogramming, leading to a &quot;diabesity&quot; disposition which may become pathogenic throughout life.

TI	Prader Willi and Angelman syndromes: exemplars of genomic imprinting.
PG	76-89
AB	The molecular phenomenon genomic imprinting provides an explanation for why two clinically distinct syndromes share genetic etiologies. Increased understanding of genomic imprinting is affecting diagnostics. Use of improved diagnostic tests can enable early, syndrome-specific, and anticipatory interventions and consequently, improved quality of life; however, these tests are of little use unless clinicians are able to identify at-risk patients. Nurses knowledgeable about Prader Willi and Angelman syndromes and their associated genetic mechanisms can play a significant role in early identification, referral, and intervention of patients with these conditions.

TI	Neonatal sinovenous thrombosis associated with homozygous thermolabile methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase in both mother and infant.
PG	175-8
AB	The C677T mutation in 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) predicts substitution of valine for alanine at residue 223 (A223V). This thermolabile form of MTHFR has 50% reduced activity, has been associated with hyperhomocystinemia, and is a described risk factor for thrombosis in adults.(1-3) In addition, it has been associated with birth defects in the infants of affected mothers and with recurrent fetal losses.(4-6) We report the occurrence of sinovenous thrombosis in a newborn infant who presented with seizures. Both infant and mother were subsequently identified as having homozygous C677T alleles for MTHFR.

TI	Gestational high fat diet programs hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene expression and histone modification in neonatal offspring rats.
PG	2707-17
AB	In insulin resistance and type II diabetes, there is an elevation of hepatic gluconeogenesis, which contributes to hyperglycaemia. Studies in experimental animals have provided evidence that consumption of high fat (HF) diets by female rats programs the progeny for glucose intolerance in adulthood, but the mechanisms behind the in utero programming remain poorly understood. The present study analysed the effect of a maternal HF diet on fetal gluconeogenic gene expression and potential regulation mechanism related to histone modifications. Dams were fed either a Control (C, 16% kcal fat) or a high-fat (HF, 45% kcal fat) diet throughout gestation. Livers of the offspring were collected on gestational day 21 and analysed to determine the consequences of a maternal HF diet on molecular markers of fetal liver gluconeogenesis. We demonstrated that offspring of HF-fed dams were significantly heavier and had significantly higher blood glucose levels at the time of delivery than offspring of dams fed the C diet. While maternal gluconeogenesis and plasma glucose were not affected by the HF diet, offspring of HF-fed dams had significantly higher mRNA contents of gluconeogenic genes in addition to the elevated plasma glucose. In addition to increased transcription rate, a gestational HF diet resulted in modifications of the Pck1 histone code in livers of offspring. Our results demonstrate that in utero exposure to HF diet has the potential to program the gluconeogenic capacity of offspring through epigenetic modifications, which could potentially lead to excessive glucose production and altered insulin sensitivity in adulthood.

TI	Developmental processes and the induction of cardiovascular function: conceptual aspects.
PG	27-34
AB	The epidemiological basis of the developmental origins of disease concept is now widely accepted. The current impetus in research concerns establishing the underlying mechanisms. We discuss the wider biological nature of the phenomenon, with particular reference to 'maternal effects', the processes observed in many species by which the mother can induce phenotypic effects in her offspring. Animal models permit investigation of the induction of cardiovascular phenotypic attributes which resemble pathological effects in humans. We discuss the importance of transitions in aspects of the pre	versus the postnatal environment, with emphasis on nutrition and energy expenditure, and the critical role which the timing of environmental cues plays in inducing effects on the offspring. Coupled with the effects of specific maternal dietary components, the effects on the offspring are argued to involve epigenetic mechanisms. In this review we provide a conceptual framework for synthesising experimental and clinical data, important for considering the impact of the developmental origins concept in a life-course approach to the prevention of cardiovascular disease.

TI	Role of leptin during perinatal metabolic programming and obesity.
PG	55-63
AB	The incidence of obesity is rapidly increasing all over the world in epidemic proportions.The epidemia now affects young children and accumulative evidences suggest that the origin of the disease may occur during foetal development and early life. This has introduced the concept of &quot;developmental programming&quot; supported by experimental studies in animal models and numerous epidemiological data. This concept supports the idea that nutritional and hormonal status during pregnancy and early life could interfere irreversibly on the development of the organs involved in the control of food intake and metabolism and particularly the hypothalamic structures responsible of the establishment of the ingestive behaviour and regulation of energy expenditure. The mechanisms responsible of this developmental programming remain poorly documented. However, recent research indicate that the adipokine leptin plays a critical role in this programming.

TI	Apolipoprotein E gene polymorphism and total serum cholesterol level in Iranian population.
PG	173-5
AB	BACKGROUND: Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is known as a major regulator of blood lipid levels in humans. A number of APOE gene allelic variants have been reported including E2, E3 and E4. Recent studies suggested a role for APOE in obesity and increased Body Mass Index (BMI) and plasma lipid levels in obese children. AIM: The aim of this study was to examine the association between APOE genetic variants and the BMI and lipid profile in an Iranian cohort. SETTING AND DESIGN: Samples were obtained from subjects who participated in a study based on the WHO-designed MONICA (multinational monitoring of trends and determinants in cardiovascular disease) study for coronary artery disease risk assessment in Zone 17 of Tehran. The study was approved by the local ethical committee. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects included in this study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subjects (n=320) were recruited. The level of triglyceride (TG) and total serum cholesterol was tested for all subjects in this study. Genotyping for APOE was carried using polymerase chain reaction-Restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP)technique. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Levels of significance were determined using contingency tables by either Chi-square or Fisher exact analysis using the STATA (v8) software. The analysis of regression and significance of differences for level of cholesterol and TG was established by one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett post hoc multiple comparison tests using SPSS software Version 11.5. RESULTS: The frequency of allele E2 was significantly higher in patients with total serum cholesterol level &lt;200 mg/dl (P 0.01 OR 2.1 95% CI 1.1-4.2). CONCLUSION: The association found in this study between allele E2 and lower total cholesterol level had been reported in previous studies. We have also observed that the frequency of genotype E2/E3 and E2/E4 was significantly higher in patients with normal total serum cholesterol level compared to patients with abnormal cholesterol (P=0.003 OR 2.4 95% CI; 1.3-4.6). Our data needs to be repeated in a larger population with more information for serum LDL and HDL levels and their subgroups.

TI	Genomic organization and mutational analysis of the human UCP2 gene, a prime candidate gene for human obesity.
PG	229-44
AB	Uncoupling proteins (UCPs) are mitochondrial membrane transporters which are involved in dissipating the proton electrochemical gradient thereby releasing stored energy as heat. This implies a major role of UCPs in energy metabolism and thermogenesis which when deregulated are key risk factors for the development of obesity and other eating disorders. Recent studies have shown that the sympathetic nervous system, via norepinephrine (beta-adrenoceptors) and cAMP, as well as thyroid hormones and PPAR gamma ligands seem to be major regulators of UCP expression. From the three different UCPs identified so far by gene cloning UCP1 is expressed exclusively in brown adipocytes while UCP2 is widely expressed. The third analogue, UCP3, is expressed predominantly in human skeletal muscle and was found to exist in a long and a short form. At the amino acid level UCP2 has about 59% homology to UCP1 while UCP3 is 73% identical to UCP2. Both UCP2 and UCP3 were mapped in close proximity (75-150 kb) to regions of human chromosome 11 (11q13) that have been linked to obesity and hyper-insulinaemia. Furthermore, there is strong evidence that UCP2, by virtue of its ubiquitous expression, may be important for determining basal metabolic rate. Based on the published full-length cDNA sequence we have deduced the genomic structure of the human UCP2 (hUCP2) gene by PCR and direct sequence analysis. The hUCP2 gene spans over 8.4 kb distributed on 8 exons. The localization of the exon/intron boundaries within the coding region matches precisely the one found in the human UCP1 gene and is almost conserved in the recently discovered UCP3 gene as well. However, the size of each of the introns in the hUCP2 gene differs from its UCP1 and UCP3 counterparts. It varies from 81 bp (intron 5) to about 3 kb (intron 2). The high degree of homology at the nucleotide level and the conservation of the exon/intron boundaries among the three UCP genes suggests that they may have evolved from a common ancestor or are the result from gene duplication events. Mutational analysis of the hUCP2 gene in a cohort of 25 children of caucasian origin (aged 7-13) characterized by low BMR values revealed a point mutation in exon 4 (C to T transition at position 164 of the corresponding cDNA resulting in the substitution of an alanine residue by a valine at codon 55) and an insertion polymorphism in exon 8. The insertion polymorphism consists of a 45 bp repeat located 150 bp downstream of the stop codon in the 3'-UTR. The allele frequencies were 0.61 and 0.39 for the alanine and valine encoded alleles, respectively, and 0.71 versus 0.29 for the insertion polymorphism. Expression studies of the wildtype and mutant forms of UCP2 should clarify the functional consequences these mutations may have on energy metabolism and body weight regulation. In addition, mapping of the promoter region and the identification of putative promoter regulatory sequences should give insight into the transcriptional regulation of UCP2 expression--in particular by anyone of the above mentioned factors--in vitro and in vivo.

TI	Association of ACE I/D polymorphism in Tunisian patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.
PG	187-91
AB	Primary cardiomyopathies are multifactorial diseases. Genetic factors other than the causal mutations in the modified genes affect the phenotypic expression of dilated cardiomyopathy. The aim of this study was to determine the association of angiotensin-converting enzyme I/D polymorphism with the risk of dilated cardiomyopathy in a Tunisian population. A total of 76 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy was compared to 151 ethnically, age	and gender-matched controls. The frequencies of the DD genotype and D allele were significantly higher in patients as compared with controls, and were associated with increased risk of dilated cardiomyopathy (ACE DD versus ID and II: OR = 3.05 (95% CI, 1.58-5.87; p = 0.001)); D versus I: OR = 2 (95% CI: 1.35-2.97; p = 0.001)). No association was found between the combined genotypes (DD+ID) or D allele and left ventricular end diastolic diameter in dilated cardiomyopathy patients with severe and moderate clinical phenotypes. DD genotype and D allele of angiotensin-converting enzyme I/D gene polymorphism are associated with increased risk of dilated cardiomyopathy in a Tunisian population but do not influence the cardiac phenotype severity.

TI	Cardiac aldosterone in subjects with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
PG	225-30
AB	Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy in subjects with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is variable, suggesting a role for modifying factors. Here, we determined whether aldosterone modulates hypertrophy in HCM. Cardiac and/or plasma aldosterone were measured in organ donors and HCM patients. The effect of the aldosterone synthase ( CYP11B2 ) C-344T polymorphism on LV mass index (LVMI) and interventricular septum thickness (IVS) was determined in 79 genetically independent subjects with HCM. Aldosterone in HCM hearts and plasma was similar to that in normal hearts and plasma. In HCM women, no associations between CYP11B2 genotype and any of the measured parameters were observed, whereas in HCM men, LVMI increased with the presence of the T allele. Similar T allele-related increases were observed for IVS. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the T allele-related effect on IVS occurred independently of renin, the ACE I/D polymorphism, the AT1-receptor A/C(1166)polymorphism and the AT2-receptor A/C(3123) polymorphism. In conclusion, circulating and cardiac aldosterone are normal in HCM, thereby arguing against selectively increased cardiac aldosterone production in HCM. Thus, the association between the CYP11B2 C-344T polymorphism and hypertrophy in HCM most likely relates to the T allele-related increases in circulating aldosterone. This finding raises the need for studies determining the benefit of aldosterone blockade in HCM.

TI	Role of polymorphisms in Adamantiades-Behcet's disease.
PG	2376-8
AB	OBJECTIVE: We previously showed that Adamantiades-Behcet's disease (A-BD) is associated with a lower incidence of malignancy compared with the general population. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) has been shown to play a role in cartilage regeneration and is increased in patients with A-BD. We also found 2 functional polymorphisms of the TGF-beta pathway, TGFBR1*6A and TGFB1*CC, that are associated with risk of malignancy. We tested whether incidence of these polymorphisms would differ in patients with A-BD compared with healthy controls of similar age and geographic location. METHODS: We performed a case-control study including 139 cases and 128 controls from Greece. Cases and controls were genotyped for TGFBR1*6A and TGFB1*CC. RESULTS: We found that cases had lower incidence of TGFBR1*6A compared with controls (11.3% vs 13.3%, respectively). Also, the incidence of TGFB1*CC was lower in cases than controls (24.6% vs 27.0%, respectively). These differences were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Although there is a suggestion that the lower incidence of TGFBR1*6A in A-BD patients may play a protective role against development of malignancy, larger studies would be needed to fully evaluate the role of TGF-beta and its polymorphisms in A-BD.

TI	Association between functional haplotypes of vascular endothelial growth factor and renal complications in Henoch-Schonlein purpura.
PG	69-73
AB	OBJECTIVE: High expression of circulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been reported in patients with Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP). We investigated the role of -1154 G--&gt;A (rs1570360) and -634 G--&gt;C (rs2010963) VEGF gene functional variants in the susceptibility to HSP, to identify associations with severe systemic complications of HSP, in particular with renal complications. METHODS: Fifty-seven patients from the Lugo region of Northwest Spain with primary cutaneous vasculitis classified as HSP according to proposed criteria were studied. All patients were required to have had at least 2 years' followup. Patients and ethnically matched controls (n = 226) were genotyped for the VEGF -1154 G--&gt;A and -634 G--&gt;C polymorphisms using real-time PCR technology based on TaqMan 5' allelic discrimination assay. RESULTS: No significant differences in the allele or genotype frequencies for the 2 VEGF polymorphisms were observed between HSP patients and controls. However, the high VEGF producer VEGF -1154 G allele was increased in HSP patients with nephritis compared with healthy controls (p = 0.02, OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.11-4.08; pc = 0.04). Similarly, the high VEGF producer VEGF -634 C allele was increased in patients with nephritis compared to controls (p = 0.04, OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.01-2.73; pc = 0.08). The -1154G/-634C haplotype was associated with susceptibility to nephritis (p = 0.03, OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.01-2.89). A protective effect against nephritis was observed for the -1154A/-634G VEGF promoter haplotype (p = 0.02, OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.30-0.95). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest a potential implication of the VEGF -1154 G--&gt;A and -634 G--&gt;C polymorphisms in the development of nephritis in patients with HSP.

TI	Polymorphism at codon 469 of the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 locus is associated with protection against severe gastrointestinal complications in Henoch-Schonlein purpura.
PG	1014-8
AB	OBJECTIVE: Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is a small sized vasculitis affecting mainly children. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) gene polymorphisms have recently been implicated in the susceptibility to some vasculitides. To further investigate the clinical implication of ICAM-1 polymorphisms in HSP, we examined their potential association and influence in the development of severe complications in an unselected series of patients with HSP. METHODS: Fifty-two patients, of which 41 were children, were diagnosed with HSP using classification criteria of Michel, et al at the Hospital Xeral-Calde (Lugo, Spain); 129 ethnically matched controls were included. Patients had at least one year of followup. Patients and controls were genotyped by allelic oligonucleotide techniques for ICAM-I polymorphism at codon 241 and 469. RESULTS: The frequency distribution of the alleles and genotypes for each ICAM-1 polymorphism did not show significant differences between HSP patients and controls. Also, no differences between patients with or without renal manifestations were found. However, the frequency of the codon 469 K/E genotype was significantly decreased in patients without severe gastrointestinal manifestations compared to those with them (22.29 vs 65%, OR 0.1, p = 0.02, after correction for age, sex, and disease duration). None of the 11 adults exhibited the R/G genotype at codon 241 compared with 7 of 41 children (OR 0.0, 95% CI 0.0-2.9, p = 0.14). Patients with the R/G genotype were associated with low incidence of renal manifestations and none developed permanent renal involvement (renal sequelae); however, this finding did not achieve statistical significance. CONCLUSION: ICAM-1 polymorphisms alone are not associated with development of HSP, but patients not carrying the codon 469 K/E genotype are at decreased risk of developing severe gastrointestinal complications. The R/G polymorphism at codon 241 may reduce the risk of renal sequelae in the development of HSP in adulthood.

TI	Apolipoprotein E genotype and neurodevelopmental sequelae of infant cardiac surgery.
PG	1736-45
AB	BACKGROUND: There has been increasing recognition of adverse neurodevelopmental sequelae in some children after repair of congenital heart defects. Even among children with the same cardiac defect, significant interindividual variation exists in developmental outcome. Polymorphisms of apolipoprotein E have been identified as a risk factor for worse neurologic recovery after central nervous system injury. METHODS: A single-institution prospective study of patients &lt;or=6 months of age undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass for repair of congenital heart defects was undertaken to evaluate the association between apolipoprotein E genotype and postoperative neurodevelopmental dysfunction. Developmental outcomes were evaluated at 1 year of age by using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. RESULTS: One-year evaluation was performed in 244 patients. After adjustment for preoperative and postoperative covariates-including gestational age, age at operation, sex, race, socioeconomic status, cardiac defect, and use of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest-the apolipoprotein E epsilon2 allele was associated with a worse neurologic outcome as assessed by the Psychomotor Developmental Index of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (P =.036). Patients with the apolipoprotein E epsilon2 allele had approximately a 7-point decrease in the Psychomotor Developmental Index. CONCLUSIONS: Apolipoprotein E epsilon2 allele carriers had significantly lower Psychomotor Development Index scores at 1 year of age after infant cardiac surgery. The effect was independent of ethnicity, socioeconomic status, cardiac defect, and use of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. An effect of the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele was not detected. Genetic polymorphisms that decrease neuroresiliency and impair neuronal repair after central nervous system injury are important risk factors for neurodevelopmental dysfunction after infant cardiac surgery.

TI	Genetic variation in fibrinogen; its relationship to fibrinogen  levels and the risk of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke.
PG	385-90
AB	BACKGROUND: Confounding by common causes and reverse causation have been proposed as explanations for the association between high fibrinogen levels and cardiovascular disease. Genetic variants can alter fibrinogen characteristics and are not subject to these problems. OBJECTIVES: To determine the fibrinogen plasma levels for genotypic variants in fibrinogen-A alpha (FGA Thr312Ala) and fibrinogen-B beta (FGB	455G/A), and whether these variants are associated with arterial thrombosis. METHODS: Fibrinogen genotypes were determined in a population-based case-control study including women aged 18-50 years; 218 cases with myocardial infarction, 192 cases with ischemic stroke, and 769 healthy controls. Fibrinogen levels were determined in the control population. RESULTS: The FGB	455G/A variant increased plasma fibrinogen levels, whereas the FGA Thr312Ala variant lowered plasma fibrinogen levels, albeit to a modest extent. The risk of ischemic stroke was altered when the homozygote minor allele was compared with the homozygote major allele. The FGA Thr312Ala single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was associated with a decrease in risk [odds ratio (OR) 0.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21-0.87], whereas the FGB	455G/A SNP might have increased the risk (OR 1.76; 95% CI 0.7-4.03). The risk of myocardial infarction was not altered for either SNP (FGA Thr312Ala, OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.40-2.40; FGB	455G/A, OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.40-2.40). CONCLUSIONS: With the genetic variations as markers of plasma fibrinogen levels alterations, thereby ruling out confounding and reverse causation, our results suggest that plasma fibrinogen levels could play a more pronounced role as risk factors for ischemic stroke than for myocardial infarction.

TI	Association between patterns of nucleotide variation across the three fibrinogen genes and plasma fibrinogen levels: the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study.
PG	1279-87
AB	BACKGROUND: Previous genotype-phenotype association studies of fibrinogen have been limited by incomplete knowledge of genomic sequence variation within and between major ethnic groups in FGB, FGA, and FGG. METHODS: We characterized the linkage disequilibrium patterns and haplotype structure across the human fibrinogen gene locus in European	and African-American populations. We analyzed the association between common polymorphisms in the fibrinogen genes and circulating levels of both 'functional' fibrinogen (measured by the Clauss clotting rate method) and total fibrinogen (measured by immunonephelometry) in a large, multi-center, bi-racial cohort of young US adults. RESULTS: A common haplotype tagged by the A minor allele of the well-studied FGB-455 G/A promoter polymorphism (FGB 1437) was confirmed to be strongly associated with increased plasma fibrinogen levels. Two non-coding variants specific to African-American chromosomes, FGA 3845 A and FGG 5729 G, were each associated with lower plasma fibrinogen levels. In European-Americans, a common haplotype tagged by FGA Thr312Ala and several other variant alleles across the fibrinogen gene locus was strongly associated with decreased fibrinogen levels as measured by functional assay, but not by immunoassay. Overall, common polymorphisms within the three fibrinogen genes explain &lt; 2% of the variability in plasma fibrinogen concentration. CONCLUSIONS: In young adults, fibrinogen multi-locus genotypes are associated with plasma fibrinogen levels. The specific single nucleotide polymorphism and haplotype patterns for these associations differ according to population and also according to phenotypic assay. It is likely that a substantial proportion of the heritable component of plasma fibrinogen concentration is due to genetic variation outside the three fibrinogen genes.

TI	Prevalence of thrombotic risk factors among beta-thalassemia patients from Western Iran.
PG	229-33
AB	BACKGROUND: There is evidence for increased risk of thrombosis in patients with beta-thalassemia intermedia and beta-thalassemia major. The present study investigated the prevalence of thromboembolic risk factors of prothrombin G20210A, factor V Leiden G1691A and methylentetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T, as well as the hematological and clinical profiles in beta-thalassemia major and intermedia patients from Western Iran. METHODS: Patients consisted of 158 beta-thalassemia patients, 151 beta-thalassemia major and 7 beta-thalassemia intermedia patients, including 82 males and 76 females aged 13.6 +/	6.3 years. The control group were 180 healthy blood donors and school students, consisting of 103 males and 77 females aged 16.8 +/	2.1. Genotyping was done by PCR-RFLP using Mnl I, Hind III and Hinf I for factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A and MTHFR, respectively. RESULTS: The prevalence of prothrombin G20210A variant in patients and healthy individuals were 1.3 and 3.3%, respectively. Factor V Leiden G1691A was insignificantly higher in beta-thalassemia patients (prevalence 5.7% and allele frequency 3.2%) compared to healthy individuals (2.8%). This mutation was found in eight beta-thalassemia major (5.3%) and one beta-thalassemia intermedia (14.3%) patients. The prevalence of MTHFR C677T polymorphism was slightly higher in patients (50%) compared to healthy individuals (48.3%). Around 71% of beta-thalassemia intermedia and 38.4% of beta-thalassemia major patients had undergone splenectomy. In beta-thalassemia major patients, 5.3% had insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and 6.6% had HCV antibodies. All patients with IDDM were splenectomized and in one of them the prothrombin G20210A variant was found. Two patients, a 7-year-old boy with beta-thalassemia intermedia receiving regularly blood transfusion and a beta-thalassemia major patient (a 22-year-old splenectomized female), were found to be homozygous for MTHFR 677TT and heterozygous for factor V Leiden G1691A. Double heterozygosity for factor V Leiden G1691A and MTHFR C677T and also homozygous factor V Leiden 1691AA were found in two beta-thalassemia major patients. No thromboembolic event has been recorded in the files of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The results of present study establish the prevalence of biological risk factors of thrombosis in beta-thalassemia patients from Western Iran. It seems that thrombophilic mutations may not be associated with thrombotic events in thalassemic patients, which needs to be confirmed by the study of larger sample sizes.

TI	A comprehensive analysis of 12 thrombophilic mutations and related parameters in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: data from Turkey.
PG	205-12
AB	BACKGROUND: Possible association of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with the most common inherited prothrombotic conditions has been the focus of many investigations. Advance in modern molecular biology is expanding the thrombophilia evaluation steadily. We tried to put forward a comprehensive thrombophilic profile in IBD and to see the probable role of this profile in pathogenesis. METHODS: A total of 60 adults (33 patients and 27 healthy controls) were included. We used the CVD-StripAssay which is based on the reverse-hybridization principle to identify a total of 12 thrombophilic gene mutations: Factor V R506Q, Factor V H1299R, prothrombin G20210A, Factor XIII V34L, beta-Fibrinogen-455 G-A, PAI-1 4G/5G, platelet GPIIIa L33P, MTHFR C677T, MTHFR A1298C, ACE I/D, Apo B R3500Q and Apo E2/E3/E4, respectively. Besides, we evaluated many related blood parameters such as protein C, protein S, AT-III, IL-6, TNF-alpha, Apo-A1, Apo-B100, homocysteine (tHcy) etc. using commercially available assays. RESULTS: The frequencies of genetic polymorphisms were found to be statistically insignificant among patients and controls, except for three: Beta-Fibrinogen-455G-A, MTHFR A1298C and ACE-I/D. Two patients with a history of deep venous thrombosis had more than one polymorphism. Patients with MTHFR C677T and MTHFR A1298C gene mutations had a similar mean tHcy levels with controls. Patients with Apolipoprotein B R3500Q and Apolipoprotein E4 gene mutations had similar mean LDL-cholesterol levels. Mean total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were similar in patients and controls of Apo E2, E3, E4 alleles. CONCLUSION: Predominantly, the presence of genetic mutations that predispose to hypercoagulable states does not appear to be in correlation with IBD. There was a statistical difference between the proportions of the mutated allele frequencies of Beta-Fibrinogen-455G-A, MTHFR A1298C and ACE-I/D in IBD.

TI	Study on the relationship between cytogenetics and phenotypic effect in Turner's syndrome.
PG	245-8
AB	The cytogenetics and clinical stigmata in 5 cases of Turner's syndrome were studied. Three of them were non-mosaic 1(Xq) and two with partial monosome of a X chromosome short are (Xp21), whose DNA replication patterns of inactive X chromosome were analyzed by RBG technique. Results showed that differences between the replication patterns in cases of X chromosome deletion (Xp21) and normal females existed; that the behavior of abnormal X expressed nonrandom inactivation. It was suggested that the phenotype may be closely related with both X chromosome replication pattern and its inactivation behavior, which might be useful in genetic counselling.

TI	Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus due to a C96Y heterozygous mutation in the insulin gene. A case report.
PG	715-8
AB	CONTEXT: Neonatal diabetes is a rare disorder with an incidence of 1 in 215,000-500,000 live births with 50% of them having permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus. CASE REPORT: We present a case of permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus due to a C96Y (c.287G&gt;A; p.Cys96Tyr) heterozygous mutation in the insulin (INS) gene. Both the patient and his father (who had childhood-onset insulin-requiring diabetes) were found to be carriers of a heterozygous missense mutation C96Y in exon 3 of the INS gene. It has been hypothesized that these mutations disrupt the folding of the proinsulin molecule and result in a misfolded protein or retention of the protein in the endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in endoplasmic reticulum stress and beta cell apoptosis. Subjects with this form of diabetes will need lifelong insulin therapy. CONCLUSION: Insulin gene mutations appear to be an important cause of neonatal diabetes worldwide. This is the first report of a case from the Indian subcontinent. It is important to carry out genetic tests for mutations linked to pancreatic beta cell dysfunction in all patients with persistent neonatal diabetes mellitus in order to decide on therapy.

TI	Functional variation in VEGF is not associated with type 2 diabetes in a United Kingdom Caucasian population.
PG	295-302
AB	CONTEXT: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is important for pancreatic beta cell development and function. Common variation in the VEGF gene is associated with altered serum concentrations of VEGF and with several diseases, but its role in type 2 diabetes is not known. The single nucleotide polymorphisms C-2578A (rs699947), G-1154A (rs1570360) and G-634C (rs2010963) in the 5'-region of VEGF are associated with altered serum concentrations of the protein. OBJECTIVE: We performed a large case-control and family-based study to test the hypothesis that these variants are associated with type 2 diabetes in a UK Caucasian population. PARTICIPANTS: We genotyped 1,969 cases, 1,625 controls and 530 families for the three single nucleotide polymorphisms. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Allele and genotype frequencies were compared between cases and controls. Family-based analysis was used to test for over	or under-transmission of alleles to affected offspring. RESULTS: Despite good power (80%) to detect odds ratios of approximately 1.2, there were no significant associations between single alleles or genotypes and type 2 diabetes. Odds ratios (and 95% confidence intervals) comparing case and control allele frequencies for single nucleotide polymorphisms C-2578A, G-1154A and G-634C were 0.97 (0.88-1.07), 0.99 (0.90-1.09) and 0.97 (0.88-1.08), respectively. CONCLUSION: This is the first large-scale study to examine the association between common functional variation in VEGF and type 2 diabetes risk. We have found no evidence that these three single nucleotide polymorphisms, shown previously to alter VEGF concentrations, are risk factors for type 2 diabetes in a large UK Caucasian case-control and family-based study.

TI	Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Insertion-deletion polymorphism of angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin II receptor.
PG	440-9; 449-50
AB	BACKGROUND: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic-based disease. Several gene mutations leading to HCM development have been described. AIM: Detailed examination of phenotype and genotype of a family with HCM. METHODS: Clinical and genetic examinations were performed in a family with HCM, in which 3 sick persons with different disease phenotype were found. RESULTS: In all sick persons the same molecular substitution G-&gt;A (AGG-&gt;AAG) was noticed. It led to substitution Arg780-Lys in exon 21 beta-myosin heavy chain gene, which was responsible for the development of the disease. Insertion	deletion polymorphism analysis in ACE gene revealed D/D (deletion/deletion) genotype in proband and D/I (deletion/ insertion) phenotype in his mother and sister, who were heterozygous. Polymorphism A1166C analysis in AT1 gene revealed the presence of genotype A/A in proband and A/C in his mother and sister. In proband and his sister a very similar phenotype was observed, whereas they had different polymorphism for ACE gene and angiotensin 1 receptor gene. In sick proband's mother, who had phenotype different to her children, the same polymorphism as in his daughter was noticed. CONCLUSIONS: In the described family with HCM, different phenotype and polymorphism of ACE and AT1 genes were found.

TI	Risk of advanced diabetic nephropathy in type 1 diabetes is associated with endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene polymorphism.
PG	405-13
AB	Risk of advanced diabetic nephropathy in type 1 diabetes is associated with endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene polymorphism. BACKGROUND: Polymorphisms in the endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene (eNOS) may be implicated in the development of nephropathy in patients with type 1 or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). METHODS: Three groups of IDDM patients were selected to study this hypothesis: cases with advanced diabetic nephropathy (N = 78), cases with overt proteinuria but normal serum creatinine (N = 74), and controls with normoalbuminuria despite 15 years of diabetes (N = 195). Parents of 132 cases and 53 controls were also examined and were used for the transmission disequilibrium test, a family-based study design to test association. RESULTS: We examined four eNOS polymorphisms, and two were associated with diabetic nephropathy in the case-control comparisons: a T to C substitution in the promoter at position -786 and the a-deletion/b-insertion in intron 4. For the former, the risk of developing advanced nephropathy was higher for C allele homozygotes than for the other two genotypes (odds ratio 2.8, 95% CI, 1.4 to 5.6). For the latter polymorphism, it was the a-deletion carriers that had the higher risk (odds ratio 2.3, 95% CI, 1.3 to 4.0) in comparison with noncarriers. Both polymorphisms were analyzed together as haplotypes in a family-based study using the transmission disequilibrium test. The C/a-deletion haplotype was transmitted from heterozygous parents to cases with advanced diabetic nephropathy with a significantly higher frequency than expected (P = 0.004). CONCLUSION: The findings of the case-control and family-based studies demonstrate clearly that DNA sequence differences in eNOS influence the risk of advanced nephropathy in type 1 diabetes.

TI	Angiotensin I-converting enzyme gene insertion/deletion and angiotensinogen M235T polymorphisms: risk of chronic renal failure. End-Stage Renal Disease Study Group.
PG	513-9
AB	BACKGROUND: Chronic renal failure (CRF) is a complex phenotype that results from an underlying kidney disease and superimposing environmental and genetic factors. The aim of our study was to evaluate the role of polymorphisms in the genes encoding for components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the development and/or progression of CRF. METHODS: Two hundred forty-seven family trios (patients with CRF and both parents; 120 with primary chronic glomerulonephritis, 80 with interstitial nephritis, and 47 with type 1 diabetes with nephropathy) were examined, and transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT) was used to evaluate allele transmission from heterozygous parents to affected offspring. RESULTS: The D allele of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) gene insertion/deletion polymorphism was transmitted significantly more frequently than expected for no association among all examined trios and in the subgroup of patients with interstitial nephritis. The angiotensinogen 235T allele was transmitted significantly more frequently to patients with CRF than expected for no association, but the effect was seen only in patients with interstitial nephritis. The presence of the DD or ID genotype was associated with a faster rate of decline of renal function, which was not observed for the angiotensinogen M235T polymorphism. For chymase gene and angiotensin II receptor type 1 gene, allele transmission did not deviate significantly from a random proportion of 50:50%. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that ACE gene insertion/deletion and angiotensinogen M235T polymorphisms contribute to the increased risk for the development of CRF, but the magnitude of the effect within subsets of patients with specific etiologies of CRF must be evaluated further.

TI	Beta-2 adrenoceptor genetic variation is associated with genetic predisposition to essential hypertension: The Bergen Blood Pressure Study.
PG	1455-60
AB	We tested the hypothesis that genetic variation in the beta-2 adrenoceptor gene is associated with a genetic predisposition to hypertension. Offspring of two hypertensive parents were compared with offspring of two normotensive parents. The subjects were participants of the Bergen Blood Pressure Study, where couples were recruited in 1963 to 1964 and re-examined in 1990. We studied offspring of those couples in which both partners were either hypertensive or normotensive in both examinations. Twenty-three hypertensive and 22 normotensive families met the inclusion criteria. DNA samples from the first born of hypertensive family-history offspring and normotensive family-history offspring were analyzed. We used multiplex sequencing and specifically examined the promoter and the N-terminal portion of the beta-2 adrenoceptor gene. We found four genetic variants: at position -47, a C--&gt;T substitution in the 5' leader cistron causing an Arg--&gt;Cys exchange, at -20, a T--&gt;C substitution, at +46 an A--&gt;G substitution leading to an Arg16--&gt;Gly exchange, and at +79, a C--&gt;G substitution leading to a Gln27--&gt;Glu exchange. The frequency of the Arg16 allele was significantly higher in the hypertensive family-history offspring compared to normotensive family-history offspring (58% vs. 28% P &lt; 0.011). We constructed haplotypes for the four intragenic variants and found significant linkage dysequilibrium. In particular, the 5' leader cistron mutant with the wild type alleles at the other loci was significantly more frequent in offspring of hypertensive parents, compared to offspring of normotensive parents. We also performed a relative risk analysis comparing the Gly/Gly, Arg/Gly, and Arg/Arg alleles, which implicated the Arg-containing allele. Finally, we analyzed the effect of genotype on blood pressure in the offspring. We found a significant step-wise effect for all four polymorphisms examined. Our data suggest that the Arg variant of the Arg--&gt;Gly exchange is associated with parental hypertension and higher blood pressure values in this northern European population.

TI	The effect of parental imprinting on the INS-IGF2 locus of Korean type I diabetic patients.
PG	223-9
AB	BACKGROUND: Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is caused by the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta-cells. Susceptibility to IDDM appears to depend on more than one genetic locus. Evidence of a genetic linkage for IDDM2 was found in male meioses from French and North American populations. It is linked to maternal imprinting (i.e. monoalleleic expression of the insulin gene) that is considered the most likely cause of these gender-related differences. IGF2 is expressed only in the paternal allele and, therefore, is considered a candidate gene for IDDM2 transmission because of its important autocrine/paracrine effects on the thymus, lymphocytes and pancreas. Nevertheless, it remains controversial whether the parental origin of IDDM2 influences IDDM susceptibility. METHODS: Using PCR and semi-quantitative RT-PCR, we analyzed the INS/Pstl + 1127 and IGF2/Apal polymorphisms and RNA expression level between Pstl (+/-) and Pstl (+/+) to determine genotype and allele-specific expression of the INS and IGF2 genes. RESULTS: INS/Pstl (+/+) and IGF2/Apal (+/-) were observed in 36 (97.3%) of 37 IDDM patients and in 29 (72.5%) of 40 IDDM patients, respectively. The presence of both IGF2 alleles in RNA was observed in 21 (91.6%) of 24 IDDM patients. Our results show a 3-fold increase in RNA expression from Pstl (+/-) allele over Pstl (+/+) allele. CONCLUSION: Our conclusion does not entirely exclude IGF2 as the gene involved in IDDM2, even though the parental effect of IDDM2 transmission is not related to IGF2 maternal imprinting. The INS genotype appeared mostly in the Pstl (+/+) homozygote and, therefore, we could not explain the INS imprinting pattern in Korean type 1 diabetic patients. Genetic differences between populations may account for the discrepancy between Korean type I diabetic patients and American or French type I diabetic patients.

TI	Lack of hepatocellular CD10 along bile canaliculi is physiologic in early childhood and persistent in Alagille syndrome.
PG	1138-48
AB	Many tissues, including hepatobiliary cells, express neutral endopeptidase (CD10), encoded by MME. Serum neutral endopeptidase activity (NEA) has been recommended as a marker of cholestasis in adults but not in children with Alagille syndrome (AGS). We investigated ontogenic and disease-related differences in the expression of CD10. CD10 was found on canalicular surfaces of hepatocytes throughout the lobule in 16 adults and in 31 children aged &gt; or =24 months, with and without cholestasis, but not in 39 children aged &lt;24 months, with and without cholestasis. Ten AGS children aged 2 months to 6 years lacked any canalicular CD10 expression. Cholangiocyte apices and/or intrasinusoidal granulocytes marked for CD10 in all subjects. Liver membrane fractions from a child with cholestasis aged &lt;24 months and from 2 AGS patients aged &gt;24 months contained reduced levels of CD10. In contrast, AGS children and all controls expressed CD10 similarly on granulocytes. MME mRNA was found in the liver of children aged &lt;24 months and of adults, all with cholestasis, and of AGS patients. Granulocyte MME mRNA levels were similar among all study subjects; however, liver MME mRNA levels were 6	to 140-fold less than in normal adults in all cholestatic subjects, including AGS children. Methylation of the MME promoter was not detected in the liver of AGS children. In conclusion, hepatocytes in early childhood physiologically lack immunohistochemically detectable CD10. Reduced MME mRNA in AGS is not due to MME promoter methylation. Liver CD10 in childhood appears to undergo reduced synthesis or rapid degradation, which persists in AGS. Absence of CD10 expression thus may limit NEA as a marker of cholestasis in young patients and in AGS.

TI	Large-scale test of hypothesised associations between the angiotensin-converting-enzyme insertion/deletion polymorphism and myocardial infarction in about 5000 cases and 6000 controls. International Studies of Infarct Survival (ISIS) Collaborators.
PG	434-42
AB	BACKGROUND: The original report of a possible association between myocardial infarction and the insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the gene for the angiotensin-1-converting enzyme (ACE) indicated a risk ratio for myocardial infarction with the DD genotype of 1.34 (95% CI 1.05-1.70), and the association was claimed to be particularly strong in a retrospectively defined low-risk subgroup (3.2 [95% CI 1.7-5.9). Subsequent investigations reached varying conclusions, but all were small, and much larger studies were needed. METHODS: 4629 myocardial infarction cases and 5934 controls were compared. Cases were UK men aged 30-54 years and women aged 30-64 years recruited on presentation to hospital with confirmed myocardial infarction. Controls were aged 30-64 years with no history of cardiovascular disease, but were siblings or children of myocardial infarction survivors, or spouses of such relatives. All risk-ratio calculations allow for this relatedness of some of the controls. An updated meta-analysis of previous studies was also conducted. FINDINGS: The ACE DD genotype was found in 1359 (29.4%) of the myocardial infarction cases and in 1637 (27.6%) of the controls (risk ratio 1.10 [95% CI 1.00-1.21]). The association between myocardial infarction and the DD genotype did not seem to be stronger in the subgroup defined as low risk by previously used criteria (234 [28%] of 836 cases and 911 [28%] of 3253 controls: risk ratio 1.04 [95% CI 0.87-1.24]), or in any other subgroup. Nor was the ACE I/D genotype predictive of subsequent survival. INTERPRETATION: This study involved many more cases than any previously reported study of this question, but did not confirm the existence of any substantial association. In an updated meta-analysis of these results with those of previously published studies, the risk ratio for myocardial infarction with the DD genotype seems to lie in the range 1.0 to about 1.1. Although an increase in risk of up to about 10-15% cannot be ruled out, substantially more extreme risks can be. Moreover, there are not especially strong associations in the subgroups previously selected for emphasis. These findings illustrate the need for some studies of candidate genes to involve much larger populations than is customary, without undue emphasis on retrospectively defined subgroups.

TI	A life-course approach to the aetiology of late-onset dementias.
PG	87-96
AB	Substantial progress has been made in the understanding of the neurobiology of dementias, but comprehensive causal models are not available. Genetic and environmental factors probably interact to determine vulnerability to the dementias. The life-course approach to age-related diseases, when systematically applied to the dementias, provides opportunities to identify the nature and timing of environmental contributions. We discuss the relevance of the fetal origins of adult disease hypothesis to the dementias. Associations between the dementias (most often described as Alzheimer's disease) and ischaemic heart disease, obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus are set against associations between dementias and childhood intelligence, low educational attainments, low socioeconomic status, occupation, and lifetime dietary history. Biological mechanisms that explain how fetal development might influence the risk of adult disease may be relevant to many age-related diseases including the dementias and, possibly, to the biology of ageing.

TI	Additional heterozygous 2507A&gt;C mutation of WFS1 in progressive hearing loss at lower frequencies.
PG	166-71
AB	OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To describe the audiological profiles in a Japanese family with autosomal dominant hereditary sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and to identify the causative gene. STUDY DESIGN: A family study at an academic tertiary referral center. METHODS: A family with autosomal dominant hereditary SNHL was enrolled. Hearing loss (HL) of affected members showed mid-frequency SNHL in childhood and progressed at lower frequencies with age, resulting in low-frequency SNHL. To understand the pathology of HL of this family, we performed a genetic analysis of WFS1, TECTA, and GJB2 by direct sequencing, and further audiovestibular examinations, including speech audiometry, distortion product otoacoustic emissions, electrocochleography, auditory brainstem responses, and electronystagmography for some affected members. RESULTS: A heterozygous A-to-C nucleotide transversion (c.2507A&gt;C), resulting in a lysine-to-threonine substitution at codon 836 (K836T) was identified in exon 8 of WFS1. K836T was segregated with HL in the 15 participants in the genetic study but was not detected in the 212 normal chromosomes. Only polymorphic changes were detected in TECTA and GJB2. Audiovestibular examinations indicated purely cochlear HL and normal vestibular function. The summating potential/action potential ratios in electrocochleography increased in the bilateral ears of the proband. CONCLUSIONS: The family described with autosomal dominant inheritance of K836T of the WFS1 gene demonstrates a progressive hearing loss in the lower frequencies.

TI	Maternal inflammation, growth retardation, and preterm birth: insights into adult cardiovascular disease.
PG	417-21
AB	The &quot;fetal origin of adult disease Hypothesis&quot; originally described by Barker et al. identified the relationship between impaired in utero growth and adult cardiovascular disease risk and death. Since then, numerous clinical and experimental studies have confirmed that early developmental influences can lead to cardiovascular, pulmonary, metabolic, and psychological diseases during adulthood with and without alterations in birth weight. This so called &quot;fetal programming&quot; includes developmental disruption, immediate adaptation, or predictive adaptation and can lead to epigenetic changes affecting a specific organ or overall health. The intrauterine environment is dramatically impacted by the overall maternal health. Both premature birth or low birth weight can result from a variety of maternal conditions including undernutrition or dysnutrition, metabolic diseases, chronic maternal stresses induced by infections and inflammation, as well as hypercholesterolemia and smoking. Numerous animal studies have supported the importance of both maternal health and maternal environment on the long term outcomes of the offspring. With increasing rates of obesity and diabetes and survival of preterm infants born at early gestational ages, the need to elucidate mechanisms responsible for programming of adult cardiovascular disease is essential for the treatment of upcoming generations.

TI	Investigation of the role of epigenetic modification of the rat glucokinase gene in fetal programming.
PG	1407-15
AB	Fetal malnutrition is associated with development of impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes and hypertension in later life in humans and several mammalian species. The mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon of fetal programming are unknown. We hypothesize that adverse effects in utero and early life may influence the basal expression levels of certain genes such that they are re-set with long-term consequences for the organism. An excellent candidate mechanism for this re-setting process is DNA methylation, since post-natal methylation patterns are largely established in utero. We have sought to test this hypothesis by investigating the glucokinase gene (Gck) in rat offspring programmed using a maternal low protein diet model (MLP). Northern blot reveals that fasting levels of Gck expression are reduced after programming, although this distinction disappears after feeding. Bisulphite sequencing of the hepatic Gck promoter indicates a complete absence of methylation at the 12 CpG sites studied in controls and MLP animals. Non-expressing cardiac tissue also showed no DNA methylation in this region, whereas brain and all fetal tissues were fully methylated. These findings are not consistent with the hypothesis that programming results from differential methylation of Gck. However, it remains possible that programming may influence methylation patterns in Gck at a distance from the promoter, or in genes encoding factors that regulate basal Gck expression.

TI	Relationship of APOA5, PPARgamma and HL gene variants with serial changes in childhood body mass index and coronary artery disease risk factors in young adulthood.
PG	68
AB	BACKGROUND: Triglycerides is an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD) and is especially important in Indians because of high prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia in this population. Both genetic and environmental factors determine triglyceride levels. In a birth cohort from India, hypertriglyceridemia was found in 41% of men and 11% of women. Subjects who had high triglycerides had more rapid body mass index (BMI) or weight gain than rest of the cohort throughout infancy, childhood and adolescence. We analysed polymorphisms in APOA5, hepatic lipase and PPARgamma genes and investigated their association with birth weight and serial changes in BMI. RESULTS: Polymorphisms in APOA5 (-1131T &gt; C, S19W), PPARgamma (Pro12Ala) and hepatic lipase (-514C &gt; T) were studied by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by restriction digestion in 1492 subjects from the New Delhi Birth Cohort (NDBC). We assessed whether these polymorphisms influence lipid and other variables and serial changes in BMI, both individually and together.The risk allele of APOA5 (-1131C) resulted in 23.6 mg/dl higher triglycerides as compared to normal allele (P &lt; 0.001). Risk allele of HL (-514T) was associated with significantly higher HDL2 levels (P = 0.002). Except for the marginal association of PPARgamma Pro12Ala variation with a lower conditional weight at 6 months, (P = 0.020) and APOA5 S19W with a higher conditional BMI at 11 yrs of age (P = 0.030), none of the other associations between the gene polymorphisms and serial changes in body mass index from birth to young adulthood were significant. CONCLUSION: The promoter polymorphism in APOA5 was associated with raised serum triglycerides and that of HL with raised HDL2 levels. None of the polymorphisms had any significant relationship with birth weight or serial changes in anthropometry from birth to adulthood in this cohort.

TI	Genetic variant of V825I in the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 gene and serum lipid levels in the Guangxi Bai Ku Yao and Han populations.
PG	14
AB	BACKGROUND: Several genetic variants in the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) gene have associated with modifications of serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and the susceptibility for coronary heart disease, but the findings are still controversial in diverse racial/ethnic groups. Bai Ku Yao is an isolated subgroup of the Yao minority in southern China. The present study was undertaken to detect the possible association of V825I (rs2066715) polymorphism in the ABCA1 gene and several environmental factors with serum lipid levels in the Guangxi Bai Ku Yao and Han populations. METHODS: A total of 677 subjects of Bai Ku Yao and 646 participants of Han Chinese were randomly selected from our previous stratified randomized cluster samples. Polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism assay combined with gel electrophoresis were performed for the genotyping of V825I variant, and then confirmed by direct sequencing. RESULTS: The levels of serum total cholesterol (TC), HDL-C, apolipoprotein (Apo) AI and ApoB were lower in Bai Ku Yao than in Han (P &lt; 0.01 for all). The frequency of G and A alleles was 57.4% and 42.6% in Bai Ku Yao, and 57.7% and 42.3% in Han (P &gt; 0.05); respectively. The frequency of GG, GA and AA genotypes was 33.7%, 47.4% and 18.9% in Bai Ku Yao, and 33.4%, 48.6% and 18.0% in Han (P &gt; 0.05); respectively. There was no difference in the genotypic and allelic frequencies between males and females in the both ethnic groups. The subjects with AA genotype in Bai Ku Yao had higher serum TC levels than the subjects with GG and GA genotypes (P &lt; 0.05). The participants with AA genotype in Han had lower serum HDL-C and ApoAI levels than the participants with GG and GA genotypes (P &lt; 0.05 for each), but these results were found in males but not in females. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that the levels of TC in Bai Ku Yao and HDL-C and ApoAI in male Han were correlated with genotypes (P &lt; 0.05 for all). Serum lipid parameters were also correlated with sex, age, body mass index, alcohol consumption, and blood pressure in both ethnic groups (P &lt; 0.05-0.001). CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that the V825I polymorphism in the ABCA1 gene is associated with male serum HDL-C and ApoAI levels in the Han, and serum TC levels in the Bai Ku Yao populations. The difference in the association of V825I polymorphism and serum lipid levels between the two ethnic groups might partly result from different ABCA1 gene-environmental interactions.

TI	The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 gene E670G polymorphism and serum lipid levels in the Guangxi Bai Ku Yao and Han populations.
PG	5
AB	BACKGROUND: Proprotein convertase subtilisin-like kexin type 9 (PCSK9) plays a key role in regulating plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. However, the association of E670G (rs505151) polymorphism in the PCSK9 gene and serum lipid levels is inconsistent in several previous studies. The present study was undertaken to detect the association of PCSK9 E670G polymorphism and several environmental factors with serum lipid levels in the Guangxi Bai Ku Yao and Han populations. METHODS: A total of 649 subjects of Bai Ku Yao and 646 participants of Han were randomly selected from our previous samples. Genotypes of the PCSK9 E670G polymorphism were determined via polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism combined with gel electrophoresis, and then confirmed by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Serum levels of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL-C, and apolipoprotein (Apo) AI were lower in Bai Ku Yao than in Han (P &lt; 0.01 for all). The frequency of G allele was 2.00% in Bai Ku Yao and 4.80% in Han (P &lt; 0.01). There was significant difference in the genotypic and allelic frequencies between Bai Ku Yao and Han (P &lt; 0.01); between normal LDL-C (&lt;/= 3.20 mmol/L) and high LDL-C subgroups (&gt; 3.20 mmol/L, P &lt; 0.01) in Bai Ku Yao; and between normal HDL-C (&gt;/= 0.91 mmol/L) and low HDL-C (&lt; 0.91 mmol/L, P &lt; 0.05), between normal ApoAI (&gt;/= 1.00 g/L) and low ApoAI (&lt; 1.00 g/L, P &lt; 0.05), or between normal ApoAI/ApoB ratio (&gt;/= 1.00) and low ApoAI/ApoB ratio (&lt; 1.00, P &lt; 0.01) subgroups in Han. The G allele carriers in Han had higher serum HDL-C levels and the ratio of ApoAI to ApoB than the G allele noncarriers. The G allele carriers in Han had higher serum HDL-C and ApoAI levels than the G allele noncarriers in males (P &lt; 0.05 for each), whereas the G allele carriers had lower serum ApoB levels and higher the ratio of ApoAI to ApoB than the G allele noncarriers in females (P &lt; 0.05 for all). Serum HDL-C and ApoAI levels in Han were correlated with genotypes (P &lt; 0.05) in males, and serum ApoB levels and the ratio of ApoAI to ApoB were associated with genotypes (P &lt; 0.05) in females. CONCLUSIONS: The PCSK9 E670G polymorphism is mainly associated with some serum lipid parameters in the Han population. The G allele carriers had higher serum HDL-C and ApoAI levels in males, and lower serum ApoB levels and higher the ApoAI/ApoB ratio in females than the G allele noncarriers.

Genotyping of the MTHFR C677T was performed by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism combined with gel electrophoresis, and then confirmed by direct sequencing. RESULTS: The levels of serum total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein (Apo) AI and ApoB were lower in Bai Ku Yao than in Han (P &lt; 0.05-0.001). The frequency of C and T alleles was 77.4% and 22.6% in Bai Ku Yao, and 60.9% and 39.1% in Han (P &lt; 0.001); respectively. The frequency of CC, CT and TT genotypes was 58.7%, 37.3% and 4.0% in Bai Ku Yao, and 32.6%, 56.4% and 11.0% in Han (P &lt; 0.001); respectively. The levels of TC and LDL-C in both ethnic groups were significant differences among the three genotypes (P &lt; 0.05-0.01). The T allele carriers had higher serum TC and LDL-C levels than the T allele noncarriers. The levels of ApoB in Han were significant differences among the three genotypes (P &lt; 0.05). The T allele carriers had higher serum ApoB levels as compared with the T allele noncarriers. The levels of TC, TG and LDL-C in Bai Ku Yao were correlated with genotypes (P &lt; 0.05-0.001), whereas the levels of LDL-C in Han were associated with genotypes (P &lt; 0.001). Serum lipid parameters were also correlated with sex, age, body mass index, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and blood pressure in the both ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: The differences in serum TC, TG, LDL-C and ApoB levels between the two ethnic groups might partly result from different genotypic and allelic frequencies of the MTHFR C677T or different MTHFR gene-enviromental interactions.

TI	Association of LIPC -250G&gt;A polymorphism and several environmental factors with serum lipid levels in the Guangxi Bai Ku Yao and Han populations.
PG	28
AB	BACKGROUND: The association between -250G&gt;A polymorphism in the promoter region of the hepatic lipase gene (LIPC) and plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentration is contradictory in diverse ethnics. Bai Ku Yao is an isolated subgroup of the Yao minority in China. This study was designed to detect the association of LIPC -250G&gt;A (rs2070895) polymorphism and several environmental factors with serum lipid levels in the Guangxi Bai Ku Yao and Han populations. METHODS: A total of 778 subjects of Bai Ku Yao and 648 participants of Han Chinese aged 15-80 were randomly selected from our previous stratified randomized cluster samples. Genotyping of the LIPC -250G&gt;A was performed by polymerse chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism combined with gel electrophoresis, and then confirmed by direct sequencing. RESULTS: The levels of serum total cholesterol (TC), HDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and apolipoprotein (Apo) AI were lower in Bai Ku Yao than in Han (P &lt; 0.01 for all). The frequencies of GG, GA and AA genotypes were 50.0%, 43.3% and 6.7% in Bai Ku Yao, and 35.7%, 50.6% and 13.7% in Han (P &lt; 0.01); respectively. The frequencies of G and A alleles were 71.7% and 28.3% in Bai Ku Yao, and 61.0% and 39.0% in Han (P &lt; 0.01). The levels of HDL-C and the ratio of ApoAI to ApoB in Bai Ku Yao were lower in GG genotype than in GA or AA genotype (P &lt; 0.05-0.01). The levels of TC, HDL-C, LDL-C and ApoB in Han were lower in GG genotype than in GA or AA genotype (P &lt; 0.05-0.01). The levels of HDL-C and the ratio of ApoAI to ApoB in Bai Ku Yao, and the levels of HDL-C, LDL-C and ApoB in Han were correlated with genotype and/or allele (P &lt; 0.05 for all). Serum lipid parameters were also correlated with age, sex, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, blood pressure, body weight, and body mass index in both ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: The differences in the serum lipid profiles between the two ethnic groups might partly result from different genotypic frequency of LIPC -250G&gt;A or different LIPC-enviromental interactions.

TI	Fatty-acid binding protein 4 gene variants and childhood obesity: potential implications for insulin sensitivity and CRP levels.
PG	18
AB	INTRODUCTION: Obesity increases the risk for insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome in both adults and children. FABP4 is a member of the intracellular lipid-binding protein family that is predominantly expressed in adipose tissue, and plays an important role in maintaining glucose and lipid homeostasis. The purpose of this study was to measure FABP4 plasma levels, assess FABP4 allelic variants, and explore potential associations with fasting glucose and insulin levels in young school-age children with and without obesity. METHODS: A total of 309 consecutive children ages 5-7 years were recruited. Children were divided based on BMI z score into Obese (OB; BMI z score &gt;1.65) and non-obese (NOB). Fasting plasma glucose, lipids, insulin, hsCRP, and FABP4 levels were measured. HOMA was used as correlate of insulin sensitivity. Four SNPs of the human FABP4 gene (rs1051231, rs2303519, rs16909233 and rs1054135), corresponding to several critical regions of the encoding FABP4 gene sequence were genotyped. RESULTS: Compared to NOB, circulating FABP4 levels were increased in OB, as were LDL, hsCRP and HOMA. FABP4 levels correlated with BMI, and also contributed to the variance of HOMA and hsCRP, but not serum lipids. The frequency of rs1054135 allelic variant was increased in OB, and was associated with increased FABP4 levels, while the presence of rs16909233 variant allele, although similar in OB and NOB, was associated with increased HOMA values. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood obesity is associated with higher FABP4 levels that may promote cardiometabolic risk. The presence of selective SNPs in the FABP4 gene may account for increased risk for insulin resistance or systemic inflammation in the context of obesity.

TI	Interactions of the apolipoprotein C-III 3238C&gt;G polymorphism and alcohol consumption on serum triglyceride levels.
PG	86
AB	BACKGROUND: Both apolipoprotein (Apo) C-III gene polymorphism and alcohol consumption have been associated with increased serum triglyceride (TG) levels, but their interactions on serum TG levels are not well known. The present study was undertaken to detect the interactions of the ApoC-III 3238C&gt;G (rs5128) polymorphism and alcohol consumption on serum TG levels. METHODS: A total of 516 unrelated nondrinkers and 514 drinkers aged 15-89 were randomly selected from our previous stratified randomized cluster samples. Genotyping of the ApoC-III 3238C&gt;G was performed by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism combined with gel electrophoresis, and then confirmed by direct sequencing. Interactions of the ApoC-III 3238C&gt;G genotype and alcohol consumption was assessed by using a cross-product term between genotypes and the aforementioned factor. RESULTS: Serum total cholesterol (TC), TG, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), ApoA-I and ApoB levels were higher in drinkers than in nondrinkers (P &lt; 0.05-0.001). There was no significant difference in the genotypic and allelic frequencies between the two groups. Serum TG levels in nondrinkers were higher in CG genotype than in CC genotype (P &lt; 0.01). Serum TC, TG, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and ApoB levels in drinkers were higher in GG genotype than in CC or CG genotype (P &lt; 0.01 for all). Serum HDL-C levels in drinkers were higher in CG genotype than in CC genotype (P &lt; 0.01). Serum TC, TG, HDL-C and ApoA-I levels in CC genotype, TC, HDL-C, ApoA-I levels and the ratio of ApoA-I to ApoB in CG genotype, and TC, TG, LDL-C, ApoA-I and ApoB levels in GG genotype were higher in drinkers than in nondrinkers (P &lt; 0.05-0.01). But the ratio of ApoA-I to ApoB in GG genotype was lower in drinkers than in nondrinkers (P &lt; 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the levels of TC, TG and ApoB were correlated with genotype in nondrinkers (P &lt; 0.05 for all). The levels of TC, LDL-C and ApoB were associated with genotype in drinkers (P &lt; 0.01 for all). Serum lipid parameters were also correlated with age, sex, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, blood pressure, body weight, and body mass index in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the ApoC-III 3238CG heterozygotes benefited more from alcohol consumption than CC and GG homozygotes in increasing serum levels of HDL-C, ApoA-I, and the ratio of ApoA-I to ApoB, and lowering serum levels of TC and TG.

TI	Evidence of maternal QTL affecting growth and obesity in adult mice.
PG	269-80
AB	Most quantitative trait loci (QTL) studies fail to account for the effect that the maternal genotype may have on an individual's phenotypes, even though maternal effect QTL have been shown to account for considerable variation in growth and obesity traits in mouse models. Moreover, the fetal programming theory suggests that maternal effects influence an offspring's adult fitness, although the genetic nature of fetal programming remains unclear. Within this context, our study focused on mapping genomic regions associated with maternal effect QTL by analyzing the phenotypes of chromosomes 2 and 7 subcongenic mice from genetically distinct dams. We analyzed 12 chromosome 2 subcongenic strains that spanned from 70 to 180 Mb with CAST/EiJ donor regions on the background of C57BL/6 J, and 14 chromosome 7 subcongenic strains that spanned from 81 to 111 Mb with BALB/cByJ donor regions on C57BL/6ByJ background. Maternal QTL analyses were performed on the basis of overlapping donor regions between subcongenic strains. We identified several highly significant (P &lt; 5 x 10(-4)) maternal QTL influencing total body weight, organ weight, and fat pad weights in both sets of subcongenics. These QTL accounted for 1.9-11.7% of the phenotypic variance for growth and obesity and greatly narrowed the genomic regions associated with the maternal genetic effects. These maternal effect QTL controlled phenotypic traits in adult mice, suggesting that maternal influences at early stages of development may permanently affect offspring performance. Identification of maternal effects in our survey of two sets of subcongenic strains, representing approximately 5% of the mouse genome, supports the hypothesis that maternal effects represent significant sources of genetic variation that are largely ignored in genetic studies.

TI	Beta2-adrenergic receptor gene polymorphisms as systemic determinants of healthy aging in an evolutionary context.
PG	338-45
AB	The Gln(27)Glu polymorphism but not the Arg(16)Gly polymorphism of the beta2-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) gene appears to be associated with a broad range of aging-associated phenotypes, including cancers at different sites, myocardial infarction (MI), intermittent claudication (IC), and overall/healthy longevity in the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort. The Gln(27)Gln genotype increases risks of cancer, MI and IC, whereas the Glu(27) allele or, equivalently, the Gly(16)Glu(27) haplotype tends to be protective against these diseases. Genetic associations with longevity are of opposite nature at young-old and oldest-old ages highlighting the phenomenon of antagonistic pleiotropy. The mechanism of antagonistic pleiotropy is associated with an evolutionary-driven advantage of carriers of a derived Gln(27) allele at younger ages and their survival disadvantage at older ages as a result of increased risks of cancer, MI and IC. The ADRB2 gene can play an important systemic role in healthy aging in evolutionary context that warrants exploration in other populations.

TI	[Association between Fok I vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphism and plasmatic concentrations of transforming growth factor-beta1 and interferon gamma in type 1 diabetes mellitus].
PG	81-4
AB	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In order to assess whether Fok I vitamin D receptor gene (VDR) polymorphism is involved in the genetic susceptibility of type 1 diabetes, a case-control study was conducted and VDR genotypes were related to serum concentrations of 25(OH) vitamin D and cytokines transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) and interferon gamma (INF-gamma). PATIENTS AND METHOD: 151 incident cases of type 1 diabetes and 182 non related healthy controls from Santiago were studied for VDR polymorphisms in peripheral blood DNA. Exon 2 (Fok I) segments were amplified by polimerase chain reaction and analyzed by means of restriction fragment length polymorphism to determine each corresponding genotype. Differences for allele, genotype and serological markers as 25(OH) vitamin D, TGF-beta1 and INF-gamma levels distribution between patients and controls were analyzed. RESULTS: Fok I polymorphism distribution analysis showed no differences between patients and controls. Among diabetics, higher levels of TGF-beta1 (median, 282.6 pg/ml; range, 131.8-3,031.4) were observed compared with healthy children (median, 232.2 pg/ml; range, 135.7-506.5) (p &lt; 0.0038). Similar results were observed for INF-gamma concentrations (median, 121.1 pg/ml, and range, 5.3-228.8, in cases, and median, 89.6 pg/ml, and range, 10.9-117.2 in controls) (p &lt; 0.0004). The diabetic carriers of the ff genotype showed low levels of 25(OH) vitamin D compared with the carriers of the F allele: mean (standard deviation), 23.1 (5.9) versus 27.9 (10.3) ng/ml (p &lt; 0.03). A similar result was observed for TGF-beta1 concentrations in diabetic carriers of ff genotype and patients carriers of the F allele (298.5 versus 276.6; p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Fok I polymorphism of VDR could have a marginal role in the immunologic disturbance in type 1 diabetes.

TI	Why is treating obesity so difficult? Justification for the role of bariatric surgery.
PG	144-6
AB	There is little evidence that public health measures adopted so far have had any impact on the rise in the prevalence of obesity. Weight-loss programs have a very high long-term failure rate. There is emerging evidence that weight is regulated by the hypothalamus and is physiologically defended. There is also a strong genetic predisposition to the development of obesity. The availability and promotion of high-energy foods and the absence of any obligatory need for physical activity compound the problem, but this social change is not easily reversible. One way forward is to focus public health measures on preventing obesity in children while making resources available to treat people who are already obese, including providing funding for bariatric surgery in public hospitals.

TI	[Nutritional epigenomics of metabolic syndrome].
PG	44-52
AB	The importance of epigenetic alterations has been acknowledged in cancer for about two decades by an increasing number of molecular oncologists who contributed to deciphering the epigenetic codes and machinery and opened the road for a new generation of drugs now in clinical trials. However, the relevance of epigenetics to common diseases such as metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease was less conspicuous. This review focuses on converging data supporting the hypothesis that, in addition to &quot;thrifty genotype&quot; inheritance, individuals with metabolic syndrome (MetS)--combining disturbances in glucose and insulin metabolism, excess of predominantly abdominally distributed weight, mild dyslipidemia and hypertension, with the subsequent development of obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD)--have suffered improper &quot;epigenetic programing&quot; during their fetal/postnatal development due to maternal inadequate nutrition and metabolic disturbances and also during their life-time. Moreover, as seen for obesity and T2D, MetS tends to appear earlier in childhood, to be more severe from generation to generation and to affect more pregnant women. Thus, in addition to maternal effects, MetS patients may display &quot;transgenerational effects&quot; via the incomplete erasure of epigenetic marks endured by their parents and grandparents. We highlight the susceptibility of epigenetic mechanisms controlling gene expression to environmental influences due to their inherent malleability, emphasizing the participation of transposable elements and the potential role of imprinted genes during critical time windows in epigenetic programming, from the very beginning of development throughout life. Increasing our understanding on epigenetic patterns significance and small molecules (nutrients, drugs) that reverse epigenetic (in) activation should provide us with the means to he obsolete human thrifty genotype into a &quot;squandering&quot; phenotype.

TI	Global DNA methylation changes in blood of patients with essential hypertension.
PG	CR149-155
AB	BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a common disease of the cardiovascular system and one of the main causes of mortality in the world. Its etiopathogenesis and molecular mechanisms are unknown. Epigenetic changes may play a role in its development. Therefore the level of 5-methylcytosine (5mC), a well-known epigenetic marker, was analyzed in DNA from the blood of essential hypertension patients. MATERIAL/METHODS: TLC chromatographic analysis of the DNA nucleotide composition was used to determine 5mC levels in blood DNA samples from 60 patients suffering from essential hypertension (30 with stage 1 and 30 with stage 2 hypertension) and 30 control subjects. RESULTS: The mean levels of 5mC were 1.80 + or	0.69 in the healthy subjects, 1.14 + or	0.48 in all the patients with essential hypertension, 1.29 + or	0.50 in those with stage 1, and 0.99 + or	0.42 in those with stage 2 of hypertension. Statistically significant differences in 5mC amount in DNA were observed between the control group and the whole patient group, the control group and each subgroup of patients, and the groups of patients with stage 1 and stage 2 of hypertension. The level of 5mC in the DNA of the essential hypertension patients was independent of clinical and biochemical factors. CONCLUSIONS: The level of 5mC in the DNA of patients suffering from essential hypertension is lower than in healthy people and depends of the progression of hypertension.

TI	Angiotensin II type 1 receptor gene A1166C polymorphism is associated with the increased risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension.
PG	523-9
AB	OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to evaluate the relation of parental history of hypertension to the development of PIH, and to assess the potential role of plausible candidate loci in the susceptibility to PIH. STUDY DESIGN: Five polymorphisms: ACE gene I/D and Pst1 RFLP polymorphism, AGT gene M235T polymorphism, AGTR1 gene A1166C polymorphism, and chymase gene CMA/B polymorphism were studied in 126 women suffering from PIH in comparison with 150 healthy pregnant women. Genotyping was performed using methods based on polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Among the PIH patients, positive parental history of hypertension (hypertension in both parents, in mother alone or in father alone) was significantly more frequent than in healthy pregnant women. Having a hypertensive father or mother statistically significantly increased the risk of PIH (odds ratio 4.34, 95% CI, 1.86-10.13, and 2.33, 95% CI, 1.29-4.12 respectively). CC genotype was significantly more frequent in women with PIH as compared with healthy controls and the C allele frequency was also significantly higher among the cases compared to controls. Having a CC genotype increased the risk of development of PIH 2.74 times (95% CI, 1.08-6.97). We observed no significant differences in genotype distributions or the allele frequencies of other examined polymorphisms. CONCLUSION: On the basis of the results of our study, we may suggest that AGTR1 gene A1166C polymorphism may predispose women to the development of PIH. It seems that ACE gene I/D and Pst1 RFLP polymorphism, AGT gene M235T polymorphism, and finally chymase gene CMA/B polymorphism do not play any significant role in the pathogenesis of PIH in Caucasian women.

TI	An age-dependent diet-modified effect of the PPARgamma Pro12Ala polymorphism in children.
PG	467-73
AB	Variation in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma gene alters the risk for adiposity in adults, with evidence of interaction with diet. We investigated the age-related association between the Pro12Ala variant (rs1801282) and diet in obesity-related traits in children. The Pro12Ala variant was assayed in 2102 young children aged 1 to 6 years and in 794 periadolescent children aged 10 to 12 years of Greek origin. In both cohorts, no differences were found in obesity traits between the Ala allele carriers and Pro/Pro homozygotes. Sex-stratified analysis showed that, in periadolescent boys, Ala carriers exhibited lower measures of skinfolds (triceps: 16.9 +/	6.9 vs 19.4 +/	7.9 mm, P = .01; subscapular: 9.6 +/	4.5 vs 11.2 +/	5.4 mm, P = .02). On the other hand, young girls who were Ala carriers presented higher measures of triceps skinfold thickness (10.5 +/	3.0 vs 9.9 +/	2.8 mm, P = .04). Nominal gene-diet interactions were revealed in periadolescents for saturated fatty acid (SFA) intake and skinfolds (P for interaction = .05). In Pro/Pro homozygous young girls, SFA and total fat (TF) intake was positively associated with higher body mass index (BMI) (P = .01), waist circumference (P = .02), and skinfold thickness (triceps-SFA: P = 10, triceps-TF: P = 10, subscapular-SFA: P = 10, subscapular-TF: P = 10). For Pro/Pro homozygotes, unsaturated fat intake was inversely associated with BMI (P = .04) in young girls, and with BMI (P = .03), waist circumference (P = .03), and triceps (P = .02) in periadolescent boys. Our results suggest that adiposity in children is influenced by the Pro12Ala polymorphism in a sex-specific and age-dependent manner. We also demonstrate evidence of an age-dependent gene-diet (SFA, TF) interaction, suggesting that the type of fat intake modifies the effect of the Pro12 allele on obesity-related measures.

TI	Genetic variation of FTO and TCF7L2 in premature adrenarche.
PG	1263-9
AB	Premature adrenarche (PA) has been associated with increased body mass index. Our aim was to determine whether the obesity-associated variant at fat mass and obesity gene (FTO) is more frequent in PA subjects. Furthermore, we hypothesized that altered Wnt signaling due to genetic variants at transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) could play a role in the polygenic pathogenesis of PA. We genotyped polymorphisms at FTO rs9939609 and at TCF7L2 rs7903146 and rs12255372 in 73 Finnish white prepubertal children with PA and in 97 age	and sex-matched healthy controls. In addition, we investigated the associations of these genetic variations with weight, height, circulating adrenocortical hormone levels, glucose metabolism, lipid profile, and blood pressure. The differences in the minor allele frequencies (MAFs) of rs9939609, rs7903146, and rs12255372 were not statistically significant between the PA and control groups (difference in MAFs [95% confidence interval]: -0.06 [-0.18, 0.05], 0.04 [-0.05, 0.12], and 0.01 [-0.07, 0.10]; P = .3, .4, and .8, respectively). However, the risk allele at TCF7L2 rs7903146 was more frequent in PA subjects than in controls when we restricted the analysis to the subjects with lower weight-for-height than the median of the PA subjects (weight-for-height &lt;108%, corresponding body mass index SD score &lt;0.79; difference in MAFs [95% confidence interval]: 0.12 [-0.001, 0.23]; P = .038). Risk variant at FTO rs9939609 associated with higher weight-for-height in the healthy children (P = .001). In conclusion, the minor variant at FTO rs9939609 seems to play no major role in the increased weight-for-height of PA subjects; but the risk allele at TCF7L2 rs7903146 may have a role in the pathogenesis of PA in lean subjects.

TI	Preliminary report: No association between TCF7L2 rs7903146 and euglycemic-clamp-derived insulin sensitivity in a mixed-age cohort.
PG	1369-71
AB	There are conflicting reports about the significance of TCF7L2 single nucleotide polymorphism rs7903146, a single nucleotide polymorphism found to be associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus in several genomewide association studies, and insulin sensitivity. The association of rs7903146 and euglycemic-clamp-derived insulin sensitivity was tested in a cohort of children and their parents. Four hundred seventy whites (from 226 families) and 89 African Americans (from 48 families) were included in the analysis. No significant associations were seen between rs7903146 and insulin sensitivity. Adjusted genotype means were consistent across races and generational subgroups.

TI	Impact of genetic and epigenetic factors from early life to later disease.
PG	S27-31
AB	There is ample evidence that subtle changes in the early environment, not restricted to the fetal period but expanded to the plastic phase of early development, influence adulthood disease appearance. There is also evidence that genetic background resulting from our evolution is an important contributor to susceptibility to perinatal imprinting. However, rapid adjustment and optimization, at times necessary for survival, require a type of plasticity that the genome sequence alone cannot achieve. Without changing the genomic backbone, epigenetic modulation, in reaction to a given environment, results in functional adaptation of the genomic response. Evolutionally acquired genomic susceptibilities and environmentally induced epigenomic modulations occurring early in life impact on later development of human diseases.

TI	Prenatal imprinting of postnatal specific appetites and feeding behavior.
PG	S22-6
AB	Epigenetic influences on the fetus's genotype have been shown to occur during intrauterine life. Experimentally imposed extracellular dehydration in pregnant rats (a model for human hyponatremia caused by gravidic vomiting) brings about a dramatic enhancement of salt appetite not only in the dam, but also in offspring when they reach adulthood. This phenomenon has been verified in human newborn infants and adults whose mothers experienced nausea and/or vomiting during pregnancy. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy enhances its palatability for the offspring. Ingestion of olfactory test substances like anise or carrot by the mother during pregnancy gives rise to a preference for the same testants in the offspring. Under	or overnutrition in the pregnant mother appears to play a role in reprogramming the postnatal regulation of both feeding and fat reserves in offspring. Both maternal under	and overnutrition during pregnancy predispose the offspring to later development of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. A careful examination of the systems concerned with the regulation of food intake, and the neurosubstances involved in such regulation, reveals some of the mechanisms by which maternal nutritional status can affect the offspring and their food-related behaviors.

TI	The beta(2)-adrenergic receptor Arg16-gly polymorphism and interactions involving beta(2)	and beta(3)-adrenergic receptor polymorphisms are associated with variations in longitudinal serum lipid profiles: the Bogalusa Heart Study.
PG	1184-91
AB	We examined the effects of combined genotypes of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (AR) Arg(16)-Gly and beta(3)-AR Trp(64)-Arg polymorphisms on longitudinal serum total (T-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) profiles in 1,198 subjects examined multiple times (6,488 observations) from 1973 to 1996 in the Bogalusa Heart Study, at ages from 4.5 to 38 years. Within 5-year age groups, T-C was significantly (P &lt;.05) higher in beta(2)-AR Arg(16)/Arg(16) homozygotes than in Gly(16) carriers among those 4 to 8 (171.4 +/	30.0 v 161.5 +/	27.7 mg/dL), 9 to 13 (167.7 +/	28.6 v 162.4 +/	27.4 mg/dL), and 14 to 18 (158.8 +/	29.6 v 154.7 +/	27.5 mg/dL) years of age, but not in those 19 to 23, 24 to 28, 29 to 33, or 34 to 38 years of age. The beta(3)-AR polymorphism was not associated with variation in either T-C or LDL-C. In multilevel polynomial growth curve models, the combination of the beta(2)-AR Arg(16)/Arg(16) genotype with either the beta(3)-AR Arg(64)/Arg(64) or Trp(64)/Arg(64) genotypes, denoted AA/AX, was associated with variation in longitudinal T-C (P &lt;.01) and LDL-C (P &lt;.01) profiles. The association between combined beta(2)/beta(3)-AR genotype and lipid profiles differed among race/sex groups, being most marked in black females, in whom the AA/AX combination was associated with higher T-C and LDL-C profiles across all ages. In White males, the AA/AX combination was most strongly associated with higher lipids in adults. In black males and white females, lipid profiles differed little between genotype groups. Our findings suggest that the beta(2)-AR Arg(16)-Gly genotype influences T-C and LDL-C levels in an age-specific manner, that it may interact with beta(3)-AR Trp(64)-Arg genotypes to influence longitudinal T-C and LDL-C profiles, and that the effect of combined beta(2)/beta(3)-AR genotypes on T-C and LDL-C profiles may differ among race/sex groups.

TI	Linkage and association studies of the lipoprotein lipase gene with postheparin plasma lipase activities, body fat, and plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations: the HERITAGE Family Study.
PG	432-9
AB	Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is responsible for the hydrolysis of triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins. The aims of the present study were (1) to test for potential linkages (sib-pair method) between postheparin plasma lipase (lipoprotein and hepatic lipase) activities, body fatness, plasma lipid concentrations, and LPL polymorphisms (Ser447Ter and a tetranucleotide repeat) and microsatellite markers flanking the LPL locus (D8S261 and D8S258); and (2) to investigate associations between the LPL Ser447Ter (S447X) polymorphism and these phenotypes. Data on 190 parents and 312 adult offspring from 99 Caucasian families participating in the HERITAGE Family Study were available for this study. Data were adjusted for the effects of age within sex, and lipases, lipid variables, and abdominal visceral fat were further adjusted for fat mass. A suggestive linkage was observed only between the S447X polymorphism and very-low-density (VLDL)-apolipoprotein B (apo B) (332 sib-pairs, P = .013). The S447X polymorphism was not associated with body fat phenotypes or postheparin plasma LPL (PH-LPL) activity (men, P = .19; women, P = .47). In contrast, the X447 allele carriers had lower plasma TG (men and women, P = .01), VLDL-TG (men and women, P = .01), and VLDL-apo B (men and women, P = .009). The relationships between the X447 allele and plasma TG, VLDL-TG, and VLDL-apo B in both genders were observed in obese (body mass index [BMI] &gt; or = 30 kg/m2) but not in normal-weight (BMI &lt; 25 kg/m2) subjects. Thus, the S447X polymorphism of the LPL gene is not associated with body fatness and postheparin plasma lipase activities. However, the obese carriers of the X447 allele have plasma TG, VLDL-TG, and plasma cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels equivalent to those of normal-weight sedentary adults.

TI	Nutritional models of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG	19-36
AB	In order to better understand the events which precede and precipitate the onset of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) several nutritional animal models have been developed. These models are generated by manipulating the diet of either the animal itself or its mother during her pregnancy and, in comparison to traditional genetic and knock out models, have the advantage that they more accurately reflect the aetiology of human T2DM. This chapter will discuss some of the most widely used nutritional models of T2DM: Diet-induced obesity (DIO) in adult rodents, and studies of prenatal and postnatal nutrition in offspring of mothers fed a low-protein diet or overnourished during pregnancy. Several common mechanisms have been identified through which these nutritional manipulations can lead to metabolic disease, including pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction, impaired insulin signalling in skeletal muscle and the excess accumulation of visceral adipose tissue and consequent deposition of non-esterified fatty acids in peripheral tissues resulting in peripheral insulin resistance. The following chapter will discuss each of these nutritional models, their application and relationship to human aetiology, and will highlight the important insights these models have provided into the pathogenesis of T2DM.

PG	817-23
AB	Prader Willi Syndrome (PWS) is characterized by typical appearance, obesity, short stature, hypothalamic hypogonadism, cryptorchidism, hypotonia, behavioural abnormalities and mental retardation. It is considered as a continuous genes syndrome with different genotypes: microdeletion of the region 15q11-q13 with paternal imprinting; maternal uniparental disomy (UPD) of chromosome 15; chromosomal rearrangement. Clinical manifestations evolve with age from newborn (hypotonia, poor sucking, hypoplastic external genitalia) to childhood (delay in psychomotor development, hyperphagia, obesity, acromicria and craniofacial dysmorphisms). We present five newborns who received an early diagnosis, based on clinical presentation. The early treatment and follow-up can in fact improve the natural evolution of the syndrome in order to prevent respiratory tract diseases and obesity, and to improve growth.

PG	18-25
AB	New methods are required for more objective estimation of the polymorphic genes contribution in multifactorial diseases. We suggest new approach based on the calculation of relative &quot;score&quot; as a sum of relevant genetic polymorphisms studied. Application of suggested approach is evaluated in analysis of the genes REN (19-83G&gt;A), AGT (M235T), ACE (I/D), AGTR1 (1166A&gt;C), AGTR2 (3123C&gt;A), BKR2 (-58T&gt;C and I/D) in children with arterial hypertension. The method proved that polymorphism of renin-angiotensin and kinin-bradikynin gene systems renders essential influence on formation of stably raised arterial pressure in girls.

TI	[Association of the SOD2 Ala(-9)Val and SOD3 Arg213Gly polymorphisms with diabetic polyneuropathy in patients with diabetes mellitus type 1].
PG	404-8
AB	Single-nucleotide polymorphisms of the genes for mitochondrial (SOD2) and extracellular (SOD3) superoxide dismutases were tested for association with diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) in diabetes mellitus (DM) type 1. Patients (n = 180) were divided into two groups with nonoverlapping (polar) phenotypes. Group DPN+ included 86 individuals with DPN and DM type 1 record of no more than 5 years. Group DPN-included 94 patients with DM type 1 record of more than 10 years but without clinical signs of DPN. Fisher's exact test revealed significant differences in allele and genotype frequencies for the two groups. Higher frequencies of SOD2 allele Val and genotype Val/Val and of SOD3 allele Arg and genotype Arg/Arg were established for group DPN+. On this evidence, SOD2 and SOD3 were associated with DPN in DM type 1.

TI	Polymorphisms in 5'-flanking regions of genes encoding adiponectin, leptin, and resistin are not associated with obesity of Polish children and adolescents.
PG	1793-8
AB	Genes encoding adipokines are important functional candidates for development of obesity. In this study we screened for polymorphism 5'-flanking regions of the adiponectin (ADIPOQ), leptin (LEP) and resistin (RETN) genes in a cohort of Polish obese children and adolescents (n = 243) and a control group of non-obese adults (n = 100). Altogether 13 SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) and 1 InDel (insertion/deletion polymorphism) were found. Among them five polymorphisms, localized in the LEP gene, turned out to be novel, but their distribution was insufficient for association studies. We found no consistent evidence for association between obesity and the SNPs demonstrating minor allele frequency (MAF) above 0.2 (ADIPOQ: -11377C&gt;G, LEP: -2548C&gt;T, 19A&gt;G, RETN: -1300G&gt;A, -1258C&gt;T, -420C&gt;G). Comparison of polymorphisms distribution in patients and control group suggested association with ADIPOQ -11377C&gt;G (Pearson test P = 2.76 x 10(-11)), however, we did not observe any effect of this polymorphism on BMI or relative BMI (RBMI) within obese patients (P = 0.41). We conclude that the tested SNPs are not useful markers of childhood and adolescence obesity in Polish population.

TI	Early and late weight gain and the timing of puberty.
PG	140-5
AB	Nutrition is an important regulator of the tempo of growth and obesity is usually associated with tall childhood stature and earlier pubertal development. Several longitudinal studies have demonstrated that timing of puberty is most closely linked to infancy weight gain: suggesting an early window for programming of growth and development. Earlier puberty in the UK MRC 1946 birth cohort was related to smaller size at birth and rapid growth between 0 and 2 years. Rapid early weight gain leads to taller childhood stature and higher insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) levels, possibly through early induction of growth hormone (GH) receptor numbers, and such children are also at risk of childhood obesity. In the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, rapid infancy weight gain was associated with increased risk of obesity at 5 and 8 years, with evidence of insulin resistance, exaggerated adrenarche and reduced levels of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). Potentially the elevated IGF-I and adrenal androgen levels, increased aromatase activity and increased 'free' sex steroid levels consequent to lower SHBG levels could all promote activity of the GnRH pulse generator. In addition obese children have higher leptin levels, a proven permissive factor in initiating LH pulsatility. Obesity could also affect the rate of progression through puberty as nutrition and SHBG may act respectively as an accelerator and brake on peripheral sex steroid action. Early weight gain and early pubertal development might also be associated with loss of the pubertal growth spurt perhaps through obesity-related suppression of GH secretion. Trans-generational recurrence of low birth weight, early catch-up weight gain, earlier menarche, and shorter adult stature have been observed in women, and could contribute to the strong heritability in age at menarche.

TI	Cloning: experience from the mouse and other animals.
PG	241-8
AB	Cloning mammals has been successful for many years by splitting an early embryo or transferring embryonic cell nuclei into enucleated oocytes. Cloning is now possible with adult somatic cells. At present, cloning efficiency--as determined by the proportion of live offspring developed from all oocytes that received donor cell nuclei--is low regardless of the cell type (including, embryonic stem (ES) cells) and animal species used. In all animals, except of Japanese black beef cattle, the vast majority (&gt;97%) of cloned embryos perish before reaching full term. Even in the Japanese cattle, less than 20% of cloned embryos reach the adulthood. This low efficiency of cloning seems to be due largely to faulty epigenetic reprogramming of donor cell nuclei after transfer into recipient oocytes. Cloned embryos with major epigenetic errors die before or soon after implantation. Those with relatively 'minor' epigenetic errors may survive birth and reach adulthood. We found that almost all fetuses of inbred mice die at birth from respiratory problems, while those of hybrid mice do not, suggesting that genomic heterogeneity masks-to some extent-faulty epigenetic errors. Thus far, the majority of cloned mice that survived birth, had a normal life span and were fertile. However, these animals may not be totally free of health problems. Postpubertal obesity in certain strains of mice is one example. A trial and error approach may discover better cells for cloning, but it would be wiser to understand the molecular mechanisms of epigenetic nuclear programming and reprogramming to find the way to make cloning safer and more efficient. The relatively high cloning success rate in the Japanese black cattle may provide us a clue of solving the problem of high mortality of cloned offspring.

TI	Increased protein nitration in mitochondrial diseases: evidence for vessel wall involvement.
PG	M110.002964
AB	Mitochondrial diseases (MD) are heterogeneous disorders because of impairment of respiratory chain function leading to oxidative stress. We hypothesized that in MD the vascular endothelium may be affected by increased oxidative/nitrative stress causing a reduction of nitric oxide availability. We therefore, investigated the pathobiology of vasculature in MD patients by assaying the presence of 3-nitrotyrosine in muscle biopsies followed by the proteomic identification of proteins which undergo tyrosine nitration. We then measured the flow-mediated vasodilatation as a proof of altered nitric oxide generation/bioactivity. Here, we show that 3-nitrotyrosine staining is specifically located in the small vessels of muscle tissue and that the reaction is stronger and more evident in a significant percentage of vessels from MD patients as compared with controls. Eleven specific proteins which are nitrated under pathological conditions were identified; most of them are involved in energy metabolism and are located mainly in mitochondria. In MD patients the flow-mediated vasodilatation was reduced whereas baseline arterial diameters, blood flow velocity and endothelium-independent vasodilatation were similar to controls. The present results provide evidence that in MD the vessel wall is a target of increased oxidative/nitrative stress.

TI	Variable number of tandem repeats of the insulin gene determines susceptibility to latent autoimmune diabetes in adults.
PG	43-9
AB	BACKGROUND: The different clinical presentations of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) and type 1 diabetes mellitus may be the result of susceptibility genes in determining the mode of onset. We analyzed the 5' polymorphisms of the insulin mini-satellite region (INS), a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) [repeat units; RU]. We evaluated the association of the different INS-VNTR alleles in patient susceptibility to LADA autoimmune diabetes. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first study of this kind performed in a Caucasian population. METHODS: From an group of 160 Argentinean patients previously characterized as having LADA, we selected 44 patients who presented with humoral autoimmunity for genotyping and compared them to 88 patients with type 1 diabetes and 138 healthy individuals. The INS-VNTR allele classes were determined by Southern blotting (class I: 21-44RU; class III: 138-159RU). Subjects with class I alleles were further studied using PCR amplification to determine the exact length of the alleles (short 1S: 22-37RU; medium 1M: 38-41RU; large 1L: 42-43RU). Allelic and genotype frequencies were estimated by chi(2) tests for independence with 2 x 2 contingency tables and the relative risks (RR) were determined using GraphPad InStat software. RESULTS: We observed differential associations among the class I alleles when comparing patients with LADA (80.6%) and type 1 diabetes (81.3%) with the controls (70%; p &lt; 0.005). This increase was largely due to the high frequency of the 1S/S genotype (63.6% LADA vs 37% controls, with a p-value of 0.0019 [p1]; 53.4% type 1 diabetes vs 37% controls, with a p-value of 0.0149 [p2]). Remarkably, all LADA patients genotyped as class I homozygous had the shorter (S) class I allele (100%). Differences in the overall 1S distribution were observed: in LADA the 94.4% of the alleles were equal to or smaller than 35RU, while in patients with type 1 diabetes it was 78.3% and in controls 74.1%. Moreover, the relative risks associated with the 1S/S genotype for patients with LADA showed a substantial increase with respect to those with type 1 diabetes (52%) when we compare them to the controls (1S/S LADA/control, 2.282 [RR1] vs type 1 diabetes/control, 1.497 [RR2]). CONCLUSION: The presence of the 1S allele could be considered a risk factor in LADA patients, as previously reported for type 1 diabetes. The class I INS-VNTR allele in LADA increases genetic susceptibility to disease development.

TI	Assessment of SNRPN expression as a molecular tool in the diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome.
PG	5-10
AB	BACKGROUND: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is associated with lesions of the paternal chromosome 15q11	13. Recently, loss of expression of a paternally expressed gene in this region, SNRPN, has been proposed as a molecular hallmark of PWS. The goal of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of SNRPN expression in a well-characterized cohort of PWS patients. METHODS: SNRPN expression was analyzed by reverse transcription coupled to polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes and subjected to multiplex RT-PCR in which expression of SNRPN and a constituitively expressed internal control gene were analyzed. The amplified products were electrophoresed in agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. RESULTS: Multiplex RT-PCR was applied to RNAs isolated from 30 normal control subjects and 30 well	characterized PWS patients. All control patients expressed the SNRPN and internal control genes. In contrast, all 30 PWS patients demonstrated loss of SNRPN expression, with integrity of RNA being demonstrated by the presence of internal control gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: Loss of SNRPN expression appears to be a consistent finding in PWS. Expression analysis of SNRPN offers a novel approach for the diagnostic evaluation of PWS that is robust and can be performed in a single day.

TI	Investigation of LRP8 gene in 1p31 QTL linked to LDL peak particle diameter in the Quebec family study.
PG	448-52
AB	The small, dense LDL phenotype is associated with an increased cardiovascular disease risk. A genome-wide scan performed on 236 nuclear families of the Quebec Family Study (QFS) revealed a quantitative trait locus affecting LDL peak particle diameter (LDL-PPD) and density on the 1p31 region. This region contains the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 8 (LRP8) gene. LRP8, a receptor for apolipoprotein (apo) E, modulates apoE levels, thus contributing to plasma cholesterol and triglyceride (TG) concentrations. We investigate the effects of LRP8 polymorphisms on LDL-PPD, on the relative proportion of small LDL (&lt;255A) and the absolute concentration of cholesterol among the small LDL particles. LRP8 rs5174 was associated with LDL-PPD and estimated cholesterol concentrations in the small LDL particles adjusted for the effects of age and sex (p=0.008, p=0.04, respectively). LRP8 rs3820198 was associated with total and LDL-cholesterol levels as well as with apoB concentrations adjusted for the effects of age and sex (p=0.005, p=0.004 and p=0.01, respectively) but not with LDL size-related variables. These results suggest that LRP8 gene polymorphisms influence plasma cholesterol levels as well as size and composition of LDL particles.

TI	Methylation of TFAM gene promoter in peripheral white blood cells is associated with insulin resistance in adolescents.
PG	83-7
AB	PURPOSE: To explore whether DNA methylation of the mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) promoter is associated with insulin resistance in a sample of adolescents with features of metabolic syndrome. METHODS: The data and blood samples were collected from 122 adolescents out of a cross-sectional study of 934 high-school students. The population was divided into two groups: noninsulin resistance (NIR) and insulin resistance (IR). After bisulfite treatment of genomic DNA from peripheral leukocytes, we used methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to assess DNA methylation of three putative methylation target sites (CpG) in the TFAM promoter. RESULTS: The ratio of the promoter methylated DNA/unmethylated DNA was 0.012+/-0.0009 (1.2% of alleles), and inversely correlated with the biochemical features of insulin resistance (plasma fasting insulin R: -0.26, p&lt;0.004 and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index R: -0.27, p&lt;0.002), and obesity (R: -0.27, p&lt;0.002). Multiple regression analysis showed that the log-transformed HOMA index correlated with the status of promoter methylation of TFAM, independently of body mass index (BMI) Z score (beta: -0.33+/-0.094, p=0.00094). Finally, the TFAM promoter methylated DNA/unmethylated DNA ratio was found to be significantly associated with insulin resistance as dichotomous variable (NIR n=45, 0.014+/-0.002 and IR n=77, 0.011+/-0.001, respectively, p&lt;0.016). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest a potential role of promoter TFAM methylation in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in adolescents.

TI	LEP 3'HVR is associated with obesity and leptin levels in Brazilian individuals.
PG	374-80
AB	Leptin plays an important role in satiety signaling and is related to obesity. Variants of leptin gene (LEP) have been associated to differences in plasma leptin levels and obesity-related phenotypes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association of LEP 3'HVR and leptin concentrations and obesity-related traits in our population. Anthropometrics and systolic/diastolic pressure were measured in 210 unrelated Brazilian individuals. Blood samples were collected for quantification of leptin, glucose and lipids and DNA extraction. LEP 3'HVR polymorphic region was amplified by PCR and fragments were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Obesity was associated with hypertension, hyperglycemia, obesity-related traits, plasma leptin and serum lipids (p &lt; 0.05). The frequency of LEP 3'HVR class I alleles (I/I + I/II genotypes) was higher in obese (p = 0.043) than in non-obese individuals. Multivariate logistic regression showed that the risk for obesity is nine times higher in hypertensive individuals and two times higher in class I alleles carriers. The presence of class I alleles was associated with increased BMI and WC. Plasma leptin was related to class I alleles in women (p &lt; 0.05). No association was found between LEP 3'HVR and hypertension or risk factors for CAD in our sample. Our results suggest that LEP 3'HVR is an important predictor for obesity-related traits and leptin plasma levels.

TI	Common polymorphisms in the PPARgamma2 and IRS-1 genes and their interaction influence serum adiponectin concentration in young Finnish men.
PG	344-8
AB	The Gly972Arg substitution of the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) gene and the Pro12Pro genotype of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 2 (PPARgamma2) gene have been suggested to be associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In this study, the influence of these two polymorphisms on serum adiponectin concentrations was investigated. The Pro12Ala polymorphism of the PPARgamma2 gene and the Gly972Arg polymorphism of the IRS-1 gene were genotyped in 252 young Finnish servicemen. The Ala12Ala genotype of PPARgamma2 was associated with a higher adiponectin level compared to the Pro12Ala genotype (p=0.02) and the Pro12Pro genotype (p=0.02). Total (p=0.02) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (p=0.03) levels were higher in subjects with the Pro12Pro genotype compared to the Pro12Ala genotype. No difference was observed in serum adiponectin level between the IRS-1 genotype groups. The subjects with X972Arg of this gene had high total and LDL cholesterol levels (p&lt;0.05). The interaction between the PPARgamma2 and IRS-1 genes with respect to their effects on adiponectin levels was statistically significant (p=0.02). Adiponectin was significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) in subjects who simultaneously had the Ala/Ala (PPARgamma2)+Gly/Gly (IRS-1) genotype combination compared to subjects with the Pro/Pro+Gly/Gly and Pro/Ala+Gly/Gly genotype combinations. Total and LDL cholesterol was higher (p&lt;0.05) in subjects with Pro/Pro+X/Arg compared to subjects with the two before mentioned genotype combinations. We conclude that the Ala12Ala genotype of PPARgamma2 is associated with elevated adiponectin level, and that the PPARgamma2 and IRS-1 genes have a possible interaction in their effects on adiponectin concentration.

TI	Maternal and offspring MTHFR gene C677T polymorphism as predictors of congenital atrial septal defect and patent ductus arteriosus.
PG	51-4
AB	To observe the association of MTHFR gene C677T locus polymorphism with occurrence of congenital heart defects (CHDs), 21 patients with atrial septal defect (ASD), 35 patients with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), one patient with both conditions combined, and their biological parents were collected as the case group. Another 104 normal individuals and their biological parents without a family history of birth defects were selected as the control group. MTHFR C677T genotypes of each sample were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The results showed for the occurrence of ASD, the odds ratio (OR) of TT genotype was 4.08 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.28-13.24] compared with CT genotype. For the occurrence of PDA, the ORs of TT were 3.44 (95% CI = 0.89-16.13) and 2.38 (95% CI = 0.92-6.14) compared with CC and CT genotypes, respectively. Author as meant? Compared with CC + CT genotype combination, the ORs of TT were 3.95 (95% CI = 1.38-11.44) and 2.60 (95% CI = 1.02-6.36) for ASD and PSD respectively. The results also had sex differences and the statistical significance was only observed in male ASD and female PDA. The ORs of T allele carriers were 2.29 (95% CI = 1.08-4.92) and 1.88 (95% CI = 1.02-3.47) compared with C allele for the occurrences of ASD and PDA respectively. The analysis of parents genotype showed that the OR of TT mothers was 2.31 (95% CI = 0.96-5.59, P &lt; 0.05) compared with (CC + CT) for the occurrence of PDA in offspring. So this study could give a clue that MTHFR C677T locus variation was related with occurrence of ASD and PDA, and the carriers of TT genotype and T allele had higher risk of diseases. The mother carrying TT genotype was associated with occurrence of PDA in offspring.

TI	Genomic imprinting of IGF2 is maintained in infantile hemangioma despite its high level of expression.
PG	117-23
AB	Hemangioma, the most common tumor of infancy, is characterized by rapid growth and slow regression. Increased mRNA expression of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) has been detected in the proliferating phase by cDNA microarray analysis, but the underlying mechanism causing the increase remains unknown. Here, using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry, we show that IGF2 is highly expressed in both proliferating and involuting phase hemangioma, but is not detectable in other vascular lesions such as pyogenic granuloma, venous malformation, lymphatic malformation, or in normal infant skin. Loss of imprinting of the Igf2 gene has been associated with IGF2 overexpression in a variety of childhood tumors. To determine if loss of imprinting and consequent bi-allelic expression might contribute to the increased expression of IGF2, we examined the genomic imprinting status of Igf2 in 48 individual hemangiomas. We determined allele-specific Igf2 expression using reverse transcriptase-PCR combined with analysis of an Apa I-sensitive restriction fragment length polymorphism. Similar to heterozygous normal skin controls, all 15 informative hemangiomas showed uniform mono-allelic expression of Igf2. Therefore, loss of imprinting is not involved in the increased expression of IGF2 in infantile hemangioma.

TI	Familial Wolfram syndrome due to compound heterozygosity for two novel WFS1 mutations.
PG	1353-7
AB	PURPOSE: To describe the first instance of genotyping in a Latin American family with Wolfram syndrome (WS). METHODS: Four affected siblings and their healthy parents were studied. Ophthalmologic examination included best corrected visual acuity determination, funduscopy, fluorescein retinal angiography, and Goldmann kinetic perimetry. Molecular methods included linkage analysis using microsatellites markers located on the markers located on the Wofram syndrome 1 (WFS1) region at 4p16.1, PCR amplification and direct nucleotide sequencing analysis of the complete coding region and exon/intron junctions of WFS1. In addition, allele-specific cloning and sequencing techniques were used to characterize a heterozygous frameshift mutation. RESULTS: The four affected siblings presented with a homogeneous clinical picture characterized by early onset diabetes mellitus, severe optic atrophy, and progressive hearing loss. Linkage analysis indicated that all four sibs were heterozygous for markers linked to the WFS1 region and that each inherited the same allele from the mother and the same from the father, suggesting compound heterozygosity. Direct WFS1 analysis disclosed a paternally inherited novel missense R177P mutation whereas allele-specific cloning and sequencing revealed a novel WFS1 16 bp deletion that was inherited from the mother. CONCLUSIONS: Our report of two novel WFS1 mutations expands the molecular spectrum of Wolfram syndrome. This is the first documented case of the molecular basis of the disease in a Latin American family. Analysis of more patients from this population will establish if compound heterozygosity is commonly found in affected individuals from this ethnic group.

TI	Epigenetics in women's health care.
PG	225-35
AB	Epigenetics refers to structural modifications to genes that do not change the nucleotide sequence itself but instead control and regulate gene expression. DNA methylation, histone modification, and RNA regulation are some of the mechanisms involved in epigenetic modification. Epigenetic changes are believed to be a result of changes in an organism's environment that result in fixed and permanent changes in most differentiated cells. Some environmental changes that have been linked to epigenetic changes include starvation, folic acid, and various chemical exposures. There are periods in an organism's life cycle in which the organism is particularly susceptible to epigenetic influences; these include fertilization, gametogenesis, and early embryo development. These are also windows of opportunity for interventions during the reproductive life cycle of women to improve maternal-child health. New data suggest that epigenetic influences might be involved in the regulation of fetal development and the pathophysiology of adult diseases such as cancer, diabetes, obesity, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Various epigenetic mechanisms may also be involved in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. Additionally, environmental exposures are being held responsible for causing epigenetic changes that lead to a disease process. Exposure to heavy metals, bioflavonoids, and endocrine disruptors, such as bisphenol A and phthalates, has been shown to affect the epigenetic memory of an organism. Their long-term effects are unclear at this point, but many ongoing studies are attempting to elucidate the pathophysiological effects of such gene-environment interactions.

TI	Extreme variability of skeletal and cardiac muscle involvement in patients with mutations in exon 11 of the lamin A/C gene.
PG	602-9
AB	Mutations of the LMNA gene, encoding the nuclear envelope proteins lamins A and C, give rise to Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy and to limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 1B (EDMD and LGMD1B). With one exception, all the reported EDMD and LGMD1B mutations are confined to the first 10 exons of the gene. We report four separate cases, with mutations in the same codon of LMNA exon 11, characterized by remarkable variability of clinical findings, in addition to features not previously reported. One patient had congenital weakness and died in early childhood. In two other patients, severe cardiac problems arose early and, in one of these, cardiac signs preceded by many years the onset of skeletal muscle weakness. The fourth case had a mild and late-onset LGMD1B phenotype. Our cases further expand the clinical spectrum associated with mutations in the LMNA gene and provide new evidence of the role played by the C-terminal domain of lamin A.

TI	Inflammatory skin and bowel disease linked to ADAM17 deletion.
PG	1502-8
AB	We performed genetic and immunohistochemical studies in a sister and brother with autosomal recessive neonatal inflammatory skin and bowel lesions. The girl died suddenly at 12 years of age from parvovirus B19-associated myocarditis; her brother had mild cardiomyopathy. We identified a loss-of-function mutation in ADAM17, which encodes a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (also called tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-alpha]-converting enzyme, or TACE), as the probable cause of this syndrome. Peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from the brother at 17 years of age showed high levels of lipopolysaccharide-induced production of interleukin-1beta and interleukin-6 but impaired release of TNF-alpha. Despite repeated skin infections, this young man has led a relatively normal life. (Funded by Barts and the London Charity and the European Commission Seventh Framework Programme.).

TI	Genetic compensation in a human genomic disorder.
PG	1211-6
AB	Cytogenetic studies of the parents of a girl with the DiGeorge (or velocardiofacial) syndrome, who carried a deletion at 22q11.2, revealed an unexpected rearrangement of both 22q11.2 regions in the unaffected father. He carried a 22q11.2 deletion on one copy of chromosome 22 and a reciprocal 22q11.2 duplication on the other copy of chromosome 22. Genetic compensation, which is consistent with the normal phenotype of the father, was shown through quantitative-expression analyses of genes located within the genetic region associated with the DiGeorge syndrome. This finding has implications for genetic counseling and represents a case of genetic compensation in a human genomic disorder.

TI	Shared and distinct genetic variants in type 1 diabetes and celiac disease.
PG	2767-77
AB	BACKGROUND: Two inflammatory disorders, type 1 diabetes and celiac disease, cosegregate in populations, suggesting a common genetic origin. Since both diseases are associated with the HLA class II genes on chromosome 6p21, we tested whether non-HLA loci are shared. METHODS: We evaluated the association between type 1 diabetes and eight loci related to the risk of celiac disease by genotyping and statistical analyses of DNA samples from 8064 patients with type 1 diabetes, 9339 control subjects, and 2828 families providing 3064 parent-child trios (consisting of an affected child and both biologic parents). We also investigated 18 loci associated with type 1 diabetes in 2560 patients with celiac disease and 9339 control subjects. RESULTS: Three celiac disease loci--RGS1 on chromosome 1q31, IL18RAP on chromosome 2q12, and TAGAP on chromosome 6q25--were associated with type 1 diabetes (P&lt;1.00x10(-4)). The 32-bp insertion-deletion variant on chromosome 3p21 was newly identified as a type 1 diabetes locus (P=1.81x10(-8)) and was also associated with celiac disease, along with PTPN2 on chromosome 18p11 and CTLA4 on chromosome 2q33, bringing the total number of loci with evidence of a shared association to seven, including SH2B3 on chromosome 12q24. The effects of the IL18RAP and TAGAP alleles confer protection in type 1 diabetes and susceptibility in celiac disease. Loci with distinct effects in the two diseases included INS on chromosome 11p15, IL2RA on chromosome 10p15, and PTPN22 on chromosome 1p13 in type 1 diabetes and IL12A on 3q25 and LPP on 3q28 in celiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: A genetic susceptibility to both type 1 diabetes and celiac disease shares common alleles. These data suggest that common biologic mechanisms, such as autoimmunity-related tissue damage and intolerance to dietary antigens, may be etiologic features of both diseases.

TI	Increased high-density lipoprotein levels caused by a common cholesteryl-ester transfer protein gene mutation.
PG	1234-8
AB	BACKGROUND AND METHODS: The plasma cholesteryl-ester transfer protein (CETP) catalyzes the transfer of cholesteryl esters from high-density lipoprotein (HDL) to other lipoproteins. We recently described a Japanese family with increased HDL levels and CETP deficiency due to a splicing defect of the CETP gene. To assess the frequency and phenotype of this condition, we screened 11 additional families with high HDL levels by means of a radioimmunoassay for CETP and DNA analysis. RESULTS: We found the same CETP gene mutation in four families from three different regions of Japan. Analysis of restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms of the mutant CETP allele showed that all probands were homozygous for the identical haplotype. Family members homozygous for CETP deficiency (n = 10) had moderate hypercholesterolemia (mean total cholesterol level [+/	SD], 7.01 +/	0.83 mmol per liter), markedly increased levels of HDL cholesterol (4.24 +/	1.01 mmol per liter) and apolipoprotein A-I, and decreased levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.99 +/	0.80 mmol per liter) and apolipoprotein B. Members heterozygous for the deficiency (n = 20), whose CETP levels were in the lower part of the normal range, had moderately increased levels of HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I and an increased ratio of HDL subclass 2 to HDL subclass 3, as compared with unaffected family members (1.5 +/	0.8 vs. 0.7 +/	0.4). CETP deficiency was not found in six unrelated subjects with elevated HDL cholesterol levels who were from different parts of the United States. CONCLUSIONS: CETP deficiency appears to be a frequent cause of increased HDL levels in the population of Japan, possibly because of a founder effect. The results that we observed in heterozygotes suggest that CETP normally plays a part in the regulation of levels of HDL subclass 2. There was no evidence of premature atherosclerosis in the families with CETP deficiency. In fact, the lipoprotein profile of persons with CETP deficiency is potentially antiatherogenic and may be associated with an increased life span.

TI	[Risk of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage is associated with endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene polymorphism].
PG	280-3
AB	OBJECTIVE: To study whether endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene (eNOS) polymorphisms is implicated in the development of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage. METHODS: Three groups of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage were selected to test this hypothesis, including 98 patients with cerebral vasospasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (ASAH), 96 with cerebral vasospasm following traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (TSAH), and 195 patients without cerebral vasospasm following aneurysmal or traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. The parents of 194 patients and 100 control subjects were also examined for transmission disequilibrium test according to a family-based study design to test the associations. RESULTS: We examined four eNOS gene polymorphisms, and two of these polymorphisms, the T to C substitution in the promoter at position -786 and the a-deletion/b-insertion in intron 4, were found to associate with cerebral vasospasm in subarachnoid hemorrhage in the case-control comparisons. For the former polymorphism, the risk of cerebral vasospasm was higher in C allele homozygotes than in the other two genotypes (odds ratio: 2.8, 95% CI: 1.4 to 5.6); for the latter polymorphism, the a-deletion carriers were exposed to a increased risk (odds ratio: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.3 to 4.0) in comparison with the noncarriers. The two polymorphisms were analyzed together as haplotypes in a family-based study using the transmission disequilibrium test. The C/a-deletion haplotype was transmitted from the heterozygous parents to cases of cerebral vasospasm in subarachnoid hemorrhage with a significantly higher frequency than expected (P=0.005). CONCLUSION: The findings of the case-control and family-based studies clearly demonstrate that DNA sequence differences in eNOS gene influence the risk of cerebral vasospasm in subarachnoid hemorrhage.

TI	New genetic loci implicated in fasting glucose homeostasis and their impact on type 2 diabetes risk.
PG	105-16
AB	Levels of circulating glucose are tightly regulated. To identify new loci influencing glycemic traits, we performed meta-analyses of 21 genome-wide association studies informative for fasting glucose, fasting insulin and indices of beta-cell function (HOMA-B) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in up to 46,186 nondiabetic participants. Follow-up of 25 loci in up to 76,558 additional subjects identified 16 loci associated with fasting glucose and HOMA-B and two loci associated with fasting insulin and HOMA-IR. These include nine loci newly associated with fasting glucose (in or near ADCY5, MADD, ADRA2A, CRY2, FADS1, GLIS3, SLC2A2, PROX1 and C2CD4B) and one influencing fasting insulin and HOMA-IR (near IGF1). We also demonstrated association of ADCY5, PROX1, GCK, GCKR and DGKB-TMEM195 with type 2 diabetes. Within these loci, likely biological candidate genes influence signal transduction, cell proliferation, development, glucose-sensing and circadian regulation. Our results demonstrate that genetic studies of glycemic traits can identify type 2 diabetes risk loci, as well as loci containing gene variants that are associated with a modest elevation in glucose levels but are not associated with overt diabetes.

TI	Prader-Willi phenotype caused by paternal deficiency for the HBII-85 C/D box small nucleolar RNA cluster.
PG	719-21
AB	Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is caused by deficiency for one or more paternally expressed imprinted transcripts within chromosome 15q11-q13, including SNURF-SNRPN and multiple small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). Balanced chromosomal translocations that preserve expression of SNURF-SNRPN and centromeric genes but separate the snoRNA HBII-85 cluster from its promoter cause PWS. A microdeletion of the HBII-85 snoRNAs in a child with PWS provides, in combination with previous data, effectively conclusive evidence that deficiency of HBII-85 snoRNAs causes the key characteristics of the PWS phenotype, although some atypical features suggest that other genes in the region may make more subtle phenotypic contributions.

TI	Hypomethylation of multiple imprinted loci in individuals with transient neonatal diabetes is associated with mutations in ZFP57.
PG	949-51
AB	We have previously described individuals presenting with transient neonatal diabetes and showing a variable pattern of DNA hypomethylation at imprinted loci throughout the genome. We now report mutations in ZFP57, which encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor expressed in early development, in seven pedigrees with a shared pattern of mosaic hypomethylation and a conserved range of clinical features. This is the first description of a heritable global imprinting disorder that is compatible with life.

TI	Disruption of oxygen homeostasis underlies congenital Chuvash polycythemia.

AB	Chuvash polycythemia is an autosomal recessive disorder that is endemic to the mid-Volga River region. We previously mapped the locus associated with Chuvash polycythemia to chromosome 3p25. The gene associated with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, VHL, maps to this region, and homozygosity with respect to a C--&gt;T missense mutation in VHL, causing an arginine-to-tryptophan change at amino-acid residue 200 (Arg200Trp), was identified in all individuals affected with Chuvash polycythemia. The protein VHL modulates the ubiquitination and subsequent destruction of hypoxia-inducible factor 1, subunit alpha (HIF1alpha). Our data indicate that the Arg200Trp substitution impairs the interaction of VHL with HIF1alpha, reducing the rate of degradation of HIF1alpha and resulting in increased expression of downstream target genes including EPO (encoding erythropoietin), SLC2A1 (also known as GLUT1, encoding solute carrier family 2 (facilitated glucose transporter), member 1), TF (encoding transferrin), TFRC (encoding transferrin receptor (p90, CD71)) and VEGF (encoding vascular endothelial growth factor).

TI	Paternal transmission of the very common class I INS VNTR alleles predisposes to childhood obesity.
PG	96-9
AB	To identify some of the genetic factors that contribute to obesity in children of Central European and North African descent, we studied the parental transmission of alleles at the insulin locus to offspring with early-onset obesity. A variable nucleotide tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism upstream of the insulin gene (INS) is associated with variations in the expression of INS and the nearby gene encoding insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2). We found an excess of paternal transmission of class I VNTR alleles to obese children: children who inherited a class I allele from their father (but not those inheriting it from their mother) had a relative risk of early-onset obesity of 1.8. Due to the frequency of class I alleles in this population, this risk concerns 65-70% of all infants. These results suggest that increased in utero expression of paternal INS or IGF2 due to the class I INS VNTR allele may predispose offspring to postnatal fat deposition.

TI	De novo deletions of SNRPN exon 1 in early human and mouse embryos result in a paternal to maternal imprint switch.
PG	74-8
AB	Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a neurogenetic disease characterized by infantile hypotonia, gonadal hypoplasia, obsessive behaviour and neonatal feeding difficulties followed by hyperphagia, leading to profound obesity. PWS is due to a lack of paternal genetic information at 15q11-q13 (ref. 2). Five imprinted, paternally expressed genes map to the PWS region, MKRN3 (ref. 3), NDN (ref. 4), NDNL1 (ref. 5), SNRPN (refs 6-8 ) and IPW (ref. 9), as well as two poorly characterized framents designated PAR-1 and PAR-5 (ref. 10). Imprinting of this region involves a bipartite 'imprinting centre' (IC), which overlaps SNRPN (refs 10,11). Deletion of the SNRPN promoter/exon 1 region (the PWS IC element) appears to impair the establishment of the paternal imprint in the male germ line and leads to PWS. Here we report a PWS family in which the father is mosaic for an IC deletion on his paternal chromosome. The deletion chromosome has acquired a maternal methylation imprint in his somatic cells. We have made identical findings in chimaeric mice generated from two independent embryonic stem (ES) cell lines harbouring a similar deletion. Our studies demonstrate that the PWS IC element is not only required for the establishment of the paternal imprint, but also for its postzygotic maintenance.

TI	The insulin gene VNTR is associated with fasting insulin levels and development of juvenile obesity.
PG	444-6
AB	In millions of people, obesity leads to type 2 diabetes (T2D; also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus). During the early stages of juvenile obesity, the increase of insulin secretion in proportion to accumulated fat balances insulin resistance and protects patients from hyperglycaemia. After several decades, however,beta-cell function deteriorates and T2D develops in approximately 20% of obese patients. In modern societies, obesity has thus become the leading risk factor for T2D (ref. 5). The factors that predispose obese patients to alteration of insulin secretion upon gaining weight remain unknown. To determine which genetic factors predispose obese patients to beta-cell dysfunction, and possibly T2D, we studied single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the region of the insulin gene (INS) among 615 obese children. We found that, in the early phase of obesity, alleles of the INS variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) locus are associated with different effects of body fatness on insulin secretion. Young obese patients homozygous for class I VNTR alleles secrete more insulin than those with other genotypes.

TI	Mutations in NEUROD1 are associated with the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG	323-8
AB	The helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein NEUROD1 (also known as BETA2) functions as a regulatory switch for endocrine pancreatic development. In mice homozygous for a targeted disruption of Neurod, pancreatic islet morphogenesis is abnormal and overt diabetes develops due in part to inadequate expression of the insulin gene (Ins2). NEUROD1, following its heterodimerization with the ubiquitous HLH protein E47, regulates insulin gene (INS) expression by binding to a critical E-box motif on the INS promoter. Here we describe two mutations in NEUROD1, which are associated with the development of type 2 diabetes in the heterozygous state. The first, a missense mutation at Arg 111 in the DNA-binding domain, abolishes E-box binding activity of NEUROD1. The second mutation gives rise to a truncated polypeptide lacking the carboxy-terminal trans-activation domain, a region that associates with the co-activators CBP and p300 (refs 3,4). The clinical profile of patients with the truncated NEUROD1 polypeptide is more severe than that of patients with the Arg 111 mutation. Our findings suggest that deficient binding of NEUROD1 or binding of a transcriptionally inactive NEUROD1 polypeptide to target promoters in pancreatic islets leads to the development of type 2 diabetes in humans.

TI	Epigenetic inheritance at the agouti locus in the mouse.
PG	314-8
AB	Epigenetic modifications have effects on phenotype, but they are generally considered to be cleared on passage through the germ line in mammals, so that only genetic traits are inherited. Here we describe the inheritance of an epigenetic modification at the agouti locus in mice. In viable yellow ( A(vy)/a) mice, transcription originating in an intra-cisternal A particle (IAP) retrotransposon inserted upstream of the agouti gene (A) causes ectopic expression of agouti protein, resulting in yellow fur, obesity, diabetes and increased susceptibility to tumours. The pleiotropic effects of ectopic agouti expression are presumably due to effects of the paracrine signal on other tissues. Avy mice display variable expressivity because they are epigenetic mosaics for activity of the retrotransposon: isogenic Avy mice have coats that vary in a continuous spectrum from full yellow, through variegated yellow/agouti, to full agouti (pseudoagouti). The distribution of phenotypes among offspring is related to the phenotype of the dam; when an A(vy) dam has the agouti phenotype, her offspring are more likely to be agouti. We demonstrate here that this maternal epigenetic effect is not the result of a maternally contributed environment. Rather, our data show that it results from incomplete erasure of an epigenetic modification when a silenced Avy allele is passed through the female germ line, with consequent inheritance of the epigenetic modification. Because retrotransposons are abundant in mammalian genomes, this type of inheritance may be common.

TI	A gene encoding a transmembrane protein is mutated in patients with diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy (Wolfram syndrome).
PG	143-8
AB	Wolfram syndrome (WFS; OMIM 222300) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder defined by young-onset non-immune insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and progressive optic atrophy. Linkage to markers on chromosome 4p was confirmed in five families. On the basis of meiotic recombinants and disease-associated haplotypes, the WFS gene was localized to a BAC/P1 contig of less than 250 kb. Mutations in a novel gene (WFS1) encoding a putative transmembrane protein were found in all affected individuals in six WFS families, and these mutations were associated with the disease phenotype. WFS1 appears to function in survival of islet beta-cells and neurons.

AB	Size at birth is an important determinant of perinatal survival and has also been associated with the risk for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes in adult life. Common genetic variation that regulates fetal growth could therefore influence perinatal survival and predispose to the development of adult disease. We have tested the insulin gene (INS) variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) locus, which in Caucasians has two main allele sizes (class I and class III; ref. 3), as a functional candidate polymorphism for association with size at birth, as it has been shown to influence transcription of INS (refs 3-5). In a cohort of 758 term singletons (Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood; ALSPAC) followed longitudinally from birth to 2 years, we detected significant genetic associations with size at birth: class III homozygotes had larger mean head circumference (P=0.004) than class I homozygotes. These associations were amplified in babies who did not show postnatal realignment of growth (45%), and were also evident for length (P=0.015) and weight (P=0.009) at birth. The INS VNTR III/II genotype might have bestowed a perinatal survival during human history by conferring larger size at birth. Common genetic variation of this kind may contribute to reported associations between birth size and adult disease.

TI	The insulin gene is transcribed in the human thymus and transcription levels correlated with allelic variation at the INS VNTR-IDDM2 susceptibility locus for type 1 diabetes.
PG	293-7
AB	Type 1, or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is an autoimmune disease associated with loss of tolerance to several pancreatic islet cell molecules, including insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), ICA69 and the tyrosine phosphatase IA-2 (refs 1-3). Among several predisposing loci, IDDM2 maps to the insulin gene (INS) VNTR (variable number of tandem repeats) minisatellite on chromosome 11p15 (refs 4-9). Allelic variation at this VNTR locus correlates with steady-state levels of INS mRNA in pancreas and transfected rodent cell lines, but it is difficult to reconcile the association of lower INS mRNA levels in the pancreas with class III VNTRs that are dominantly protective from IDDM. We show that during fetal development and childhood, mRNAs for insulin and other islet cell autoantigens (GAD, ICA69, IA-2) are expressed at low levels in the human thymus. Critically, we also detect proinsulin and insulin protein. VNTR alleles correlate with differential INS mRNA expression in the thymus where, in contrast to the pancreas, protective class III VNTRs are associated with higher steady-state levels of INS mRNA expression. This finding provides a plausible explanation for the dominant protective effect of class III VNTRs, and suggests that diabetes susceptibility and resistance associated with IDDM2 may derive from the VNTR influence on INS transcription in the thymus. Higher levels of (pro)insulin in the thymus may promote negative selection (deletion) of insulin-specific T-lymphocytes which play a critical role in the pathogenesis of type-1 diabetes.

TI	Exclusion of SNRPN as a major determinant of Prader-Willi syndrome by a translocation breakpoint.
PG	452-4
AB	The predominant genetic defects in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) are 15q11-q13 deletions of paternal origin and maternal chromosome 15 uniparental disomy (UPD). In contrast, maternal deletions and paternal chromosome 15 UPD are associated with a different neurogenetic disorder, Angelman syndrome (AS). In both disorders, these mutations are associated with parent-of-origin specific methylation at several 15q11-q13 loci. The critical PWS region has been narrowed to a approximately 320-kb region between D15S63 and D15S174, encoding several imprinted transcripts, including PAR5, IPW, PAR1 (refs 7,8) and SNRPN, which has so far been considered a strong candidate for the PWS gene. A few PWS-associated microdeletions involving a putative imprinting centre (IC) proximal to SNRPN have also been observed. We have mapped the breakpoint of a balanced translocation (9;15)pat associated with most of the PWS features between SNRPN and IPWIPAR1. Methylation and expression studies indicate that the paternal SNRPN allele is unaffected by the translocation, while IPW and PAR1 are unexpressed. This focuses the attention on genes distal to the breakpoint as the main candidate for PWS genes, and is consistent with a cis action of the putative IC, and suggests that further studies of translocational disruption of the imprinted region may establish genotype-phenotype relationships in this presumptive contiguous gene syndrome.

TI	Nutritional programming of the metabolic syndrome.
PG	604-10
AB	The primary markers of the metabolic syndrome are central obesity, insulin resistance and hypertension. In this review, we consider the effect of changes in maternal nutrition during critical windows in fetal development on an individual's subsequent predisposition to the metabolic syndrome. The fetal origins of obesity, cardiovascular disease and insulin resistance have been investigated in a wide range of epidemiological and animal studies; these investigations highlight adaptations made by the nutritionally manipulated fetus that aim to maintain energy homeostasis to ensure survival. One consequence of such developmental plasticity may be a long term re-setting of cellular energy homeostasis, most probably via epigenetic modification of genes involved in a number of key regulatory pathways. For example, reduced maternal-fetal nutrition during early gestation to midgestation affects adipose tissue development and adiposity of the fetus by setting an increased number of adipocyte precursor cells. Importantly, clinically relevant adaptations to nutritional challenges in utero may only manifest as primary components of the metabolic syndrome if followed by a period of accelerated growth early in the postnatal period and/or if offspring become obese.

TI	Peripheral SMN restoration is essential for long-term rescue of a severe spinal muscular atrophy mouse model.
PG	123-6
LID	10.1038/nature10485 [doi]
AB	Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a motor neuron disease and the leading genetic cause of infant mortality; it results from loss-of-function mutations in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. Humans have a paralogue, SMN2, whose exon 7 is predominantly skipped, but the limited amount of functional, full-length SMN protein expressed from SMN2 cannot fully compensate for a lack of SMN1. SMN is important for the biogenesis of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles, but downstream splicing targets involved in pathogenesis remain elusive. There is no effective SMA treatment, but SMN restoration in spinal cord motor neurons is thought to be necessary and sufficient. Non-central nervous system (CNS) pathologies, including cardiovascular defects, were recently reported in severe SMA mouse models and patients, reflecting autonomic dysfunction or direct effects in cardiac tissues. Here we compared systemic versus CNS restoration of SMN in a severe mouse model. We used an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), ASO-10-27, that effectively corrects SMN2 splicing and restores SMN expression in motor neurons after intracerebroventricular injection. Systemic administration of ASO-10-27 to neonates robustly rescued severe SMA mice, much more effectively than intracerebroventricular administration; subcutaneous injections extended the median lifespan by 25 fold. Furthermore, neonatal SMA mice had decreased hepatic Igfals expression, leading to a pronounced reduction in circulating insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), and ASO-10-27 treatment restored IGF1 to normal levels. These results suggest that the liver is important in SMA pathogenesis, underscoring the importance of SMN in peripheral tissues, and demonstrate the efficacy of a promising drug candidate.

TI	Chronic high-fat diet in fathers programs beta-cell dysfunction in female rat offspring.
PG	963-6
AB	The global prevalence of obesity is increasing across most ages in both sexes. This is contributing to the early emergence of type 2 diabetes and its related epidemic. Having either parent obese is an independent risk factor for childhood obesity. Although the detrimental impacts of diet-induced maternal obesity on adiposity and metabolism in offspring are well established, the extent of any contribution of obese fathers is unclear, particularly the role of non-genetic factors in the causal pathway. Here we show that paternal high-fat-diet (HFD) exposure programs beta-cell 'dysfunction' in rat F(1) female offspring. Chronic HFD consumption in Sprague-Dawley fathers induced increased body weight, adiposity, impaired glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Relative to controls, their female offspring had an early onset of impaired insulin secretion and glucose tolerance that worsened with time, and normal adiposity. Paternal HFD altered the expression of 642 pancreatic islet genes in adult female offspring (P &lt; 0.01); genes belonged to 13 functional clusters, including cation and ATP binding, cytoskeleton and intracellular transport. Broader pathway analysis of 2,492 genes differentially expressed (P &lt; 0.05) demonstrated involvement of calcium-, MAPK	and Wnt-signalling pathways, apoptosis and the cell cycle. Hypomethylation of the Il13ra2 gene, which showed the highest fold difference in expression (1.76-fold increase), was demonstrated. This is the first report in mammals of non-genetic, intergenerational transmission of metabolic sequelae of a HFD from father to offspring.

TI	Evidence from Turner's syndrome of an imprinted X-linked locus affecting cognitive function.
PG	705-8
AB	Turner's syndrome is a sporadic disorder of human females in which all or part of one X chromosome is deleted. Intelligence is usually normal but social adjustment problems are common. Here we report a study of 80 females with Turner's syndrome and a single X chromosome, in 55 of which the X was maternally derived (45,X[m]) and in 25 it was of paternal origin (45,X[p]). Members of the 45,X[p] group were significantly better adjusted, with superior verbal and higher-order executive function skills, which mediate social interactions. Our observations suggest that there is a genetic locus for social cognition, which is imprinted and is not expressed from the maternally derived X chromosome. Neuropsychological and molecular investigations of eight females with partial deletions of the short arm of the X chromosome indicate that the putative imprinted locus escapes X-inactivation, and probably lies on Xq or close to the centromere on Xp. If expressed only from the X chromosome of paternal origin, the existence of this locus could explain why 46,XY males (whose single X chromosome is maternal) are more vulnerable to developmental disorders of language and social cognition, such as autism, than are 46,XX females.

TI	A rare haplotype of the vitamin D receptor gene is protective against diabetic nephropathy.
PG	497-503
AB	BACKGROUND: Vitamin D and its analogues are reported to have renoprotective effects in chronic kidney disease including diabetic nephropathy (DN). Vitamin D(3) is converted to 1,25(OH)D(3) by CYP2R1 and CYP27B1. The biological action of 1,25(OH)D(3) is mediated via its receptor. VDR, CYP27B1 or CYP2R1 gene variants could modify the biological activity of vitamin D(3). We have conducted the first case-control association study to determine the relationship between polymorphisms in VDR, CYP27B1 and CYP2R1 genes, and the risk of DN in individuals with type 1 diabetes. METHODS: Eight VDR single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs10735810 FokI C&gt;T, rs1544410 BsmI G&gt;A, rs7975232 ApaI G&gt;T, rs731236 TaqI T&gt;C, rs4303288 G&gt;T, rs11168275 C&gt;T, rs12721366 G&gt;A and rs2544043 G&gt;C were investigated with CYP27B1 rs4646536 T&gt;C and CYP2R1 rs10741657 G&gt;A. Genotyping was performed using pyrosequencing, Taqman, Sequenom or direct sequencing technologies in 1329 type 1 diabetics (655 nephropaths, 674 non-nephropaths). RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in genotype or allele frequencies between case and control groups for VDR, CYP27B1 or CYP2R1 SNPs, either before or after stratification by recruitment centre or when restricted to patients with end-stage renal disease. A previously identified haplotype block from rs1544410 to rs731236 was confirmed at the 3'-end of VDR. Comparison of haplotype frequencies identified the rare AGT haplotype as significantly protective against DN, 3.1% cases versus 5.8% controls; chi(2) = 11.05, Pc = 0.009 by the permutation test. CONCLUSIONS: Our study has identified a rare VDR haplotype that is protective against DN in patients with type 1 diabetes. Replication in a large, independent cohort is required to confirm this finding.

TI	Angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and the ACE Alu polymorphism in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.
PG	2323-7
AB	BACKGROUND: Previous studies concerning Alu I/D polymorphism in the ACE gene and ADPKD severity have used the Alu genotypes as a representative of the true biological variable, namely ACE activity. However, wide individual and ethnic differences in the proportion of variance in ACE activity explained by the I/D genotype may have confounded these studies. This investigation examines the association between ADPKD severity and ACE in terms of plasma enzyme activity and I/D genotypes in individuals from three different countries. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 307 ADPKD patients (116 Australian, 124 Bulgarian and 67 Polish) for determination of ACE activity levels and I/D genotypes. Chronic renal failure (CRF) was present in 117 patients and end-stage renal failure (ESRF) in 68 patients. RESULTS: ACE activity was related to the I/D genotype, showing a dosage effect of the D allele (P=0.006). The proportion of variance due to the Alu polymorphism was 14%. No difference in ACE activity and I/D genotype distribution was found between patients with CRF versus normal renal function (P=0.494; P=0.576) or between those with ESRF versus those without ESRF (P=0.872; P=0.825). No effect of the I/D genotype on age at development and progression to renal failure (CRF; ESRF) was detected in the overall group, and in subgroups based on ethnic origin, linkage status and sex. CONCLUSION: ACE is not likely to play a role as a determinant of ADPKD phenotype severity.

TI	DNA polymorphisms in the ACE gene, serum ACE activity and the risk of nephropathy in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
PG	2553-8
AB	BACKGROUND: To determine the relationship between DNA polymorphisms in the angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) gene, serum ACE activity and the risk of diabetic nephropathy. METHODS: A case-control study was carried out in a population of Jewish insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients. Cases (77 IDDM patients with diabetic nephropathy) and controls (89 IDDM patients with normoalbuminuria) were genotyped with PCR protocols for detecting two DNA polymorphisms in the ACE gene: one in intron 7 detected with the restriction enzyme PstI and the other in intron 16 identified as an insertion/deletion (I/D). RESULTS: The risk of nephropathy was increased only in patients homozygous for the allele with the PstI site. These homozygotes had a nephropathy risk that was 2.3 times (95% C.I.: 1.2-4.5) that of the other genotypes. Furthermore, these individuals did not have elevated serum ACE activity. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study are evidence that the risk of diabetic nephropathy in IDDM is influenced by genetic variability at the ACE locus, but the responsible variant is not the I/D polymorphism in intron 16. Our findings require further studies in other populations.

TI	Polymorphisms in angiotensin-converting enzyme gene and severity of renal disease in Henoch-Schoenlein patients. Italian Group of Renal Immunopathology.
PG	3184-8
AB	BACKGROUND: The influence of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene polymorphism on the progression of primary IgA nephropathy (pIgAN) is still debated. Even though the allele frequency was reported to be similar to controls, in some studies D/D patients had a faster decline of renal function and need of dialysis. Since Henoch-Schoenlein purpura (HSP) nephritis is considered a systemic vasculitis with renal lesions indistinguishable from pIgAN, we investigated the effect of the ACE polymorphism on presentation and progression of HSP IgAN. METHODS: We examined the insertion (I) and deletion (D) polymorphism in intron 16 of ACE gene by PCR amplification of genomic DNA of 82 patients (37 children), with biopsy-proven IgAN associated with HSP enrolled in a collaborative study. RESULTS: No significant association with clinical presentation at onset or with final outcome was found (functional impairment at outcome in 31.8%, D/D, 27.4%, I/D and 44% I/I, heavy proteinuria in 36.3% D/D, 21.6% I/D, and 11.1% I/I). Patients homozygous for the D allele had a greater number of extrarenal relapses (P=0.0028). No association was found between the ACE genotype and the presence of hypertension at onset and at the end of the follow-up. No difference was found between adults and children. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of HSP IgAN, no ACE I/D polymorphisms were found to be associated with progressive deterioration of renal function. Different genes possibly involved in vasculitis might more strictly modulate expression and evolution of HSP IgAN.

TI	Angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion polymorphism and prognosis of IgA nephropathy.
PG	115-21
AB	BACKGROUND/AIM: Well-known factors for a poor prognosis in IgA nephropathy (IgAN) are hypertension, proteinuria, and renal insufficiency at the time of diagnosis. Also hypertriglyceridemia and hyperuricemia seem to play a role in the progression of IgAN. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene I/D polymorphism has been associated with cardiovascular diseases and with progression of IgAN. We, therefore, investigated the contribution of ACE gene I/D polymorphism in the prognosis of IgAN and its association with the other risk factors affecting the prognosis. METHODS: A total of 168 patients with IgAN were followed up for 6-17 (median 11) years from renal biopsy with respect to progression of renal disease defined as elevation of serum creatinine above 125 microM (1.4 mg/dl) in men or 105 microM (1.2 mg/dl) in women and over 20% from the baseline level. In addition to serum creatinine, the urinary protein excretion was evaluated at the time of renal biopsy and at the assessment visit at the end of the follow-up period. RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 26 (15%) patients showed progression of renal disease. Patients with ACE genotype II had a more favorable course than those with genotypes ID or DD. Although there were no significant differences among the ACE genotypes with respect to proteinuria &gt; or =1 g/24 h at the time of renal biopsy, proteinuria &gt; or =1 g/24 h was more frequent in patients with genotypes ID or DD than in those with genotype II at the end of the follow-up period. No associations were found between hypertension, serum lipids or serum urate, and ACE genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that patients with ACE genotype II have a more favorable prognosis than those with genotypes ID/DD. Secondly, proteinuria (&gt; or =1 g/24 h) found in patients with genotype II at diagnosis may improve, while in patients with genotypes ID/DD it is a more constant feature.

TI	Genetic polymorphisms of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha and cardiovascular disease in hemodialysis patients.
PG	c104-11
AB	BACKGROUND: Hemodialysis patients are prone to ischemic events potentially aggravated by hypoxia. The key player in adaptation to hypoxia is hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1alpha). Therefore, we investigated the association of HIF-1alpha polymorphisms with ischemia/hypoxia-related events in hemodialysis patients. METHODS: Patients on maintenance hemodialysis were enrolled from 4 training hospitals in Korea. Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of HIF-1alpha were genotyped. The association of these SNP with hypoxia-related clinical outcomes (ischemic diseases and anemia) and cancer was analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 376 patients participated in the study. No significant difference in genotype distribution was found between subjects with and without the hypoxia-related events. Three sets of linkage disequilibrium blocks were made for haplotype analyses (rs2783778 and rs7148720 in 5' upstream region; rs7143164 and rs10873142; rs2301113, rs11549465 and rs2057482). Of these, the CT haplotype in the first set was associated with both acute myocardial infarction and frequent intradialytic hypotension (acute myocardial infarction: adjusted odds ratio = 0.15, 95% CI: 0.03-0.69; frequent intradialytic hypotension: adjusted odds ratio = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.12-0.72). CONCLUSION: Genetic polymorphisms of HIF-1alpha were associated with acute myocardial infarction and intradialytic hypotension in hemodialysis patients.

TI	Early growth and ageing.
PG	41-50; discussion 50-4
AB	Effects of in utero and early life conditions on adult health and disease such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes are well documented by epidemiological and clinical observations. Animal models including intrauterine artery ligation, maternal restriction of iron, protein or general caloric intake, provide invaluable tools to understand mechanisms linking early growth and later diseases in adult life. In addition, the rodent model of maternal protein restriction has revealed that longevity can be influenced either positively or negatively by early growth patterns. Recent rapid advances in the ageing field using model organisms involving caloric restriction and genetic mutation as well as gene overexpression demonstrated the importance of insulin/ IGF-1 signaling pathways, oxidative damage and SIRT1 in the regulation of lifespan. Studies using rodent models of maternal protein restriction suggest that alteration in insulin metabolism, changes in expression of antioxidant defense systems and in levels of oxidative damage (including telomere attrition) may also play a key role in regulation of lifespan by the early environment. It is suggested that neuroendocrine systems and epigenetic modification may be the potential mechanisms underlying beneficial or detrimental effects of early growth on the regulation of lifespan. Further studies in this area are warranted.

TI	Prader-Willi syndrome due to uniparental disomy in a patient with a balanced chromosomal translocation.
PG	579-85
AB	OBJECTIVES: In contrast to most human autosomal genes which are expressed biallelically, the expression of imprinted genes depends on the parental origin of the allele. Prader-Willi syndrome is a neurobehavioral disorder in which the expression of active paternal alleles of imprinted genes from chromosomal region 15q11-q13 is abolished by deletions, maternal uniparental disomy or imprinting defects. We report an unusual case of maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 15 due to a balanced translocation t(8;15)(q24.1;q21.2) leading to Prader-Willi syndrome in a 3-year-old girl. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cytogenetic investigation revealed a balanced translocation t(8;15)(q24.1;q21.2) in the patient and subsequently also in her unaffected mother. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis did not reveal any deletion of the PWS critical region, but methylation analysis of the SNRPN gene showed an abnormal methylation pattern indicating the absence of paternal chromosome 15. Microsatellite analysis of multiple loci and methylation-specific MLPA analysis confirmed maternal uniparental heterodisomy of chromosome 15 as the cause of PWS in the patient. CONCLUSIONS: This example emphasizes the importance of uniparental disomy testing in pregnancies of carriers of chromosomal aberrations with participation of chromosomes carrying imprinted genes involved in human diseases.

TI	TNF-alpha promoter single nucleotide polymorphisms in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.
PG	346-52
AB	Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) secrete biogenic amines, hormones and growth factors, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) being one of them. As the expression of TNF-alpha is mostly regulated at the transcriptional level, its promoter polymorphisms have been intensively studied as a potential determinant of TNF-alpha production and cancer susceptibility. We have analyzed for the first time the potential association between -238, -308, -857 and -1031 TNF-alpha promoter polymorphisms and GEP-NETs. The study included 65 individuals diagnosed with GEP-NET and 154 healthy age	and sex-matched controls. Although most of the patients had solitary GEP-NETs, 6 were diagnosed with GEP-NET as a part of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 and 1 as a part of neurofibromatosis type 1. The C allele at the -1031 position was more frequent in GEP-NET patients (p &lt; 0.0005), suggesting its possible role in GEP-NET development. The significant difference between foregut and midgut GEP-NET patients was observed in the -308 high expression genotypes and -308A allele (high expression) which tend to occur more frequently in the foregut GEP-NETs (p = 0.0392 and p = 0.0350, respectively). When functional and nonfunctional pancreatic endocrine tumors were compared, there were no significant differences in the researched TNF-alpha SNPs. The results suggest the putative role of TNF-alpha -1031 polymorphism in the development of GEP-NET.

TI	Role of MTHFR C677T polymorphism in ischemic stroke.
PG	48-50; discussion 51-2
AB	BACKGROUND: Homozygosity for MTHFR C677T polymorphism can lead to significantly high homocysteine levels and hyperhomocysteinemia is an important risk factor for thrombotic events. AIMS: The aim was to determine role of MTHFR C677T polymorphism in North Indians with ischemic stroke. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: In a prospective study, the subjects of stroke were recruited from the neurology clinic of the hospital. Controls were healthy individuals from the Hematology clinic without any history of stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plasma homocysteine levels were measured by enzyme immuno assay method after 3 months of acute episode. Serum folate and Vitamin B12 levels were estimated by competitive inhibition radioassay. MTHFR polymorphism was detected by PCR-RFLP using Hinf I enzyme. Statistical analysis: The analysis of significance of results was done using SPSS software package. A p-value. RESULTS: Thirty-two acute ischemic stroke patients (aged 1-44 years) were studied. Fourteen (43.8%) had recurrent stroke. Nine (28%) had multiple infarcts. Four of 32 patients (12.5%) had high homocysteine levels. Three out of these 4 hyper-homocysteinemia patients were homozygous ( TT ) for MTHFR polymorphism (2 with recurrent stroke). Two of three homozygous cases with TT genotype had low serum folate. Five of 32 stroke cases (18.8%) were heterozygous ( CT ) genotype. CONCLUSIONS: Primary hyper-homocysteinemia appears to be an important risk factor for ischemic stroke in North Indians, most due to MTHFR C677T homozygosity. Folate levels may modify the presentation of the MTHFR TT genotype.

TI	Phenotypic clustering of lamin A/C mutations in neuromuscular patients.
PG	1285-92
AB	BACKGROUND: Mutations in the LMNA gene, encoding human lamin A/C, have been associated with an increasing number of disorders often involving skeletal and cardiac muscle, but no clear genotype/phenotype correlation could be established to date. METHODS: We analyzed the LMNA gene in a large cohort of patients mainly affected by neuromuscular or cardiac disease and clustered mutated patients in two groups to unravel possible correlations. RESULTS: We identified 28 variants, 9 of which reported for the first time. The two groups of patients were characterized by clinical and genetic differences: 1) patients with childhood onset displayed skeletal muscle involvement with predominant scapuloperoneal and facial weakness associated with missense mutations; 2) patients with adult onset mainly showed cardiac disorders or myopathy with limb girdle distribution, often associated with frameshift mutations presumably leading to a truncated protein. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings, supported by meta-analysis of previous literature, suggest the presence of two different pathogenetic mechanisms: late onset phenotypes may arise through loss of function secondary to haploinsufficiency, while dominant negative or toxic gain of function mechanisms may explain the severity of early phenotypes. This model of patient stratification may help patient management and facilitate future studies aimed at deciphering lamin A/C pathogenesis.

TI	Germline and mosaic mutations of FLN1 in men with periventricular heterotopia.
PG	51-6
AB	OBJECTIVE: To describe the phenotypic spectrum and genetics of periventricular nodular heterotopia (PNH) caused by FLN1 mutations in four men. BACKGROUND: X-linked PNH caused by FLN1 mutations (MIM #300049) implies prenatal or early postnatal lethality in boys and 50% recurrence risk in daughters of affected women. METHODS: Clinical examination, cognitive testing, MRI, and mutation analysis (denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and direct sequencing) on blood lymphocytes and single hair roots were performed for nine affected individuals, including three men. Neuropathologic study of the brain was performed for an affected boy. RESULTS: In two families, missense mutations were transmitted from mother to son (Met102Val) and from father to daughter (Ser149Phe), causing mild phenotypes in both genders, including unilateral PNH. In a third family, a man was mosaic for an A&gt;G substitution (intron 11 acceptor splice site) on leukocyte DNA and hair roots (mutant = 42% and 69%). Single hair root analysis confirmed that the mutation was not present in all ectodermal derivative cells. A healthy daughter had inherited the X chromosome from her father's wild-type germinal cell population. In the fourth family, an eight-base deletion (AGGAGGTG, intron 25 donor splice site) led to early deaths of boys. Postmortem study in a newborn boy revealed PNH and cardiovascular, genitourinary, and gut malformations. CONCLUSIONS: Periventricular nodular heterotopia caused by FLN1 mutations in men has a wide clinical spectrum and is caused by different genetic mechanisms, including somatic mosaicism. Mutation analysis of FLN1 should support genetic counseling in men with periventricular nodular heterotopia.

TI	Clinical and genetic characterization of manifesting carriers of DMD mutations.
PG	499-504
AB	Manifesting carriers of DMD gene mutations may present diagnostic challenges, particularly in the absence of a family history of dystrophinopathy. We review the clinical and genetic features in 15 manifesting carriers identified among 860 subjects within the United Dystrophinopathy Project, a large clinical dystrophinopathy cohort whose members undergo comprehensive DMD mutation analysis. We defined manifesting carriers as females with significant weakness, excluding those with only myalgias/cramps. DNA extracted from peripheral blood was used to study X-chromosome inactivation patterns. Among these manifesting carriers, age at symptom onset ranged from 2 to 47 years. Seven had no family history and eight had male relatives with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Clinical severity among the manifesting carriers varied from a DMD-like progression to a very mild Becker muscular dystrophy-like phenotype. Eight had exonic deletions or duplications and six had point mutations. One patient had two mutations (an exonic deletion and a splice site mutation), consistent with a heterozygous compound state. The X-chromosome inactivation pattern was skewed toward non-random in four out of seven informative deletions or duplications but was random in all cases with nonsense mutations. We present the results of DMD mutation analysis in this manifesting carrier cohort, including the first example of a presumably compound heterozygous DMD mutation. Our results demonstrate that improved molecular diagnostic methods facilitate the identification of DMD mutations in manifesting carriers, and confirm the heterogeneity of mutational mechanisms as well as the wide spectrum of phenotypes.

TI	PPARG Pro12Ala genotype and risk of cognitive decline in elders? Maybe with diabetes.
PG	50-5
AB	The Pro12Ala polymorphism of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARG; NCBI dbSNP rs1801282) has been associated with preservation of cognitive function, decreased risk of diabetes, and increased risk of obesity. We attempted to replicate these associations, testing cognitive function and lifetime cognitive change in 519 participants who took the same cognitive test at ages 11 and 79 years. Scores were also available for other cognitive tests at age 79 years, along with history of diabetes, current Body Mass Index (BMI), and other disease and demographic variables. Pro12Ala carrier status was not directly associated with diabetes history or BMI. In carriers who contracted diabetes despite carrying the protective allele, cognitive decline as measured by one test was significantly greater than in other groups. Only six individuals fell into this group; the other cognitive tests did not show this effect. This sample did not replicate the direct association of the PPARG Pro12Ala allele with diabetes status or preserved cognitive function. The data did suggest that risk of cognitive decline is greater when Pro12Ala carriers contract diabetes.

TI	APOE, CETP and LPL genes show strong association with lipid levels in Greek children.
PG	26-33
AB	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Studies have consistently demonstrated that variants in a number of candidate genes are significant determinants of lipid levels in adults. However, few studies have investigated the impact of these variants in children. Therefore, in the present investigation we examined the influence of ten common variants in the genes for lipoprotein lipase (LPL-S447X), cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP-Taq1B) apolipoprotein (APO) E (epsilon2, epsilon3, epsilon4), APOA5 (-1131C&gt;T and S19W), APOA4 (S347T) and APOC3 (-482C&gt;T; 1100C&gt;T and 3238G&gt;C) on lipoprotein levels children from the Gene-Diet Attica Investigation on childhood obesity (GENDAI). METHODS AND RESULTS: The ten variants selected were genotyped in 882 Greek children, mean age: 11.2+/-0.7 years (418 females and 464 males). Genotypes were assessed using TaqMan technology. Significantly higher total cholesterol (TC) (p=0.0001) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (p&lt;0.0001) were observed in APOE epsilon4 carriers compared to epsilon3/epsilon3 homozygotes and epsilon2 carriers. The association of APOE genotype with TC and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio (p=0.0008) was further modulated by body mass index. Carriers of the CETP TaqIB B2 allele had significantly higher HDL-C (p&lt;0.0001) and significantly lower TC: HDL-C ratio (p&lt;0.0001) compared to B1/B1 individuals. No significant associations were observed between APOA4, APOA5 and APOC3 variants and serum lipids. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that these common variants are associated with lipid levels in this healthy paediatric cohort, suggesting that even in these young children there may be potential in predicting their lifelong exposure to an adverse lipid profile.

TI	Marabou 2005: nutrition and human development.
PG	S1-11; discussion S72-91
AB	Nutrition is now becoming once more of intense interest to biological and medical scientists working on the control of development and human health. It is also now of ever greater public health interest. Few scientists, however, recognize that the same interest for those involved in fundamental science and public health developed a century ago focusing on the way in which nutrition and specific micronutrients, as well as general energy and protein intakes, were crucial to infant growth and appropriate development. The discovery of vitamins was matched by the proposition that stunted children in poor communities in the Western world were suffering from poverty-related poor diets. The critical role of nutrition was established by feeding studies, which then led to major food and agricultural policy changes during the Second World War, when food supplies were scarce throughout Europe. The success of these wartime policies led to a revolution in governmental thinking and a cheap food policy, together with a major boost in national agricultural production as an issue of national security. Nutritionists transferred their scientific interest to the study of childhood malnutrition in the developing world. The promotion of intensive agriculture and the food industry led to a revolution in food supplies, with the intense promotion of meat, milk, butter, and sugar production and consumption. The resulting escalation in cardiovascular disease related to the dietary change slowly altered public health policies, but as cardiovascular deaths decreased in the developed world, obesity and diabetes progressively increased. Now the lower	and middle-income countries (i.e., the developing world) have far more cardiovascular disease as Western diets and cultural habits are imported. The remarkable escalation of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, particularly in populations currently and previously subjected to malnutrition, now reveals unusual susceptibility to these diseases. This susceptibility is increasingly related to the conjunction of fetal malnutrition and later inappropriate diets. The alarming escalation in the health burden suggests that two-thirds of the world's population is super-sensitive to weight gain, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and perhaps many cancers. New evidence on epigenetics and the structural changes in the fetus in response to inappropriate maternal diets provides mechanisms to explain this. Unfortunately, a vicious intergenerational cycle of maternal and fetal epigenetic change seems to herald markedly increased future burdens of disease. The nutrition field is therefore challenged not only in terms of science, but also in new dimensions of public health of immense economic significance.

TI	Insulin secretion in women who have polycystic ovary syndrome and carry the Gly972Arg variant of insulin receptor substrate-1 in response to a high-glycemic or low-glycemic carbohydrate load.
PG	905-10
AB	OBJECTIVE: We evaluated metabolic parameters in Chilean women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who were carriers and non-carriers of the glycine-to-arginine substitution at codon 972 (Gly972Arg) variant of insulin receptor substrate-1 and to assess insulin response after oral high	and low-glycemic loads METHODS: In 146 women with PCOS and 97 healthy women (HW), Gly972Arg genotypes were obtained by polymerase chain reaction, and an oral glucose tolerance test was performed with glucose and insulin measurements. An insulinogenic index, a homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance, and whole-body insulin sensitivity index (composite) were calculated. Eight carriers and eight non-carriers (four PCOS and four HW, respectively) underwent a 50-g glucose (high glycemic) or 50-g fructose (low glycemic) load with serum glucose and insulin measurements at 15-min intervals for 3 h. RESULTS: The frequency of the Gly972Arg variant was higher in PCOS patients than in HW (P &lt; 0.05). The insulinogenic index was lower in HW carriers than in non-carriers (P &lt; 0.05). In PCOS carriers, 2-h insulin was higher than in those without the mutation. In overweight PCOS carriers, the homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance was higher and the insulin sensitivity index was lower than in PCOS patients without the mutation. In HW carriers, a delay in the maximal response of insulin secretion was observed, with a decrease of 26.7% in insulin concentrations 30 to 60 min after the 50-g glucose load. Glucose concentrations increased by 19.7% between 60 and 120 min. Glucose concentrations between 0 and 120 min were 14.9% higher in PCOS carriers than in non-carriers after the 50-g glucose load. CONCLUSIONS: In HW, this polymorphism appears to be associated with a decrease in insulin secretion; in PCOS women, this polymorphism interacts with obesity to influence insulin resistance, thus contributing to the pathogenesis of the metabolic component of PCOS.

TI	VNTR polymorphism of the insulin gene and childhood overweight in a general population.
PG	499-504
AB	OBJECTIVE: The VNTR polymorphism 5' of the insulin gene has been related to obesity in a previous study on children with early onset of severe obesity. Our purpose was to analyze the association between this polymorphism and adiposity variability in an unselected population of children and adolescents in northern France. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: In 293 nuclear families from the Fleurbaix Laventie Ville Sante study, we genotyped the INS VNTR polymorphism in 431 children and adolescents (8 to 18 years of age) and their parents. Overweight was defined according to the international definition in both children and adults. A transmission disequilibrium test in families with an overweight offspring was performed. The prevalence of overweight was compared according to genotype. The effect of the genotype on BMI and waist circumference was tested with a linear regression model, adjusting for age, gender, and Tanner stage. RESULTS: There was an undertransmission of class III alleles from heterozygous parents to their overweight offspring (p &lt; 0.002). Overweight was associated with class I alleles in children and adolescents (12% I/I, I/III vs. 3% III/III; p &lt; 0.08). Those with a class III/III genotype had a 1 kg/m(2) lower mean BMI (p = 0.04) and 3 cm lower waist circumference (p = 0.02) than those bearing one or two class I alleles. No association of adiposity or obesity with class I alleles was found in parents. DISCUSSION: INS VNTR polymorphism seems to contribute to differences in adiposity level in the general population of children and adolescents.

TI	Role of the DGAT gene C79T single-nucleotide polymorphism in French obese subjects.
PG	1163-7
AB	Acyl-coenzyme A, diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT), is a key enzyme involved in adipose-cell triglyceride storage. A 79-bp T-to-C single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on the 3' region of the DGAT transcriptional site has been reported to increase promoter activity and is associated with higher BMI in Turkish women. To validate the possible role of this genetic variant in obesity, as well as the variant's possible cellular-functional significance, we performed an association study between the T79C change and several obesity-related phenotypes in 1357 obese French adults and children. The prevalence of the T79C SNP was similar between obese adults and children when each group was compared with the controls. (CC genotype carrier frequencies were 0.25 to 0.29 in the obese groups and 0.21 in controls; p &gt; 0.05.) In each of the obese adult and child groups studied, the T79C variant was not found to be associated with any of the obesity-related phenotypes tested. Although the T79C SNP of the DGAT gene was studied in several groups of white subjects, the association between this SNP and obesity-related phenotypes, previously described, was not confirmed in our population.

TI	The obesity epidemic: metabolic imprinting on genetically susceptible neural circuits.
PG	342-7
AB	The apparent obesity epidemic in the industrialized world is not explained completely by increased food intake or decreased energy expenditure. Once obesity develops in genetically predisposed individuals, their obese body weight is avidly defended against chronic caloric restriction. In animals genetically predisposed toward obesity, there are multiple abnormalities of neural function that prime them to become obese when dietary caloric density and quantity are raised. Once obesity is fully developed, these abnormalities largely disappear. This suggests that obesity might be the normal state for such individuals. Formation of new neural circuits involved in energy homeostasis might underlie the near permanence of the obese body weight. Such neural plasticity can occur during both nervous system development and in adult life. Maternal diabetes, obesity, and undernutrition have all been associated with obesity in the offspring of such mothers, especially in genetically predisposed individuals. Altered brain neural circuitry and function often accompanies such obesity. This enhanced obesity may then be passed on to subsequent generations in a feed-forward, upward spiral of increasing body weight across generations. Such findings suggest a form of &quot;metabolic imprinting&quot; upon genetically predisposed neural circuits involved in energy homeostasis. Centrally acting drugs used for obesity treatment lower the defended body weight and alter the function of neural pathways involved in energy homeostasis. But they generally have no permanent effect on body weight or neural function. Thus, early identification of obesity-prone mothers, infants, and adults and treatment of early obesity may be the only way to prevent the formation of permanent neural connections that promote and perpetuate obesity in genetically predisposed individuals.

TI	Report on the IASO Stock Conference 2006: early and lifelong environmental epigenomic programming of metabolic syndrome, obesity and type II diabetes.
PG	487-502
AB	Now that analysis of the organization of the human genome sequence is reaching completion, studies of the finely tuned chromatin epigenetic networks, DNA methylation and histone modifications, are required to determine how the same DNA sequence generates different cells, lineages and organs, i.e. the phenotype. Maternal nutrition, behaviour and metabolic disturbances as well as other environmental factors have been shown to have major effects on these epigenetic processes, potentially affecting the predisposition of offspring to obesity and related adult disorders. The March 2006 Stock Conference considered the latest evidence from studies in the field of obesity and other related areas that elucidate mechanisms by which the environment can modify gene expression and the resulting individual phenotype. Presentations included evaluation of the molecular basis of epigenetic memory and the nature of relevant sequence targets, windows of susceptibility, and maternal dietary and behavioural factors that determine epigenetic changes. Imprinted genes, age and tissue-related exposures, transgenerational and potential interventions were also discussed. In summary, it is clear that epigenetic alterations can no longer be ignored in evaluations of the causes of obesity and its associated disorders. There is a need for systematic large-scale epigenetic studies of obesity, employing appropriate strategies and techniques and appropriately chosen environmental factors in critical spatio-temporal windows.

TI	Lifestyle and socioeconomic-status modify the effects of ADRB2 and NOS3 on adiposity in European-American and African-American adolescents.
PG	595-603
AB	The aim of the study is to investigate the influence of and interaction between lifestyle behaviors (diet and physical activity (PA)) and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in obesity-candidate genes (ADRB2, APOB and NOS3) on general and central adiposity. Six-hundred-and-twenty-one European-American (EA) and African-American (AA) youths aged 13-19 years were classified by ethnicity (49% AA), gender (45% male), and socioeconomic status (SES). PA and dietary intake with up to seven 24-h recalls were reported for all subjects. Percent body fat (%BF) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (SAAT) by magnetic resonance imaging. Reported energy intake (EI) and vigorous PA (VPA) were negative predictors of %BF and SAAT. Carriers of the NOS3 Asp298 allele had higher %BF only in the presence of an adverse environment (low SES). Compared to the most common NOS3 haplotype, homozygotes for haplotype A-non4r-Asp had 6.1% higher %BF. Significant interactions were revealed between the ADRB2 Arg16Gly SNP and VPA on VAT, SAAT and waist circumference (WC) such that Gly16 homozygotes may benefit less from increased VPA to reduce their weight. Genetic susceptibility to increased general and central adiposity is dependent on several factors, such as SES and vigorous exercise. Improved understanding of the joint effect of genes and lifestyle on adiposity will offer new insights into obesity and may provide new avenues for personalized prevention and treatment.

TI	Lack of association of CD36 SNPs with early onset obesity: a meta-analysis in 9,973 European subjects.
PG	833-9
AB	A recent study suggested that four CD36 polymorphisms (namely rs3211867, rs3211883, rs3211908, and rs1527483) were associated with an increased risk of obesity, an increased BMI and percentage of body fat in European adolescents. We first attempted to confirm these results in three independent case-control genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data totaling 3,509 subjects of French and German origin, but we were unable to find any association of these variants with early onset obesity risk. We then genotyped the four CD36 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a large population-based study of 4,667 Finnish subjects and we did not replicate any of the recently reported associations with BMI. By combining all available data in a meta-analysis (N = 9,973), we found no evidence for an association of the reported four variants in CD36 with increased obesity risk or increased BMI (0.07 &lt;/= P values &lt;/= 0.93). Finally, we assessed the contribution of the full CD36 locus gene variation to obesity risk in 3,509 subjects and we did not detect any significant association with obesity after correction for multiple testing. In summary, we were unable to confirm the recently reported association of variants in CD36 with early onset obesity in populations of European ancestry.

TI	The influence of a high-fat dietary environment in the fetal period on postnatal metabolic and immune function.
PG	1688-94
AB	Few reports show whether a high-fat (HF) dietary environment in the fetal period affects immune function or the development of lifestyle-related disease at maturity. We examined the influence of an HF dietary environment in the fetal period on postnatal metabolic and immune function. A total of 16 pregnant mice were given control (CON) diet and 16 were given HF diet in the gestational period, from mating to delivery. After delivery lactating mice were given either CON or HF diet, resulting in four groups. After weaning, the offspring mice were given the same diet that their mothers received during lactation. HF dietary intake in the postnatal period increased fat pad weights, serum glucose, and leptin levels. An HF diet in the fetal period resulted in fewer splenic lymphocytes, a thinner thymic cortex, and impaired antigen-specific immune reactions. Furthermore, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha production and serum triglyceride levels were elevated in the fetal HF group. In addition, the HF-HF group showed a consistent decrease in ovalbumin (OVA)-specific IgG and elevation of IgE, associated with advanced fatty changes in the liver. Results from this study suggest that HF environment during the fetal period induces epigenetic propensity toward obesity and immunological burden in part due to increased adipose tissue mass, significant reduction in the number of immune cells and decreased activities of immune cells.

TI	A preliminary candidate genotype-intermediate phenotype study of satiation and gastric motor function in obesity.
PG	1201-11
AB	Stomach motility contributes significantly to fullness sensation while eating and cessation of food intake in humans. Genes controlling adrenergic and serotonergic mechanisms (ADRA2A, GNB3, and SLC6A4) affect gastric emptying (GE), volume (GV), and satiation. Fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO) is linked with satiety. Our aim was to examine the association of these candidate genes with stomach functions that signal postprandial fullness: GE, GV, and maximum tolerated volume (MTV). These biomarkers constitute a component of the intermediate phenotype of satiation. A total of 62 overweight or obese participants underwent genotyping of the candidate genes, and validated measurements of GE of solids and liquids by scintigraphy, fasting and postprandial change in GV by SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography), and MTV by nutrient drink test. These markers of satiation were compared for 38 genetic variants in ADRA2A, ADR2C, ADRB3, uncoupling protein (UCP)-2 and -3, GNB3, FTO, and SLC6A4 using a recessive model of inheritance. ADRA2A, ADR2C, UCP-3, GNB3, and FTO loci were significantly associated with the intermediate phenotype markers of satiation: ADR2C (Ins-Del322_325) with accelerated GE; GNB3 (rs1047776) with delayed GE; ADRA2A (rs491589 and rs553668) and GNB3 (rs2269355, rs10849527, and rs3759348) with decreased postprandial GV; ADRA2A (rs3750625) and GNB3 (rs4963517 and rs1129649) with increased postprandial GV; UCP-3 (rs1685356) with increased MTV, and FTO (rs9939609) decreased MTV. Genetic susceptibility to postprandial satiation can be identified through intermediate phenotype markers. With independent validation, these markers may guide patient selection of weight-loss therapies directed at gastric motor functions.

TI	Early detrimental metabolic outcomes of rs17300539-A allele of ADIPOQ gene despite higher adiponectinemia.
PG	1469-73
AB	Minor allele A of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 11391 G/A of ADIPOQ gene (rs17300539) has been consistently associated with higher adiponectin levels in adults and children. The aim of this study was to investigate the metabolic role of this variant in a large cohort of children of European origin. A total of 1,852 children from two general populations in Verona and in Fleurbaix-Laventie and from the Lille childhood obesity cohort, were genotyped and pooled together after checking for the absence of genetic heterogeneity for rs17300539 between Italian and French children. The genotype of rs17300539 was studied in relation to circulating adiponectin levels, BMI, fasting plasma glucose, fasting serum insulin (FSI), insulin resistance index (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA(IR))), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides. After adjustment for known confounders, rs17300539 GA+AA carriers had 1.6 microg/ml higher adiponectin levels (P = 6 x 10(-8)) than GG carriers. They also showed higher BMI (B = 0.97, P = 0.015) and higher prevalence of obesity (OR = 1.35 (1.06-1.85), P = 0.015) than GG carriers. Before adjusting for obesity status, GA+AA carriers had higher FSI (B = 1.10, P = 0.040) and higher HOMA(IR) (B = 0.31, P = 0.020) than GG carriers. After adjustment for obesity status, they did not differ from GG carriers for any metabolic parameter, either among obese or nonobese children. The rs17300539-A variant, though consistently associated with higher adiponectin levels, does not exert any appreciable protective metabolic effect in children, either in the presence or absence of obesity. In contrast, this SNP may increase the risk for childhood obesity and related insulin resistance.

TI	Single-nucleotide polymorphism of CD36 locus and obesity in European adolescents.
PG	1398-403
AB	CD36 is a membrane receptor with a wide variety of functions, including the regulation of energy metabolism, fat storage, and adipocyte differentiation. To assess the relationship between CD36 gene single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and obesity in adolescents, we evaluated the relationship between CD36 SNPs and the risk of obesity in a case-control study composed of 307 obese (age = 15.0 +/	1.1 years) and 339 normal-weight adolescents (age = 14.6 +/	1.1 years). To validate the results, we assessed the relation between the same SNPs and percentage of body fat (BF%) and BMI in 1,151 European adolescents (age = 14.8 +/	1.4 years). SNPs with a minor allele frequency &gt;0.10 were selected to tag CD36. Genotyping was performed on an Illumina system. Four SNPs (rs3211867, rs3211883, rs3211908, and rs1527483) were associated with increased risk of obesity in the case-control study (odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval)): 1.96 (1.26-3.04], P = 0.003; 1.73 (1.16-2.59), P = 0.007; 2.42 (1.47-4.01), P = 0.0005 and 1.95 (1.25-3.05), P = 0.003, respectively). The same four SNPs were associated with higher BMI (P &lt; 0.05) and BF% (P &lt; 0.04) in the validation study. Further analyses identified a haplotype (frequency: 0.05) carrying the minor allele of these SNPs as being associated with obesity (OR: 2.28; P = 0.0008) in the case-control study and with excess adiposity (i.e., higher BF% (P = 0.03) and BMI (P = 0.04)) in the validation study. Our data suggest that genetic variability at the CD36 gene locus could be associated with body weight variability in European adolescents but these findings require replication.

TI	ADIPOQ polymorphisms, monounsaturated fatty acids, and obesity risk: the GOLDN study.
PG	510-7
AB	Serum adiponectin levels have been positively associated with insulin sensitivity and are decreased in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. Genetic and environmental factors influence serum adiponectin and may contribute to risk of metabolic syndrome and T2D. Therefore, we investigated the effect of ADIPOQ single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), -11377C&gt;G and -11391G&gt;A, on metabolic-related traits, and their modulation by dietary fat in white Americans. Data were collected from 1,083 subjects participating in the Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network study. Mean serum adiponectin concentration was higher for carriers of the -11391A allele (P = 0.001) but lower for the -11377G allele carriers (P = 0.017). Moreover, we found a significant association with obesity traits for the -11391G&gt;A SNP. Carriers of the -11391A allele had significantly lower weight (P = 0.029), BMI (P = 0.019), waist (P = 0.003), and hip circumferences (P = 0.004) compared to noncarriers. Interestingly, the associations of the -11391G&gt;A with BMI and obesity risk were modified by monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) intake (P-interaction = 0.021 and 0.034 for BMI and obesity risk, respectively). In subjects with MUFA intake above the median (&gt; or =13% of energy intake), -11391A carriers had lower BMI (27.1 kg/m(2) for GA+AA vs. 29.1 kg/m(2) for GG, P = 0.002) and decreased obesity risk (odds ratio for -11391A = 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI); 0.28-0.96; P = 0.031). However, we did not detect genotype-related differences for BMI or obesity in subjects with MUFA intake &lt;13%. Our findings support a significant association between the -11391G&gt;A SNPs and obesity-related traits and the potential to moderate such effects using dietary modification.

TI	The Q121 variant of ENPP1 may protect from childhood overweight/obesity in the Italian population.
PG	202-6
AB	Ectonucleotide Pyrophosphatase Phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1) downregulates insulin signaling by inhibiting the insulin receptor's tyrosine-kinase. K121Q and other ENPP1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), IVS20delT-11 and A/G+1044TGA, have been previously associated with obesity in French children, and the risk haplotype QdelTG has also been associated with this condition in both French and German children. Our aim was to perform a case-control replication study in order to assess the possible association of childhood obesity and overweight with the above-mentioned ENPP1 SNPs, and with the QdelTG haplotype, in the Italian population. A total of 865 healthy Italian children were studied: 453 normal-weight, 243 overweight and 169 obese subjects. Genotyping was performed by Taq-Man or Light-Cycler Technology. The Q variant of K121Q showed a negative association with overweight-obesity under both additive (odds ratio (OR) = 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.57-0.97, P = 0.030) and recessive (OR = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.10-0.97, P = 0.035) modes of inheritance. The Z-score of BMI showed a significant decreasing trend from children K/K homozygous to K/Q heterozygous, and to Q/Q homozygous (0.45 vs. 0.28 vs. -0.19; P = 0.009), according to the additive model. The two other SNPs and the QdelTG haplotype did not exhibit any association with overweight/obesity. This is the first child-based study showing a protective role of the 121Q variant of ENPP1 against overweight/obesity.

TI	INS VNTR is not associated with childhood obesity in 1,023 families: a family-based study.
PG	1471-5
AB	Previous studies have described genetic associations of the insulin gene variable number tandem repeat (INS VNTR) variant with childhood obesity and associated phenotypes. We aimed to assess the contribution of INS VNTR genotypes to childhood obesity and variance of insulin resistance, insulin secretion, and birth weight using family-based design. Participants were either French or German whites. We used transmission disequilibrium tests (TDTs) for assessing binary traits and quantitative pedigree disequilibrium tests for assessing continuous traits. In contrast to previous findings, we did not observe any familial association with childhood obesity (T = 50%, P = 0.77) in the 1,023 families tested. In French obese children, INS VNTR did not associate with fasting insulin levels (P = 0.23) and class I allele showed only borderline association with increased insulin secretion index at 30 min (P = 0.03). INS VNTR did not associate with birth weight in obese children (P = 0.98) and TDT analyses in 350 French families with history of low birth weight (LBW) showed no association with this condition (P = 0.92). In summary, our study, the largest performed so far, does not support the previously reported associations between INS VNTR and childhood obesity, insulin resistance, or birth weight, and does not suggest any major role for this variant in modulating these traits.

TI	Epigenetic influences on food intake and physical activity level: review of animal studies.
PG	S51-4
AB	Epidemiological studies suggest that the perinatal environment can predispose human offspring to develop obesity and type 2 diabetes. Animal models provide a means of assessing the consequences of manipulating the perinatal environment in ways that cannot be done in humans. During the gestational period, maternal malnutrition, obesity, type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and psychological and pharmacological stressors can all promote, while early-onset exercise can ameliorate, offspring obesity and diabetes, especially in genetically predisposed offspring. Many of these perinatal manipulations are associated with reorganization of the central neural pathways which regulate food intake, energy expenditure, and storage in ways that enhance the development of obesity and diabetes in offspring. Both leptin and insulin have strong neurotrophic properties, so altered availability of either during the perinatal period can underlie some of these adverse developmental changes. Because perinatal manipulations can permanently alter the systems which regulate energy homeostasis, it behooves us to identify the responsible factors as a means of stemming the tide of the emerging worldwide obesity epidemic.

TI	Congenital cataracts in two siblings with Wolfram syndrome.
PG	227-9
AB	BACKGROUND: Wolfram syndrome is characterized by optic atrophy, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus and deafness. There are several other associated conditions reported in the literature, but congenital or early childhood cataracts are not among them. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Observational case series with confirmatory genetic analysis. RESULTS: A pair of siblings, followed over 17 years, who manifest congenital or early childhood cataracts, diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness. They are both compound heterozygotes for mutations (V415 deletion and A684V substitution) in the WFS1 gene. Their father has congenital sensorineural hearing loss and developed optic atrophy. He is heterozygous for A684V in WFS1. CONCLUSIONS: Wolfram syndrome should be in the differential diagnosis of genetic syndromes associated with congenital and early childhood cataracts. Here, we report on a mother who is a phenotypically normal carrier of an autosomal recessive Wolfram syndrome gene, and a father who has some of the findings of the syndrome and carries a single mutation that appears to be responsible for his hearing loss and optic atrophy. Their 2 children are compound heterozygotes and manifest the full Wolfram syndrome, in addition to cataracts.

TI	Neonatal diabetes mellitus: a disease linked to multiple mechanisms.
PG	12
AB	Transient (TNDM) and Permanent (PNDM) Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus are rare conditions occurring in 1:300,000-400,000 live births. TNDM infants develop diabetes in the first few weeks of life but go into remission in a few months, with possible relapse to a permanent diabetes state usually around adolescence or as adults. The pancreatic dysfunction in this condition may be maintained throughout life, with relapse initiated at times of metabolic stress such as puberty or pregnancy. In PNDM, insulin secretory failure occurs in the late fetal or early post-natal period and does not go into remission. Patients with TNDM are more likely to have intrauterine growth retardation and less likely to develop ketoacidosis than patients with PNDM. In TNDM, patients are younger at the diagnosis of diabetes and have lower initial insulin requirements. Considerable overlap occurs between the two groups, so that TNDM cannot be distinguished from PNDM based on clinical features. Very early onset diabetes mellitus seems to be unrelated to autoimmunity in most instances. A number of conditions are associated with PNDM, some of which have been elucidated at the molecular level. Among these, the very recently elucidated mutations in the KCNJ11 and ABCC8 genes, encoding the Kir6.2 and SUR1 subunit of the pancreatic KATP channel involved in regulation of insulin secretion, account for one third to half of the PNDM cases. Molecular analysis of chromosome 6 anomalies (found in more than 60% in TNDM), and the KCNJ11 and ABCC8 genes encoding Kir6.2 and SUR1, provides a tool to identify TNDM from PNDM in the neonatal period. This analysis also has potentially important therapeutic consequences leading to transfer some patients, those with mutations in KCNJ11 and ABCC8 genes, from insulin therapy to sulfonylureas. Recurrent diabetes is common in patients with &quot;transient&quot; neonatal diabetes mellitus and, consequently, prolonged follow-up is imperative. Realizing how difficult it is to take care of a child of this age with diabetes mellitus should prompt clinicians to transfer these children to specialized centers. Insulin therapy and high caloric intake are the basis of the treatment. Insulin pump may offer an interesting therapeutic tool in this age group in experienced hands.

TI	[Hormonal imprinting--the unforeseeable future].
PG	1323-30
AB	Hormonal imprinting takes place at the first encounter between the developing receptor and the target hormone, perinatally, causing life-long changes in the binding capacity of the receptor and the indexes influenced by it. Perinatal hormonal imprinting is absolutely needed for the maturation of receptor, however, at the same time, molecules similar to the target hormone (related hormones, synthetic drugs acting at receptor level, chemicals, environmental pollutants etc.) can cause faulty imprinting, also with (morphological, biochemical, receptorial, behavioral) consequences for life. Although imprinting is characteristic and inevitable perinatally, it can be provoked in any period of life in developing cells, especially at the weanling and adolescent age (late imprinting). There is no gene mutation during imprinting, however, the methylation pattern of the genes changes and that inherits epigenetically the imprinting, which is manifested in disposition to diseases or in diseases (e.g. tumor formation, metabolic syndrome). Imprinting is inherited between generations that could cause--in the present chemical world--evolutionary consequences. Thus, medicaments or preventive drugs, e.g. pregnancy protecting drugs or oral contraceptive pills should be given cautiously, especially in the critical periods, considering that consequences are manifested always after a long period (sometimes decades) or in the next generations.

TI	Effect of the peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma 3 gene on BMI in 1,210 school students from Morelos, Mexico.
PG	467-77
AB	Little research has been undertaken on risk factors for obesity in young people in Latin America, including Mexico, despite the fact that obesity constitutes the number one public health problem in Mexico. Our objective was to investigate the effect of the Peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor (PPAR)_3 gene on BMI measured among adolescents collected from a cohort study originally designed for epidemiological studies. METHODS: Blood samples and anthropometric measurements were collected from 1,210 out of 13,294 public school students of both sexes, aged 11-24 years in Morelos, Mexico. In this study, we genotyped 7 selected SNPs of the PPAR_ transcript variant 3 (including Pro12Ala) in a group of unrelated 717 males and 493 females (age range 11-24), including 3 SNPs located in the 5' untranslated region. These 7 SNPs were selected by the tagging algorithm implemented in the program haploview to scan the whole gene. We tested each of the 7 SNPs individually for association with the body mass index (BMI), and two SNPs (rs2938392 and rs1175542) revealed significant associations with BMI (p-value=0.008 and 0.029, respectively). The SNP rs2938392 is roughly 41.5 Kb from rs1801282 (Pro12Ala in PPAR_2). Furthermore, we examined the association between haplotypes built from 7 SNPs and BMI using a score statistic implemented in the program haplo.stats. While the permutation based global p-value was 0.544, one individual haplotype with a frequency of 0.279 gave a p-value of 0.089 (permutation based). However, when the analyses were conducted in males only, the permutation based global p-value was 0.055 and one individual haplotype with a frequency of 0.28 gave a significant p-value of 0.013.

TI	Phenotype in X chromosome rearrangements: pitfalls of X inactivation study.
PG	29-36
AB	OBJECTIVE: X inactivation pattern in X chromosome rearrangements usually favor the less unbalanced cells. It is correlated to a normal phenotype, small size or infertility. We studied the correlation between phenotype and X inactivation ratio in patients with X structural anomalies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: During the 1999-2005 period, 12 X chromosome rearrangements, including three prenatal cases, were diagnosed in the Laboratoire de Cytogenetique of Strasbourg. In seven cases, X inactivation ratio could be assessed by late replication or methylation assay. RESULTS: In three of seven cases (del Xp, dup Xp, t(X;A)), X inactivation ratio and phenotype were consistent. The four other cases showed discrepancies between phenotype and X inactivation pattern: mental retardation and dysmorphism in a case of balanced X-autosome translocation, schizophrenia and autism in two cases of XX maleness and MLS syndrome (microphthalmia with linear skin defects) in a case of Xp(21.3-pter) deletion. CONCLUSION: Discrepancies between X inactivation ratio and phenotype are not rare and can be due to gene disruption, position effect, complex microrearrangements, variable pattern of X inactivation in different tissues or fortuitous association. In this context, the prognostic value of X inactivation study in prenatal diagnosis will be discussed.

TI	Coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms of interleukin-1 gene cluster are not associated with Kawasaki disease in the Korean population.
PG	381-5
AB	This study aimed to examine whether coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (cSNPs) of the interleukin-1 gene cluster [interleukin-1-alpha (IL1alpha), IL1beta, IL-1-receptor antagonist (IL1RN)] are genetic markers of susceptibility to Kawasaki disease (KD) in the Korean population. The study enrolled 109 KD patients and 287 healthy control subjects. Four cSNPs [rs17561 (Ala114Ser) of IL1alpha, rs1143634 (Phe105Phe) of IL1beta, and rs419598 (Ala23Ala) and rs315952 (Ser96Ser) of IL1RN] were genotyped using the restriction fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) and direct sequencing. The KD patients were divided into two groups according to the presence of coronary artery lesions (CALs). For genetic analysis, SNPStats, HapAnalyzer, Helixtree, and SNPAnalyzer were used. The allele and genotype frequencies of the IL1 gene cluster polymorphisms in the KD patients had a pattern similar to that in the control subjects. Furthermore, no association was observed between four cSNPs of the IL1 gene cluster and the development of CALs in KD. These results suggest that the IL1 gene cluster may not be associated with susceptibility to KD and the development of CALs in the Korean population.

TI	Gene polymorphisms of TNF-alpha(-308), IL-10(-1082), IL-6(-174), and IL-1Ra(VNTR) related to susceptibility and severity of rheumatic heart disease.
PG	363-71
AB	Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is an inflammatory disease of the heart tissues caused by interactive immune, genetic, and environmental factors. The objective of this study is to test for the association of polymorphisms related to cytokine genes with susceptibility and severity of RHD among affected children from the Nile Delta region of Egypt. The study included 50 children with chronic RHD (29 males and 21 females), with a mean age of 12.2 years, in addition to 98 healthy unrelated controls. Cases were further classified on the basis of echocardiographic findings into those with only mitral valve disease (MVD) or multivalvular lesions (MVLs) and also as mild, moderate, or severe valve lesions. For all cases and controls, DNA was extracted and amplified using polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers for detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter regions of cytokine genes tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha(-308 )G/A, interleukin (IL)-10(-1082 )G/A, and IL-6(-174 )G/C as well as a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs) in intron 2 of the IL-1Ra gene. All cases showed a significantly higher frequency of homozygous genotypes of TNF-alpha(-308 )A/A [odds ratio (OR) = 5.7, p &lt; 0.001], IL-10(-1082) A/A (OR = 3.1, p &lt; 0.05), IL-10(-1082) G/G (OR = 5.2, p &lt; 0.05), and IL-1Ra A1/A1 (OR = 2.2, p &lt; 0.05). Cases with MVD showed higher frequencies of genotypes TNF-alpha(-308 )A/A, G/G; IL-10(-1082) G/G; and IL-1Ra(VNTR) A1/A1 (p &lt; 0.05). Cases with MVL showed a significantly higher frequency of homozygous A/A genotype of both TNF-alpha(-308 )(OR = 10.6, p &lt; 0.05) and IL-10(-1082) (OR = 5.2, p &lt; 0.05). The same was observed for cases with severe valve lesions. On the other hand, all studied groups showed significantly lower frequency of heterozygous genotypes of TNF-alpha(-308 )G/A, IL-10(-1082) G/A, and IL-1Ra(VNTR) A1/A2. No significant difference was found regarding the frequency of IL-6(-174 )G/C polymorphisms in total cases or subgroups compared to controls (p &gt; 0.05). Predisposition to RHD is influenced by genetic factors including cytokine gene polymorphisms, with possible susceptibility to severe disease with multivalvular affection among cases with composite polymorphism (TNF-alpha(-308 )A/A and IL-10(-1082) A/A) and (TNF-alpha(-308 )A/A and IL-10(-1082) G/G).

TI	Developmental origins of adult disease.
PG	449-66, Table of Contents
AB	Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) has been linked to development of type 2 diabetes in adulthood. Using a rat model, we tested the hypothesis that uteroplacental insufficiency disrupts the function of the electron transport chain in the fetal beta-cell and leads to a debilitating cascade of events. The net result is progressive loss of beta-cell function and eventual development of type 2 diabetes in the adult. Studies in the IUGR rat demonstrate that an abnormal intrauterine environment induces epigenetic modifications of key genes regulating beta-cell development; experiments directly link chromatin remodeling with suppression of transcription. Future research will be directed at elucidating the mechanisms underlying epigenetic modifications in offspring.

TI	Genotype-phenotype associations in patients with severe hyperinsulinism of infancy.
PG	25-34
AB	In hyperinsulinism of infancy (HI), unregulated insulin secretion causes hypoglycemia. Pancreatectomy may be required in severe cases, most of which result from a defect in the beta-cell KATP channel, encoded by ABCC8 and KCNJ11. Pancreatic histology may be classified as diffuse or focal disease (the latter associated with single paternal ABCC8 mutations), indicated by the presence of islet cell nuclear enlargement in areas of diffuse abnormality. We investigated genotype-phenotype associations in a heterogeneous Australian cohort. ABCC8 and KCNJ11 genes were sequenced and case histology was reviewed in 21 infants who had pancreatectomy. Ninety-eight control DNA samples were tested by single nucleotide polymorphism analysis. Eighteen ABCC8 mutations were identified, 10 novel. Eleven patients (4 compound heterozygote, 4 single mutation, 3 no mutation detected) had diffuse hyperinsulinism. Nine patients had focal hyperinsulinism (6 single paternal mutation, 2 single mutation of undetermined parental origin, 1 none found) with absence of islet cell nuclear enlargement outside the focal area, although centroacinar cell proliferation and/or nesidiodysplasia was present in 7 cases. Regeneration after near-total pancreatectomy was documented in 4 patients, with aggregates of endocrine tissue observed at subsequent operations in 3. Although the absence of enlarged islet cell nuclei is a useful discriminant of focal hyperinsulinism associated with a paternal ABCC8 mutation, further research is needed to understand the pathophysiology of other histological abnormalities in patients with HI, which may have implications for mechanisms of ductal and islet cell proliferation. Previous surgery should be taken into account when interpreting pancreatic histology.

TI	Maternally inherited mitochondrial cardiomyopathy associated with a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 3303 of mitochondrial DNA in the tRNA(Leu(UUR)) gene.
PG	78-85
AB	Disorders associated with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations are usually dominated by involvement of the nervous system and skeletal muscle (hence the term &quot;mitochondrial encephalomyopathies&quot;). However, considering the high dependence of the heart on oxidative metabolism, it is not surprising that myocardial dysfunction is often a prominent feature in these disorders, either as isolated cardiomyopathy or as part of a multisystem mitochondrial syndrome. We report an infant with a maternally inherited C-to-T transition at nucleotide 3303 of mtDNA in the tRNA(Leu(UUR)) gene; this is the second kindred with cardiomyopathy identified to have this mutation of mitochondrial DNA. A brief review of other mitochondrial DNA defects is also included.

TI	Genetic correlates of early accelerated infant growth associated with juvenile-onset type 1 diabetes.
LID	10.1111/j.1399-5448.2011.00813.x [doi]
AB	Kharagjitsingh AV, de Ridder MAJ, Alizadeh BZ, Veeze HJ, Bruining GJ, Roep BO, Koeleman BPC. Genetic correlates of early accelerated infant growth associated with juvenile-onset type 1diabetes. Objective: We previously showed that accelerated growth predisposing to development of childhood-onset type 1 diabetes (T1D) is restricted to the first year after birth. We assessed whether this phenomenon of increased early growth is associated with variants of two genes, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) and insulin variable number of tandem repeats (INS-VNTR), whose products are components of the growth axis. Patients and methods: Patients and their siblings were genotyped for the INS-VNTR and for an IGF1 microsatellite. We tested for difference in first year growth, i.e., increased weight standard deviation score (SDS), a reliable measure of especially first year growth, between carriers and non-carriers of these gene variants, using a repeated measurement and regression analysis. Results: In patients, growth did not differ between carriers and non-carriers of the INS-VNTR*III allele, while carriership of this allele in siblings was positively associated with increased first year growth. In both patients and siblings, non-carriership of the IGF1*194 allele was positively associated with growth. Birth size was not associated with either variant. Conclusions/discussion: Non-carriership of the IGF1*194 allele was positively associated with accelerated first year growth in both patients and siblings, independent of disease. This IGF1 variant may therefore contribute to increased first year growth, but cannot explain the association of first year growth with diabetes. An effect on growth of the INS-VNTR was detected in healthy siblings, but not in patients, suggesting that disease supersedes a growth effect of INS-VNTR.

TI	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma2 Pro12Ala polymorphism, cod liver oil and risk of type 1 diabetes.
PG	40-5
AB	OBJECTIVE: We have previously described an association between use of cod liver oil (a dietary n-3 fatty acid supplement) and reduced risk of type 1 diabetes. n-3 fatty acids are ligands for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARG), which has recently been implicated in the control of inflammation and possibly autoimmunity. We aimed to estimate the association between the common Pro12Ala polymorphism of PPARG2 and risk of type 1 diabetes, and to test whether there is gene-environment interaction with use of cod liver oil in the first year of life or gene-gene interaction with the established insulin gene (INS) and human leukocyte antigen DQ (HLA-DQ) genetic susceptibility loci. METHODS: We designed a population-based case-control study of childhood-onset type 1 diabetes in Norway with information on use of cod liver oil in the first year of life from questionnaires and PPARG2 genotype data for 483 cases and 1520 control subjects. We used logistic regression for analysis. RESULTS: The odds ratio for the PPARG2 Ala/Ala or Pro/Ala vs. Pro/Pro genotype and type 1 diabetes was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.69-1.13, p = 0.33). There was no significant interaction with cod liver oil in the first year of life [P (interaction) = 0.35] or with the INS polymorphism [P(interaction) = 0.42]. CONCLUSIONS: Although the association between PPARG2 and type 1 diabetes was not significant, the observed odds ratio was almost identical to that observed in two previous studies and can contribute to meta-analysis indicating a weak but significant association. Our hypothesized interaction between cod liver oil and PPARG2 in reducing type 1 diabetes risk was not supported.

TI	Polymorphisms of the TNF-alpha gene and risk of celiac disease in T1DM children.
PG	138-41
AB	BACKGROUND: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and celiac disease (CD) frequently occur together. Previous reports suggested that the (-308)A variant of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) gene is associated either with T1DM or with CD. The aim of our study was to determine whether (-308)A and (-238)A allelic variants of the TNF-alpha gene might have any impact on the risk of CD in T1DM children. METHODS: Three hundred and one T1DM children were enrolled to the study. The presence of CD was screened with IgA endomysial antibodies (EMA) test. Jejunal biopsy was performed to confirm CD. TNF-alpha-308 and -238 genetic variants were tested using the method of restriction fragment length polymorphism. RESULTS: The prevalence of CD in the enrolled diabetic children was 6.3% (19 out of 301 children). The frequency of the (-308)A TNF-alpha variant was similar in the CD and the non-CD groups, exceeding the Hungarian healthy reference value. The number of (-238)A allele carriers was higher in the CD (4/19) than in the non-CD group (17/277) (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our study is limited by the small number of CD patients. On the basis of our findings, carriers of TNF (-308)A allele do not seem to have an increased risk for CD in T1DM. The association between TNF-alpha(-238)A allele carrier state and CD requires further investigation.

TI	Angiotensin-converting enzyme gene polymorphism and lipid profiles in Kuwaiti children with type 1 diabetes.
PG	87-94
AB	METHODS: We studied angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene polymorphism and lipid profiles in Kuwaiti children with uncomplicated type 1 diabetes. A total of 125 children with type 1 diabetes were matched in a case-control study on age and gender to 125 non-diabetic children as controls. Serum lipids (total cholesterol, TC; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, HDL; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, LDL-c; triglycerides, TG; apolipoprotein A1 and B, apo A1 and B; lipoprotein(a), Lp(a)); and glycated hemoglobin, HbA1c were evaluated according to ACE genotypes. RESULTS: Genotype distributions were found to be similar in cases [ACE insertion/insertion (II) 9.6%, ACE insertion/deletion (ID) 38.4%, ACE deletion/deletion (DD) 52.0%], and controls (II 8.8%, ID 43.2%, DD 48.0%), and were characterized by higher frequencies of DD, ID, and lower frequencies of II. Diabetic children with DD genotype showed significantly higher levels of TC (p &lt; 0.01), HDL (p &lt; 0.001), and apo A1 (p &lt; 0.001) than controls. There was a higher proportion of diabetic children with family history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the DD genotype group (51.9%) than those with II genotype group (11.1%) (p &lt; 0.001). Also, there was a significant increase in the frequency of diabetic children with Lp(a) &gt; 30 mg/dL in children with a family history of CVD (p = 0.008). Lp(a) levels were correlated with HbA1c in the diabetic group (r = 0.239, p = 0.019), but when patients with poor glycemic control (HbA1c &gt; 9%) were excluded, the significant correlation disappeared (r = 0.127, p = 0.381). After adjusting confounding between variables, the logistic regression analysis showed that the two significantly related variables with the rise in Lp(a) were increasing TC level and poor glycemic control. CONCLUSIONS: In children with type 1 diabetes, the role of ACE polymorphism as a probable contributor to CVD seems to be partially mediated through other factors such as poor glycemic control, TC, and Lp(a) level. A longitudinal study is recommended with a larger number of patients in each ACE genotype group in order to assess such associations.

TI	A case of transient neonatal diabetes mellitus.
PG	930-1
AB	We present a case of an 8-day-old infant boy with transient neonatal diabetes mellitus who presented to our emergency department with profound dehydration, failure to thrive, and hyperglycemia. The initial ill appearance of the patient required attention to a broad differential diagnosis including cardiac, metabolic, endocrine, and infectious processes. Transient neonatal diabetes mellitus is one of several causes of severe hyperglycemia in the neonatal period and is caused by genetic imprinting at the 6q24 region. It requires specific genetic testing for diagnosis. This case illustrates initial management of and recommended laboratory testing in neonates presenting with possible transient neonatal diabetes mellitus.

TI	The 5'VNTR proinsulin gene (INS) polymorphism and the functional reserve of beta cells in the intravenous glucose tolerance test.
PG	5-9
AB	INTRODUCTION: Proinsulin 5'VNTR polymorphism determines susceptibility to type 1 diabetes (T1DM). The authors tested whether it affects intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) results. Aim of the study: To evaluate a possible relationship between 5'VNTR proinsulin gene (INS) polymorphism and glucose, insulin and C-peptide levels during IVGTT among siblings of children suffering from T1DM. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fourteen patients	siblings of children with type 1 diabetes, positive for at least one autoantibody, underwent IVGTT with glucose, insulin and C-peptide concentrations measurement. RESULTS: Mean age of patients equaled 10.71 +/	4.15 years. Eight individuals were homozygous for class I/I and six were class III/I heterozygotes. No significant differences in blood glucose levels during the IVGTT were observed (p=0.67). However, lower insulin (p=0.03) and C-peptide (p=0.01) levels were observed in I/I homozygotes in post-challenge timepoints. No significant differences were observed in baseline fasting insulin, glucose and C-peptide levels. CONCLUSIONS: The class III allele in the 5'VNTR promoter region of INS is associated with a greater functional reserve of beta cells in response to a direct hyperglycemic stimulus in individuals with a familial background of T1DM.

TI	Subacute methotrexate neurotoxicity and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in a 12-year-old with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T polymorphism: homocysteine-mediated methotrexate neurotoxicity via direct endothelial injury.
PG	46-52
AB	From as early as the 1970s methotrexate has been associated with disseminated necrotizing leukoencephalopathy and other neurotoxic sequelae. Yet, a clear mechanism for methotrexate-induced neurotoxicity has not been established. The authors describe the case of a 12-year-old male with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and a homozygous methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T mutation, who developed subacute methotrexate-induced toxicity and cerebral venous thrombosis after receiving intrathecal methotrexate. The role of homocysteine as a possible mediator in methotrexate-induced neurotoxicity via direct endothelial injury is discussed.

PG	217-26
AB	Epithelioid cell granulomas may be associated with several neoplasms. Lymphomas may mimic or are associated with epithelioid granulomas. In this article the authors report a child with granulomatous reaction in B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and intracardiac thrombosis. Although cancer alone is a risk factor for thromboembolism, thrombosis is a multifactorial disorder with both hereditary and acquired risk factors. This is the first reported case of intracardiac thrombosis with MTHFR A1298C and factor XIII V34L mutations together with granulomatous reaction in non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

TI	A systematic review and meta-analysis of tumor necrosis factor alpha-308 polymorphism and Kawasaki disease.
PG	527-32
LID	10.1111/j.1442-200X.2010.03105.x [doi]
AB	BACKGROUND: There have been genetic studies assessing the association between tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-308 and Kawasaki disease (KD) but the results have been conflicting due to lack of power. Therefore, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to increase the power for identifying the association between the TNF-alpha-308 polymorphism and KD. METHOD: Studies were identified from MEDLINE and EMBASE databases and were included if the subjects were children and the frequencies between TNF-alpha-308 and KD were reported. Data were pooled using a random effect model if heterogeneity between studies was present. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were identified however only six studies were included. The pooled prevalence of minor A allele was 5.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.1%-9.5%). Gene effect was assessed using per-allele and per-genotype approaches. The pooled odds ratio of G versus A with the random effect model was 1.13 (95%CI: 0.34-3.27). The genotype effects for GG versus GA+AA was estimated and the pooled odds ratio was 1.08 (95%CI: 0.42-2.92). CONCLUSION: This review suggests a trend of association between the TNF-alpha-308 G-allele and KD. However, the gene effects are heterogeneous and assessing sources of heterogeneity are limited. An updated meta-analysis is needed if more studies are published.

TI	Unique maternal deletion of 15q in a patient with some symptoms of Prader-Willi syndrome.
PG	541-5
AB	BACKGROUND: Human chromosome 15q11-q13 is a critical region for Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) and most of the genes are under the condition of imprinting mechanism. PWS results from the loss of expression of paternally expressed genes and AS of maternally expressed genes. In this study molecular studies about a patient with congenital anomalies and mental retardation are analyzed. METHODS: Highly polymorphic microsatellite markers were analyzed by PCR. These markers exist within 15q11-q13 and distal to 15q13. RESULTS: Only the maternal D15S986 locus within 15q11-q13 was deleted and other markers were biallelic. CONCLUSIONS: The result of maternal small region deletion in this patient is different from the typical PWS with paternal chromosome deletion and it suggests that nearby the deleted region there exists a gene (genes) which is not imprinted but needs biallelic expression.

TI	Effect of Trp64Arg mutation of the beta3-adrenergic receptor gene and C161T substitution of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma gene on obesity in Japanese children.
PG	135-41
AB	OBJECTIVE: Obesity is a multifactorial syndrome influenced by both genetic and behavioral factors. Trp64Arg mutation of the beta3-adrenergic receptor (AR) gene and C161T substitution of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma gene have been reported to be associated with obesity or lipid metabolism in adults. However, the effects of these mutations on children have not yet been clarified. For this reason, we studied the effects of Trp64Arg mutation of the beta3-AR gene and C161T substitution of the PPARgamma gene on obesity in Japanese children. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In order to determine the effects of Trp64Arg mutation of the beta3-AR gene and C161T substitution of the PPARgamma gene on obesity in children, 105 obese Japanese children were screened by the polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment-length polymorphism analysis. Plasma lipid, apolipo-protein (apo), glucose, insulin and leptin levels were also determined. RESULTS: Obese boys with Trp64Arg showed a higher obesity index and lower plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), apoA-I and apoA-II than those of them without the mutation. Obese boys with both mutations showed a higher plasma leptin level than those with only the beta3-AR gene mutation or PPARgamma gene mutation. No significant effect of these mutations was found in obese girls. CONCLUSION: All of these data suggest that Trp64Arg mutation of the beta3-AR gene might affect obesity and HDL metabolism in obese boys. In contrast, C161T mutation of the PPARgamma gene, by itself, is unlikely to influence obesity, lipid metabolism or plasma leptin levels.

TI	Inducible and endothelial constitutive nitric oxide synthase gene polymorphisms in Kawasaki disease.
PG	130-4
AB	BACKGROUND: Nitric oxide (NO) is secreted by immune and vascular endothelial cells, and appears to play important roles in the pathophysiology of Kawasaki disease (KD). Thus, genetic variations in NO synthase (NOS) genes may be involved in the development of coronary artery lesions (CAL) in KD. METHODS: The present study investigated the association of endothelial constitutive NOS (ecNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS) gene polymorphisms with the development of CAL in KD in a Japanese population. RESULTS: The genotype distributions of 27-bp tandem repeat polymorphism within intron 4 of ecNOS gene did not show any significant difference between controls and KD patients with or without CAL. In addition, there was no significant association between whole-allele distribution of iNOS gene promoter (penta-repeat CCTTT) polymorphism and KD with or without CAL. CONCLUSION: These results did not support any association of ecNOS and iNOS gene polymorphisms to the development of CAL in KD patients in a Japanese population.

TI	Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphism in Kawasaki disease.
PG	236-40
AB	BACKGROUND: A genetic aberration in the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene (677 C to T substitution) has been shown to result in reduced enzyme activity. The hypothesis tested in the present study was that a higher proportion of Kawasaki disease (KD) patients with coronary artery lesions (CAL) would have the T677 allele compared with patients without CAL and healthy subjects. METHODS: Genotypes for MTHFR were determined in 75 KD patients (male:female ratio 52:23) and 238 healthy subjects (male:female ratio, 110:128) by the polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism method. RESULTS: The results indicated that female KD patients had a significantly higher frequency of the TT genotype compared with female control subjects. In the female population, the frequency of the TT genotype in patients with initial coronary aneurysm was significantly lower than in patients without this manifestation. Analysis of the data for the male population showed that the frequency of the TT genotype in KD patients developing coronary stenosis, occlusion or myocardial infarction was higher than that in those without these manifestations, although the difference was statistically insignificant. CONCLUSIONS: The TT genotype may protect female KD patients against initial aneurysm formation and predispose male KD patients to severe coronary complications. Further large-scale studies may be required to confirm the contribution of homocysteine in the coronary sequelae of KD.

TI	Serum lipoproteins and apolipoprotein E in infants with congenital hypothyroidism.
PG	249-52
AB	BACKGROUND: Hypothyroid adults have a high risk of atherosclerosis, secondary to increased levels of various cholesterol fractions, particularly low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). We investigated the existence of a correlation between thyroid hormone deficiency and serum lipoproteins and a possible effect of different apolipoprotein E (apoE) phenotypes on lipoprotein levels in 75 infants with hypothyroidism. METHODS: Seventy-three of the 75 infants had congenital hypothyroidism. At the age of one month, prior to the initiation of thyroid hormone substitution therapy, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroid hormones and lipid profile parameters were determined. Subsequently, apoE phenotyping in all patients was performed by isoelectric focusing followed by immunoblotting. RESULTS: Significant negative correlations were identified between triiodothyronine (T3) and LDL-C and total cholesterol (TC) levels and between thyroxine (T4) and TC levels. There were no correlations between TSH and free (F)T4 and lipid profile parameters. Although infants carrying at least one E4 allele had higher LDL-C (as well as TC and triglyceride) levels than those carrying at least one E2 allele, these differences were not statistically significant. No significant differences in thyroid hormones were noted in E4 allele carriers in comparison with other patients. CONCLUSIONS: The observed lack of a significant correlation between thyroid hormones (except T3), apoE phenotypes and lipoprotein levels suggests that, early in infancy, other factors may play a more important role in determining lipoprotein levels.

TI	A novel splicing mutation in the V2 vasopressin receptor.
PG	43-9
AB	In order to elucidate the molecular basis and the clinical characteristics of X-linked recessive nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (CNDI) in a kindred of Danish descent, we performed direct sequencing of the arginine vasopressin receptor 2 (AVPR2) gene in five members of the family, as well as clinical investigations comprising a fluid deprivation test and a 1-deamino-8-D-arginine-vasopressin (dDAVP) infusion test in the study subject and his mother. We found a highly unusual, novel, de novo 1447A--&gt;C point mutation (gDNA), involving the invariable splice acceptor of the second intron of the gene in both the affected male (hemizygous) and his mother (heterozygous). This mutation is likely to cause aberrant splicing of the terminal intron of the gene, leading to a non-functional AVP receptor. The clinical studies were consistent with such a hypothesis, as the affected subject had a severe insensitivity to both the antidiuretic and the coagulation factors stimulatory actions of AVP and its analogue dDAVP. Direct sequencing of the AVPR2 is an accurate and rapid diagnostic tool for CNDI and early referral of patients for AVPR2 sequencing is therefore strongly suggested.

TI	Diagnostic profile of neonatal hypotonia: an 11-year study.
PG	32-7
AB	The profile of disorders presenting with neonatal hypotonia to the neonatal intensive care unit has not been studied previously. An 11-year retrospective cohort study of neonates, who were identified through computer database records and were admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit from January 1989 to December 1999 at the Montreal Children's Hospital (Montreal, Quebec), is presented. The final diagnoses, tests obtained, and outcome were determined from a structured review of the subject's hospital record. The database search generated 95 records, of which 50 neonates met the inclusion criteria. The hypotonia was classified as central in 33 patients (66%) and peripheral in 17 (34%). Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (n = 13), Prader-Willi syndrome (n = 6), myotonic dystrophy (n = 6), other muscle disorders (n = 6), chromosomal disorders (n = 4), and peripheral nerve disorders (n = 3) were the most common diagnoses. The genetic tests of highest yield were fluorescent in situ hybridization for Prader-Willi syndrome, DNA methylation studies for Prader-Willi syndrome, trinucleotide repeat testing for myotonic dystrophy, and karyotype analysis. A diagnostic approach is proposed based on the results.

TI	Evo-devo of infantile and childhood growth.
PG	2-7
AB	Human size is a tradeoff between the evolutionary advantages and disadvantages of being small or big. We now propose that adult size is determined to an important extent during transition from infancy to childhood. This transition is marked by a growth spurt. A delay in the transition has a lifelong impact on stature and is responsible for 44% of children with short stature in developed countries and many more in developing countries. Here, we present the data and theory of an evolutionary adaptive strategy of plasticity in the timing of transition from infancy into childhood to match the prevailing energy supply. We propose that humans have evolved to withstand energy crises by decreasing their body size, and that evolutionary short-term adaptations to energy crises trigger a predictive adaptive response that modify the transition into childhood, culminating in short stature.

TI	Meeting report on the 3rd International Congress on Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD).
PG	625-9
AB	Developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) focuses on the earliest stages of human development, and provides a novel paradigm to complement other strategies for lifelong prevention of common chronic health conditions. The 3 International Congress on DOHaD, held in 2005, retained the most popular features from the first two biannual Congresses, while adding a number of innovations, including increased emphasis on implications of DOHaD for the developing world; programs for trainees and young investigators; and new perspectives, including developmental plasticity, influences of social hierarchies, effects of prematurity, and populations in transition. Emerging areas of science included, first, the controversial role of infant weight gain in predicting adult obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Second, in the era of epidemic obesity, paying attention to the over-nourished fetus is as important as investigating the growth retarded one. Third, environmental toxins appear to have abroad range of long-lasting effects on the developing human. Fourth, epigenetic mechanisms could unite several strands of human and animal observations, and explain how genetically identical individuals raised in similar postnatal environments can nonetheless develop widely differing phenotypes. Improving the environment to which an individual is exposed during development may be as important as any other public health effort to enhance population health world wide.

TI	Developmental origins of beta-cell failure in type 2 diabetes: the role of epigenetic mechanisms.
PG	64R-67R
AB	Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) has been linked to later development of type 2 diabetes in adulthood. An abnormal metabolic intrauterine milieu affects the development of the fetus by permanently modifying gene expression of susceptible cells. Altered gene expression persists after birth, suggesting that an epigenetic mechanism may be responsible for changes in transcription. Uteroplacental insufficiency (IUGR) is associated with hypomethylation and hyperacetylation of genomic DNA in brain and liver of IUGR fetal and juvenile rats. These findings are associated with zinc deficiency that often accompanies fetal growth retardation. Studies in the IUGR rat also demonstrate that an abnormal intrauterine environment induces epigenetic modifications of key genes regulating beta-cell development and experiments directly link chromatin remodeling to suppression of transcription. Dietary protein restriction of pregnant rats causes fetal growth retardation and is associated with hypomethylation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and PPARgamma genes in liver of the offspring. It is postulated that these epigenetic changes result in the observed increase in gene expression of GR and PPARgamma. Future research will be directed at elucidating the mechanisms underlying epigenetic modifications in offspring.

TI	Possible synergic effect of angiotensin-I converting enzyme gene insertion/deletion polymorphism and angiotensin-II type-1 receptor 1166A/C gene polymorphism on ischemic heart disease in patients with Kawasaki disease.
PG	597-601
AB	ACE I/D and AT1R 1166A/C polymorphisms are considered to comprise individual risk factors for the development of coronary disease. We sought to demonstrate that the ACE I/D and AT1R 1166A/C polymorphisms affect coronary artery stenosis in patients with Kawasaki disease (KD). We examined 147 healthy controls and 281 Japanese children with KD. The patients were further divided into group N (n = 246, no ischemia) and group I (n = 35, severe coronary artery stenosis with myocardial ischemia), and we studied the genotype of ACE I/D and AT1R 1166A/C polymorphisms. We also examined ACE activity in patients with acute KD. We did not detect any prevalent genotypes of the ACE and AT1R polymorphisms between controls and KD patients. However, the prevalence of the D allele in the ACE polymorphism and of the C allele in the AT1R polymorphism tended to be higher in group I than in group N (odds ratios, 2.00 and 2.32, respectively). In addition, the presence of the D and/or C alleles significantly increased the relative risk of developing myocardial ischemia (odds ratio, 2.71; p = 0.038). During the convalescent phase of KD, ACE activity was increased despite significant attenuation during the acute phase. These results suggested that the renin-angiotensin system is associated with the formation of severe coronary artery stenosis and myocardial ischemia.

TI	Association of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor gene polymorphisms with coronary artery lesions of Kawasaki disease.
PG	953-9
AB	We analyzed the genetic polymorphisms of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors [Fms-related tyrosine kinase-1, kinase insert domain receptor (KDR)] in Japanese patients with Kawasaki disease (KD) and normal control subjects to examine whether these genes would contribute to the KD occurrence and/or the development of coronary artery lesion (CAL) in KD. We found that the frequency of G allele of VEGF g.-634 G&gt;C single-nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter region was significantly higher in KD patients with CAL than in those without CAL (p = 0.012) or control subjects (p = 0.021) because of a significantly higher frequency of the GG genotype in KD patients with CAL. In addition, the frequency of the A1 allele with 11 AC repeats of KDR g.+4422(AC)11-14 dinucleotide repeat polymorphism in intron 2 was significantly higher in KD patients with CAL than in those without CAL (p = 0.013) or control subjects (p = 0.040) as a result of a significantly higher frequency of the A1A1 genotype in KD with CAL patients. The multivariate analysis of clinical features and genotypes of the two polymorphisms showed that the A1A1 genotype of KDR g.+4422(AC)11-14 polymorphism was an independent risk factor for the development of CAL with the highest odds ratio among several clinical parameters (odds ratio 6.76; 95% confidence interval 1.05-43.48). Dual luciferase assay demonstrated that the A1 allele with KDR g.+4422(AC)11 repeats showed a weaker silencer function than the A2 allele with 12 AC repeats. These findings suggested that VEGF and its receptor, KDR, genes contributed to the development of CAL in KD patients.

TI	Tie2-Cre-induced inactivation of a conditional mutant Nf1 allele in mouse results in a myeloproliferative disorder that models juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.
PG	581-4
AB	Neurofibromatosis type one (NF1) is a common genetic disorder affecting 1:4000 births and is characterized by benign and malignant tumors. Children with NF1 are predisposed to juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. The Nf1 gene encodes neurofibromin, which can function as a Ras GTPase-activating protein. Neurofibromin deficiency in mice leads to mid-gestation lethality due to cardiovascular defects. We have previously shown that conditional inactivation of Nf1 using Tie2-Cre recapitulates the heart defects seen in Nf1(-/-) embryos. Tie2-Cre transgenic mice express Cre recombinase in all endothelial cells. Here, we show that Tie2-Cre-mediated deletion of Nf1 also leads to excision of Nf1 in the hematopoietic lineage. Surviving mice exhibit a myeloproliferative disorder similar to juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia seen in NF1 patients. These mice provide a useful model to study neurofibromin deficiency in hematopoiesis. Furthermore, defects in Tie2-Cre-expressing progenitors that result in heart and blood defects suggest that related heart and blood disorders in NF1 and other syndromes represent disorders of the hemangioblast.

TI	Favorable response of pediatric stem cell recipients to human protein C concentrate substitution for veno-occlusive disease.
PG	49-57
AB	Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 is known to be elevated in patients with hepatic VOD after intensive chemotherapy. To re-establish endogenous fibrinolysis and to inhibit thrombin formation, we used non-APC (zymogen) to normalize PAI-1 levels. As a consequence of thrombin formation inhibition and the consecutive inhibition of the coagulation cascade, this treatment is expected to reduce the elevated D-dimer level. Six pediatric stem cell recipients with moderate or severe VOD after busulfan or total body irradiation conditioning regimen are reported here who were therapy-refractory to defibrotide or rt-PA therapy. All patients had low levels of PC activity (16-39%). The administration of PC (60-240 IU/kg) led to a rapid and sustained rise in PC activity (target level &gt;80%) with near normalization of prothrombin and partial thromboplastin time in all patients. Elevated PAI-1 levels declined. Five of the six patients showed a good clinical response with prompt resolution of clinical, sonographic, and laboratory signs of hepatic blood flow obstruction, while one patient with severe VOD, as well as concomitant liver GVHD and CMV disease, had a slow but detectable response to PC therapy.

TI	Determination of genetic predisposition to patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants.
PG	1116-23
AB	OBJECTIVE: Patent ductus arteriosus is a common morbidity associated with preterm birth. The incidence of patent ductus arteriosus increases with decreasing gestational age to approximately 70% in infants born at 25 weeks' gestation. Our major goal was to determine if genetic risk factors play a role in patent ductus arteriosus seen in preterm infants. METHODOLOGY: We investigated whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms in genes that regulate smooth muscle contraction, xenobiotic detoxification, inflammation, and other processes are markers for persistent patency of ductus arteriosus. Initially, 377 single-nucleotide polymorphisms from 130 genes of interest were evaluated in DNA samples collected from 204 infants with a gestational age of &lt;32 weeks. A family-based association test was performed on genotyping data to evaluate overtransmission of alleles. RESULTS: P values of &lt;.01 were detected for genetic variations found in 7 genes. This prompted additional analysis with an additional set of 162 infants, focusing on the 7 markers with initial P values of &lt;.01, and 1 genetic variant in the angiotensin II type I receptor previously shown to be related to patent ductus arteriosus. Of the initial positive signals, single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the transcription factor AP-2 beta and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 1 genes remained significant. Additional haplotype analysis revealed genetic variations in prostacyclin synthase to be associated with patent ductus arteriosus. An angiotensin II type I receptor polymorphism previously reported to be associated with patent ductus arteriosus after prophylactic indomethacin administration was not associated with the presence of a patent ductus arteriosus in our population. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our data support a role for genetic variations in transcription factor AP-2 beta, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 1, and prostacyclin synthase in the persistent patency of the ductus arteriosus seen in preterm infants.

TI	Absence of the wild-type allele (192 base pairs) of a polymorphism in the promoter region of the IGF-I gene but not a polymorphism in the insulin gene variable number of tandem repeat locus is associated with accelerated weight gain in infancy.
PG	2374-9
AB	OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to investigate whether a polymorphism in the insulin-like growth factor I promoter gene (IGF-I, wild-type, 192 base pairs) and in the insulin gene (INS) variable number of tandem repeat locus influence birth weight and weight gain in infancy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We obtained genomic DNA from 768 children. Exclusion criteria were multiple births, gestational diabetes, maternal diabetes, gestational age &lt;37 weeks, &gt;42 weeks, or unclear, and any condition potentially influencing weight gain. SD scores were calculated and adjusted for gestational age and gender. A gain in SD scores for weight between birth and 1 year &gt;0.67 SD scores was defined as accelerated weight gain. Genotyping was performed by fragment length analysis (IGF-I) and by fragment length analysis after using a restriction enzyme-based assay (INS variable number tandem repeat). RESULTS: Accelerated weight gain was present in 205 of 768 children. IGF-I and INS variable number tandem repeat genotype were not associated with birth weight. The IGF-I 192-base pair allele was less frequent in children with accelerated weight gain and was shown to reduce the risk for accelerated weight gain in a logistic regression model. CONCLUSION: The IGF-I 192-base pair allele may reduce the risk for rapid weight gain in early infancy.

TI	Genetic polymorphisms of hemostasis genes and primary outcome of very low birth weight infants.
PG	683-9
AB	BACKGROUND: Recent investigations have reported an influence of thrombophilic mutations and antithrombotic risk factors with development of intraventricular hemorrhage. It was our objective for this study to investigate the impact of genetic polymorphisms of hemostasis genes on the primary outcome measures of sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, and periventricular leukomalacia in a large cohort of very low birth weight infants. METHODS: There were 586 very low birth weight infants enrolled prospectively in a multicenter trial between September 2003 and July 2005, and an additional 595 very low birth weight infants, who had been recruited in a previous prospective trial, were studied. DNA samples were taken by buccal swab, and genotypes of factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin G20210A mutation, the factor VII-323 del/ins polymorphism, and the factor XIII-Val34Leu polymorphisms were determined by polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme digestion. RESULTS: In contrast to data published previously, the frequency of intraventricular hemorrhage or periventricular leukomalacia was not significantly influenced by any of the genetic variants tested. Carriers of the factor XIII-Val34Leu polymorphism, however, had a higher sepsis rate and a longer period of hospital care compared with noncarriers. The factor VII-323 del/ins polymorphism was found to be a potential protective factor against bronchopulmonary dysplasia. CONCLUSIONS: We could not confirm previously reported associations of hemostasis gene variants and development of intraventricular hemorrhage in very low birth weight infants. To better understand gene-disease associations in very low birth weight infants, the prospective development of large-scale cohorts with well-defined phenotypes and corresponding DNA samples is essential.

TI	Transient but not permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus is associated with paternal uniparental isodisomy of chromosome 6.
PG	49-52
AB	OBJECTIVES: The factors determining the pathogenesis of transient and permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus are poorly characterized. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of chromosome 6 in the pathogenesis of neonatal diabetes mellitus and to detect differences between these 2 phenotypes. METHODS: Microsatellite markers (D6S334, D6S286, D6S310, D6S308, D6S292, D6S311, and D6S403) and human leukocyte antigen DQ alleles were examined using polymerase chain reaction and DNA fragment electrophoresis in 3 patients with transient and 3 patients with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus. Humoral markers of islet cell autoimmunity and clinical characteristics were analyzed in the 2 groups. RESULTS: A patient with transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TND) and macroglossia carrying paternal uniparental isodisomy (UPD) of chromosome 6 has been identified. The isodisomy affected the whole chromosome; no maternal chromosome 6 sequences were detected. The permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus cases and the other 2 cases with TND did not have UPD. None of the patients had high-risk type 1 diabetes human leukocyte antigen DQ alleles and most infants were negative for islet cell-specific autoantibodies indicating that none of the 2 forms of neonatal diabetes mellitus is likely to be of autoimmune origin. An association of TND and persistent granulocytopenia is described for the first time. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that transient and permanent forms of neonatal diabetes mellitus have different genetic background and represent different disease entities. TND is associated with UPD of chromosome 6 suggesting that an imprinted gene on chromosome 6 is responsible for this phenotype. It seems that 2 copies of the paternal allele are necessary for the development of TND; therefore, it is likely that overexpression of a putative gene located on chromosome 6 alters pancreatic beta-cell maturation and insulin secretion.

TI	Functional analysis of six Kir6.2 (KCNJ11) mutations causing neonatal diabetes.
PG	323-32
AB	ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels, composed of pore-forming Kir6.2 and regulatory sulphonylurea receptor (SUR) subunits, play an essential role in insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. Binding of ATP to Kir6.2 inhibits, whereas interaction of Mg-nucleotides with SUR, activates the channel. Heterozygous activating mutations in Kir6.2 (KCNJ11) are a common cause of neonatal diabetes (ND). We assessed the functional effects of six novel Kir6.2 mutations associated with ND: H46Y, N48D, E227K, E229K, E292G, and V252A. K(ATP) channels were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and the heterozygous state was simulated by coexpression of wild-type and mutant Kir6.2 with SUR1 (the beta cell type of SUR). All mutations reduced the sensitivity of the K(ATP) channel to inhibition by MgATP, and enhanced whole-cell K(ATP) currents. Two mutations (E227K, E229K) also enhanced the intrinsic open probability of the channel, thereby indirectly reducing the channel ATP sensitivity. The other four mutations lie close to the predicted ATP-binding site and thus may affect ATP binding. In pancreatic beta cells, an increase in the K(ATP) current is expected to reduce insulin secretion and thereby cause diabetes. None of the mutations substantially affected the sensitivity of the channel to inhibition by the sulphonylurea tolbutamide, suggesting patients carrying these mutations may respond to these drugs.

TI	Weight loss and body fat reduction under sibutramine therapy in obesity with the C825T polymorphism in the GNB3 gene.
PG	730-3
AB	The relationship between weight reduction after sibutramine treatment and a single nucleotide polymorphism, rs5443 (C825T), in the guanine nucleotide binding protein beta polypeptide 3 (GNB3) gene is currently inconsistent. In this study, we aimed to reassess whether the GNB3 rs5443 single nucleotide polymorphism could influence weight reduction and body composition change under sibutramine therapy in 131 obese Taiwanese patients. By comparing the sibutramine and placebo groups with analysis of covariance, our data showed a strong effect of sibutramine on weight reduction (7.4+/-1.4 vs. 3.4+/-1.2 kg; P&lt;0.001) and on body fat percentage loss (4.2+/-0.1 vs. 2.1+/-0.1%; P&lt;0.001) in the combined TT+TC carriers. In contrast, sibutramine caused no significant additional effect on weight loss (P = 0.078) or on body fat percentage loss (P = 0.441) in homozygous C allele carriers.

TI	Genetic predictors of glucocorticoid-induced hypertension in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
PG	507-14
AB	OBJECTIVE: Glucocorticoids are used universally in the remission induction therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). One of the adverse effects of glucocorticoids is hypertension. Our aim was to define the frequency of and clinical and genetic risk factors for steroid-induced hypertension. METHODS: We determined the genotypes for 203 candidate polymorphisms in genes previously linked to hypertension or to the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of antileukemic agents. Hypertension was defined according to the guidelines of the American Academy of Pediatrics; patients were evaluated during the 28-day period of prednisone at 40 mg/m2/day during remission induction of childhood ALL. RESULTS: Of the 602 children with newly diagnosed ALL who were normotensive pretherapy, 270 (45%) developed hypertension during remission induction. None of the putative risk factors (age, sex, race, white blood cell count, risk group, body mass index, or serum creatinine) was associated with hypertension. Among the polymorphisms genotyped, we identified eight genes (CNTNAP2, LEPR, CRHR1, NTAN1, SLC12A3, ALPL, BGLAP, and APOB) containing variants that were associated with hypertension (chi2 P values 0.002-0.048), several of which interact with the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. Polymorphisms in CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 were not associated with hypertension. CONCLUSION: Hypertension is common during ALL remission induction and is related to germline genetic variation.

TI	Perinatal environment and its influences on metabolic programming of offspring.
PG	560-6
AB	The intrauterine environment supports the development and health of offspring. Perturbations to this environment can have detrimental effects on the fetus that have persistent pathological consequences through adolescence and adulthood. The developmental origins of the health and disease concept, also known as the &quot;Barker Hypothesis&quot;, has been put forth to describe the increased incidence of chronic disease such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes in humans and animals exposed to a less than ideal intrauterine environment. Maternal infection, poor or excess nutrition, and stressful events can negatively influence the development of different cell types, tissues and organ systems ultimately predisposing the organism to pathological conditions. Although there are a variety of conditions associated to exposure to altered intrauterine environments, the focus of this review will be on the consequences of stress and high fat diet during the pre	and perinatal periods and associated outcomes related to obesity and other metabolic conditions. We further discuss possible neuroendocrine and epigenetic mechanisms responsible for the metabolic programming of offspring. The paper represents an invited review by a symposium, award winner or keynote speaker at the Society for the Study of Ingestive Behavior [SSIB] Annual Meeting in Portland, July 2009.

TI	Heterogeneity of class I INS VNTR allele association with insulin secretion in obese children.
PG	480-4
AB	On the basis of the near-complete linkage disequilibrium of the insulin variable number of tandem repeats (INS VNTR) allele with the neighboring -23Hph1 A/T single-nucleotide polymorphism, previous studies have documented the association of class I (&quot;short&quot;) and class III (&quot;long&quot;) INS VNTR alleles with metabolic parameters, including circulating insulin levels. Using a new method to sequence class I alleles, we revisited this association in 346 obese children. Class I alleles are made of several types of repeats, whose repartition determines subclasses IC and ID. Fasting insulin was found to be higher in obese children with ID/ID genotypes (135 +/	12 pmol/l, n = 64) than with ID/IC or IC/IC genotypes (91 +/	5 pmol/l, n = 97, P = 0.0005). In response to oral glucose, peak insulin levels and insulin-to-glucose area under the curve ratios were higher in ID/ID (872 +/	122 pmol/l and 109 +/	15, respectively) than in ID/IC or IC/IC patients (586 +/	42 pmol/l and 76 +/	5, P = 0.02 and P = 0.04, respectively). Fasting and postglucose insulin levels were comparable in carriers of IC and of class III alleles. Our results support that the molecular structure of the VNTR allele, not only its overall length, is associated with variations of insulin secretion. ID/ID homozygosity appears responsible for the increased insulin levels previously attributed to the whole class I VNTR group. It will be important to test the ramifications of this observation for class I association with Type 1 (susceptibility) and Type 2 diabetes (protection).

TI	Association of Kir6.2 and INS VNTR variants with glucose homeostasis in young obese.
PG	398-401
AB	Although insulin secretion is commonly increased and glucose tolerance decreased in young obese patients, there is a wide individual variability of these parameters. We investigated whether common variants at the Kir6.2 (KCNJ11) and insulin variable number of tandem repeat (INS VNTR) loci are associated with insulin or glucose levels in 388 obese children. The E23K and INS VNTR alleles showed no significant association when each locus was examined individually but a clear effect when the two loci were combined for analysis. In obese children with Kir6.2 KK and class III VNTR alleles, fasting glucose was slightly but consistently greater (4.76 +/	0.05 mM) than in those with Kir6.2 EE and class I/I VNTR alleles (4.63 +/	0.06 mM, P = 6.10(-4)) or other genotypes (4.64 +/	0.03 mM, P = 1.10(-3)). Obese children with KK and class III VNTR genotypes also had an early response to oral glucose diminished by approximately 36% [insulinogenic index (IGI) = 50 +/	4] compared with Kir6.2 EE and class I/I (IGI = 78 +/	7, P = 0.026) or other genotypes (IGI = 69 +/	3, P = 0.001). In young European obese, the polymorphisms of Kir6.2 and INS VNTR are thus associated with a trend for lower insulin and higher glucose levels, which may reveal a possible epistatic genetic effect that may influence a prediabetic trait in young obese children.

TI	INS VNTR is a QTL for the insulin response to oral glucose in obese children.
PG	309-13
AB	We performed a genotype-phenotype association study to examine whether the insulin VNTR (INS VNTR) polymorphism located in the insulin gene promoter was associated with changes in insulin response to oral glucose. Two classes of INS VNTR alleles are observed in Caucasians, the &quot;short&quot; class I and the &quot;long&quot; class III. Plasma insulin and glucose concentrations and indices of insulin secretion (IGI) and sensitivity (ISI) were measured using an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in 387 obese children aged 12 +/	0.1 yr with a mean body mass index (BMI) of 30.6 kg/m(2) (161% of the normal mean). During OGTT, plasma insulin and IGI were 20-30% higher in I/I obese children vs. III carriers (P &lt; 0.01). A general linear model adjusting for age, sex, and puberty was also used to evaluate the influence of the VNTR genotype on the BMI-IGI (P = 0.07) and the BMI-ISI (P &lt; 0.006) relationships. The INS VNTR can therefore be considered a quantitative trait locus influencing glucose-stimulated insulin physiology in obese juveniles.

TI	Evolution of genomic imprinting with biparental care: implications for Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes.
PG	e208
AB	The term &quot;imprinted gene&quot; refers to genes whose expression is conditioned by their parental origin. Among theories to unravel the evolution of genomic imprinting, the kinship theory prevails as the most widely accepted, because it sheds light on many aspects of the biology of imprinted genes. While most assumptions underlying this theory have not escaped scrutiny, one remains overlooked: mothers are the only source of parental investment in mammals. But, is it reasonable to assume that fathers' contribution of resources is negligible? It is not in some key mammalian orders including humans. In this research, I generalize the kinship theory of genomic imprinting beyond maternal contribution only. In addition to deriving new conditions for the evolution of imprinting, I have found that the same gene may show the opposite pattern of expression when the investment of one parent relative to the investment of the other changes; the reversion, interestingly, does not require that fathers contribute more resources than mothers. This exciting outcome underscores the intimate connection between the kinship theory and the social structure of the organism considered. Finally, the insight gained from my model enabled me to explain the clinical phenotype of Prader-Willi syndrome. This syndrome is caused by the paternal inheritance of a deletion of the PWS/AS cluster of imprinted genes in human Chromosome 15. As such, children suffering from this syndrome exhibit a striking biphasic phenotype characterized by poor sucking and reduced weight before weaning but by voracious appetite and obesity after weaning. Interest in providing an evolutionary explanation to such phenotype is 2-fold. On the one hand, the kinship theory has been doubted as being able to explain the symptoms of patients with Prader-Willi. On the other hand, the post-weaning symptoms remain as one of the primary concern of pediatricians treating children with Prader-Willi. In this research, I reconcile the clinical phenotype of Prader-Willi syndrome with the kinship theory, contending that paternal investment relative to maternal investment increases after weaning. I also propose a genetic composition of the PWS/AS cluster, discuss the effects of new types of mutations, and contemplate the potential side effects of reactivating silent genes for medical purposes.

TI	Longitudinal genome-wide association of cardiovascular disease risk factors in the Bogalusa heart study.
LID	e1001094 [pii]
AB	Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. Recent genome-wide association (GWA) studies have pinpointed many loci associated with CVD risk factors in adults. It is unclear, however, if these loci predict trait levels at all ages, if they are associated with how a trait develops over time, or if they could be used to screen individuals who are pre-symptomatic to provide the opportunity for preventive measures before disease onset. We completed a genome-wide association study on participants in the longitudinal Bogalusa Heart Study (BHS) and have characterized the association between genetic factors and the development of CVD risk factors from childhood to adulthood. We report 7 genome-wide significant associations involving CVD risk factors, two of which have been previously reported. Top regions were tested for replication in the Young Finns Study (YF) and two associations strongly replicated: rs247616 in CETP with HDL levels (combined P = 9.7 x 10(-24)), and rs445925 at APOE with LDL levels (combined P = 8.7 x 10(-19)). We show that SNPs previously identified in adult cross-sectional studies tend to show age-independent effects in the BHS with effect sizes consistent with previous reports. Previously identified variants were associated with adult trait levels above and beyond those seen in childhood; however, variants with time-dependent effects were also promising predictors. This is the first GWA study to evaluate the role of common genetic variants in the development of CVD risk factors in children as they advance through adulthood and highlights the utility of using longitudinal studies to identify genetic predictors of adult traits in children.

TI	Genetic prediction of future type 2 diabetes.
PG	e345
AB	BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a multifactorial disease in which environmental triggers interact with genetic variants in the predisposition to the disease. A number of common variants have been associated with T2D but our knowledge of their ability to predict T2D prospectively is limited. METHODS AND FINDINGS: By using a Cox proportional hazard model, common variants in the PPARG (P12A), CAPN10 (SNP43 and 44), KCNJ11 (E23K), UCP2 (-866G&gt;A), and IRS1 (G972R) genes were studied for their ability to predict T2D in 2,293 individuals participating in the Botnia study in Finland. After a median follow-up of 6 y, 132 (6%) persons developed T2D. The hazard ratio for risk of developing T2D was 1.7 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-2.7) for the PPARG PP genotype, 1.5 (95% CI 1.0-2.2) for the CAPN10 SNP44 TT genotype, and 2.6 (95% CI 1.5-4.5) for the combination of PPARG and CAPN10 risk genotypes. In individuals with fasting plasma glucose &gt; or = 5.6 mmol/l and body mass index &gt; or = 30 kg/m(2), the hazard ratio increased to 21.2 (95% CI 8.7-51.4) for the combination of the PPARG PP and CAPN10 SNP43/44 GG/TT genotypes as compared to those with the low-risk genotypes with normal fasting plasma glucose and body mass index &lt; 30 kg/m(2). CONCLUSION: We demonstrate in a large prospective study that variants in the PPARG and CAPN10 genes predict future T2D. Genetic testing might become a future approach to identify individuals at risk of developing T2D.

TI	Offspring of mothers fed a high fat diet display hepatic cell cycle inhibition and associated changes in gene expression and DNA methylation.
PG	e21662
AB	The association between an adverse early life environment and increased susceptibility to later-life metabolic disorders such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease is described by the developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis. Employing a rat model of maternal high fat (MHF) nutrition, we recently reported that offspring born to MHF mothers are small at birth and develop a postnatal phenotype that closely resembles that of the human metabolic syndrome. Livers of offspring born to MHF mothers also display a fatty phenotype reflecting hepatic steatosis and characteristics of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In the present study we hypothesised that a MHF diet leads to altered regulation of liver development in offspring; a derangement that may be detectable during early postnatal life. Livers were collected at postnatal days 2 (P2) and 27 (P27) from male offspring of control and MHF mothers (n = 8 per group). Cell cycle dynamics, measured by flow cytometry, revealed significant G0/G1 arrest in the livers of P2 offspring born to MHF mothers, associated with an increased expression of the hepatic cell cycle inhibitor Cdkn1a. In P2 livers, Cdkn1a was hypomethylated at specific CpG dinucleotides and first exon in offspring of MHF mothers and was shown to correlate with a demonstrable increase in mRNA expression levels. These modifications at P2 preceded observable reductions in liver weight and liverratiobrain weight ratio at P27, but there were no persistent changes in cell cycle dynamics or DNA methylation in MHF offspring at this time. Since Cdkn1a up-regulation has been associated with hepatocyte growth in pathologic states, our data may be suggestive of early hepatic dysfunction in neonates born to high fat fed mothers. It is likely that these offspring are predisposed to long-term hepatic dysfunction.

TI	Molecular diagnosis of neonatal diabetes mellitus using next-generation sequencing of the whole exome.
PG	e13630
AB	BACKGROUND: Accurate molecular diagnosis of monogenic non-autoimmune neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) is critical for patient care, as patients carrying a mutation in KCNJ11 or ABCC8 can be treated by oral sulfonylurea drugs instead of insulin therapy. This diagnosis is currently based on Sanger sequencing of at least 42 PCR fragments from the KCNJ11, ABCC8, and INS genes. Here, we assessed the feasibility of using the next-generation whole exome sequencing (WES) for the NDM molecular diagnosis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We carried out WES for a patient presenting with permanent NDM, for whom mutations in KCNJ11, ABCC8 and INS and abnormalities in chromosome 6q24 had been previously excluded. A solution hybridization selection was performed to generate WES in 76 bp paired-end reads, by using two channels of the sequencing instrument. WES quality was assessed using a high-resolution oligonucleotide whole-genome genotyping array. From our WES with high-quality reads, we identified a novel non-synonymous mutation in ABCC8 (c.1455G&gt;C/p.Q485H), despite a previous negative sequencing of this gene. This mutation, confirmed by Sanger sequencing, was not present in 348 controls and in the patient's mother, father and young brother, all of whom are normoglycemic. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: WES identified a novel de novo ABCC8 mutation in a NDM patient. Compared to the current Sanger protocol, WES is a comprehensive, cost-efficient and rapid method to identify mutations in NDM patients. We suggest WES as a near future tool of choice for further molecular diagnosis of NDM cases, negative for chr6q24, KCNJ11 and INS abnormalities.

TI	Cytosine methylation dysregulation in neonates following intrauterine growth restriction.
PG	e8887
AB	BACKGROUND: Perturbations of the intrauterine environment can affect fetal development during critical periods of plasticity, and can increase susceptibility to a number of age-related diseases (e.g., type 2 diabetes mellitus; T2DM), manifesting as late as decades later. We hypothesized that this biological memory is mediated by permanent alterations of the epigenome in stem cell populations, and focused our studies specifically on DNA methylation in CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from cord blood from neonates with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and control subjects. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Our epigenomic assays utilized a two-stage design involving genome-wide discovery followed by quantitative, single-locus validation. We found that changes in cytosine methylation occur in response to IUGR of moderate degree and involving a restricted number of loci. We also identify specific loci that are targeted for dysregulation of DNA methylation, in particular the hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4A) gene, a well-known diabetes candidate gene not previously associated with growth restriction in utero, and other loci encoding HNF4A-interacting proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Our results give insights into the potential contribution of epigenomic dysregulation in mediating the long-term consequences of IUGR, and demonstrate the value of this approach to studies of the fetal origin of adult disease.

TI	Glucocorticoid effects on the programming of AT1b angiotensin receptor gene methylation and expression in the rat.
PG	e9237
AB	Adverse events in pregnancy may 'programme' offspring for the later development of cardiovascular disease and hypertension. Previously, using a rodent model of programmed hypertension we have demonstrated the role of the renin-angiotensin system in this process. More recently we showed that a maternal low protein diet resulted in undermethylation of the At1b angiotensin receptor promoter and the early overexpression of this gene in the adrenal of offspring. Here, we investigate the hypothesis that maternal glucocorticoid modulates this effect on fetal DNA methylation and gene expression. We investigated whether treatment of rat dams with the 11beta-hydroxylase inhibitor metyrapone, could prevent the epigenetic and gene expression changes we observed. Offspring of mothers subjected to a low protein diet in pregnancy showed reduced adrenal Agtr1b methylation and increased adrenal gene expression as we observed previously. Treatment of mothers with metyrapone for the first 14 days of pregnancy reversed these changes and prevented the appearance of hypertension in the offspring at 4 weeks of age. As a control for non-specific effects of programmed hypertension we studied offspring of mothers treated with dexamethasone from day 15 of pregnancy and showed that, whilst they had raised blood pressure, they failed to show any evidence of Agtr1b methylation or increase in gene expression. We conclude that maternal glucocorticoid in early pregnancy may induce changes in methylation and expression of the Agtr1b gene as these are clearly reversed by an 11 beta-hydroxylase inhibitor. However in later pregnancy a converse effect with dexamethasone could not be demonstrated and this may reflect either an alternative mechanism of this glucocorticoid or a stage-specific influence.

TI	Transcriptional profiling of rats subjected to gestational undernourishment: implications for the developmental variations in metabolic traits.
PG	e7271
AB	A link has been established between prenatal nutrition and the development of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases later in life, a process referred to as developmental programming. It has been suggested that the trajectory of development is shifted by alterations in the maternal nutritional state leading to changes in developmental plasticity, in part underpinned by epigenetic changes in gene regulation. However, to date, only candidate gene approaches have been used to assess expression and molecular changes in the offspring of maternally undernourished animals. Furthermore, most work has focused on animals at an age where the programmed phenotype is already manifest and little is known about changes in gene expression in the offspring prior to development of obesity and related metabolic disorders. Gene expression profiles of liver, retroperitoneal white adipose fat, and biceps femoris skeletal muscle tissue from young adult male rats (55 days old) in which nutritional status had been manipulated in utero by maternal undernutrition (UN) were compared to the profiles of offspring of ad libitum fed mothers serving as the control group (AD) (8 offspring/group). The expression profiles were determined using the Illumina RatRef-12 BeadChip. No significant changes in expression were identified for skeletal muscle or white adipose tissue. However, studies of liver tissue showed 249 differentially expressed genes (143 up regulated, 106 down regulated). Although the animals at day 55 have yet to develop obesity they already show biochemical abnormalities and by day 110 express a phenotype characterized by increased adiposity and altered insulin sensitivity. An analysis of pathways affected suggests that intrauterine programming of UN animals to favor fat as an energy source results in mitochondrial dysfunction which initially affects the postnatal hepatic function and subsequently, via the resultant metabolic changes in other organs leads to the evolution of a phenotype similar to that of the metabolic syndrome.

TI	Multiple independent genetic factors at NOS1AP modulate the QT interval in a multi-ethnic population.
PG	e4333
AB	Extremes of electrocardiographic QT interval are associated with increased risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD); thus, identification and characterization of genetic variants that modulate QT interval may elucidate the underlying etiology of SCD. Previous studies have revealed an association between a common genetic variant in NOS1AP and QT interval in populations of European ancestry, but this finding has not been extended to other ethnic populations. We sought to characterize the effects of NOS1AP genetic variants on QT interval in the multi-ethnic population-based Dallas Heart Study (DHS, n = 3,072). The SNP most strongly associated with QT interval in previous samples of European ancestry, rs16847548, was the most strongly associated in White (P = 0.005) and Black (P = 3.6 x 10(-5)) participants, with the same direction of effect in Hispanics (P = 0.17), and further showed a significant SNP x sex-interaction (P = 0.03). A second SNP, rs16856785, uncorrelated with rs16847548, was also associated with QT interval in Blacks (P = 0.01), with qualitatively similar results in Whites and Hispanics. In a previously genotyped cohort of 14,107 White individuals drawn from the combined Atherosclerotic Risk in Communities (ARIC) and Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) cohorts, we validated both the second locus at rs16856785 (P = 7.63 x 10(-8)), as well as the sex-interaction with rs16847548 (P = 8.68 x 10(-6)). These data extend the association of genetic variants in NOS1AP with QT interval to a Black population, with similar trends, though not statistically significant at P&lt;0.05, in Hispanics. In addition, we identify a strong sex-interaction and the presence of a second independent site within NOS1AP associated with the QT interval. These results highlight the consistent and complex role of NOS1AP genetic variants in modulating QT interval.

TI	SnoRNA Snord116 (Pwcr1/MBII-85) deletion causes growth deficiency and hyperphagia in mice.
PG	e1709
AB	Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is the leading genetic cause of obesity. After initial severe hypotonia, PWS children become hyperphagic and morbidly obese, if intake is not restricted. Short stature with abnormal growth hormone secretion, hypogonadism, cognitive impairment, anxiety and behavior problems are other features. PWS is caused by lack of expression of imprinted genes in a approximately 4 mb region of chromosome band 15q11.2. Our previous translocation studies predicted a major role for the C/D box small nucleolar RNA cluster SNORD116 (PWCR1/HBII-85) in PWS. To test this hypothesis, we created a approximately 150 kb deletion of the &gt; 40 copies of Snord116 (Pwcr1/MBII-85) in C57BL/6 mice. Snord116del mice with paternally derived deletion lack expression of this snoRNA. They have early-onset postnatal growth deficiency, but normal fertility and lifespan. While pituitary structure and somatotrophs are normal, liver Igf1 mRNA is decreased. In cognitive and behavior tests, Snord116del mice are deficient in motor learning and have increased anxiety. Around three months of age, they develop hyperphagia, but stay lean on regular and high-fat diet. On reduced caloric intake, Snord116del mice maintain their weight better than wild-type littermates, excluding increased energy requirement as a cause of hyperphagia. Normal compensatory feeding after fasting, and ability to maintain body temperature in the cold indicate normal energy homeostasis regulation. Metabolic chamber studies reveal that Snord116del mice maintain energy homeostasis by altered fuel usage. Prolonged mealtime and increased circulating ghrelin indicate a defect in meal termination mechanism. Snord116del mice, the first snoRNA deletion animal model, reveal a novel role for a non-coding RNA in growth and feeding regulation.

TI	Association of congenital cardiac defects and the C677T methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphism.
PG	704-8
AB	OBJECTIVE: MTHFR C677T polymorphism and hyperhomocysteinemia have been associated with congenital malformations of the heart and neural tube defects. A common missense mutation in the MTHFR gene (C to T substitution at position 677) produces a variant with reduced enzymatic action. The aim of this retrospective case control study was to investigate whether the occurrence of the MTHFR polymorphism is increased in mothers and fathers of children with a congenital heart disease (CHD) in our population. METHODS: We genotyped 31 couples with CHD offspring and 31 control couples for this study by obtaining smears from buccal gingiva cells and analyzed these for the MTHFR polymorphism by hybridization on microarrays. RESULTS: Statistical significance was calculated using the chi-square test and Pearson-exact test, respectively. The prevalence of homozygosity or heterozygosity for the MTHFR polymorphism was not significantly increased in parents of CHD affected children. Nevertheless significance was observed for the association between aortic arch anomalies and the mothers. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study do not show any significant association between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and CHD in our population. Although the numbers are small (n = 3), the MTHFR (C677T) polymorphism may be linked to the development of aortic arch anomalies.

TI	The effect of neurohormonal factors, epigenetic factors, and gut microbiota on risk of obesity.
PG	A96
AB	Molecular, cellular, and epidemiologic findings suggest that neurohormonal, epigenetic, and microbiologic mechanisms may influence risk for obesity by interacting with socioenvironmental factors. Homeostatic and nonhomeostatic neural controls of energy predispose people to obesity, and this predisposition may be exaggerated by the influence of media, marketing, and sleep patterns. Epigenetic gene regulation may account for the influence of modifiable early life or maternal exposures on obesity risk. Alterations in gut flora caused by infant feeding practices or later diet may influence the absorption and storage of energy. Further exploration of how these molecular-cellular mechanisms might increase obesity risk in response to modifiable socioeconomic factors requires the partnership of laboratory and public health researchers.

TI	Huntingtin-interacting protein 14 is a type 1 diabetes candidate protein regulating insulin secretion and beta-cell apoptosis.
PG	E681-8
AB	Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a complex disease characterized by the loss of insulin-secreting beta-cells. Although the disease has a strong genetic component, and several loci are known to increase T1D susceptibility risk, only few causal genes have currently been identified. To identify disease-causing genes in T1D, we performed an in silico &quot;phenome-interactome analysis&quot; on a genome-wide linkage scan dataset. This method prioritizes candidates according to their physical interactions at the protein level with other proteins involved in diabetes. A total of 11 genes were predicted to be likely disease genes in T1D, including the INS gene. An unexpected top-scoring candidate gene was huntingtin-interacting protein (HIP)-14/ZDHHC17. Immunohistochemical analysis of pancreatic sections demonstrated that HIP14 is almost exclusively expressed in insulin-positive cells in islets of Langerhans. RNAi knockdown experiments established that HIP14 is an antiapoptotic protein required for beta-cell survival and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta and IFN-gamma) that mediate beta-cell dysfunction in T1D down-regulated HIP14 expression in insulin-secreting INS-1 cells and in isolated rat and human islets. Overexpression of HIP14 was associated with a decrease in IL-1beta-induced NF-kappaB activity and protection against IL-1beta-mediated apoptosis. Our study demonstrates that the current network biology approach is a valid method to identify genes of importance for T1D and may therefore embody the basis for more rational and targeted therapeutic approaches.

TI	Recessive mutations in the INS gene result in neonatal diabetes through reduced insulin biosynthesis.
PG	3105-10
AB	Heterozygous coding mutations in the INS gene that encodes preproinsulin were recently shown to be an important cause of permanent neonatal diabetes. These dominantly acting mutations prevent normal folding of proinsulin, which leads to beta-cell death through endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis. We now report 10 different recessive INS mutations in 15 probands with neonatal diabetes. Functional studies showed that recessive mutations resulted in diabetes because of decreased insulin biosynthesis through distinct mechanisms, including gene deletion, lack of the translation initiation signal, and altered mRNA stability because of the disruption of a polyadenylation signal. A subset of recessive mutations caused abnormal INS transcription, including the deletion of the C1 and E1 cis regulatory elements, or three different single base-pair substitutions in a CC dinucleotide sequence located between E1 and A1 elements. In keeping with an earlier and more severe beta-cell defect, patients with recessive INS mutations had a lower birth weight (-3.2 SD score vs. -2.0 SD score) and were diagnosed earlier (median 1 week vs. 10 weeks) compared to those with dominant INS mutations. Mutations in the insulin gene can therefore result in neonatal diabetes as a result of two contrasting pathogenic mechanisms. Moreover, the recessively inherited mutations provide a genetic demonstration of the essential role of multiple sequence elements that regulate the biosynthesis of insulin in man.

TI	Mutations at the BLK locus linked to maturity onset diabetes of the young and beta-cell dysfunction.
PG	14460-5
AB	Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a subtype of diabetes defined by an autosomal pattern of inheritance and a young age at onset, often before age 25. MODY is genetically heterogeneous, with 8 distinct MODY genes identified to date and more believed to exist. We resequenced 732 kb of genomic sequence at 8p23 in 6 MODY families unlinked to known MODY genes that showed evidence of linkage at that location. Of the 410 sequence differences that we identified, 5 had a frequency &lt;1% in the general population and segregated with diabetes in 3 of the families, including the 2 showing the strongest support for linkage at this location. The 5 mutations were all placed within 100 kb corresponding to the BLK gene. One resulted in an Ala71Thr substitution; the other 4 were noncoding and determined decreased in vitro promoter activity in reporter gene experiments. We found that BLK--a nonreceptor tyrosine-kinase of the src family of proto-oncogenes--is expressed in beta-cells where it enhances insulin synthesis and secretion in response to glucose by up-regulating transcription factors Pdx1 and Nkx6.1. These actions are greatly attenuated by the Ala71Thr mutation. These findings point to BLK as a previously unrecognized modulator of beta-cell function, the deficit of which may lead to the development of diabetes.

TI	Increased ATPase activity produced by mutations at arginine-1380 in nucleotide-binding domain 2 of ABCC8 causes neonatal diabetes.
PG	18988-92
AB	Gain-of-function mutations in the genes encoding the ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel subunits Kir6.2 (KCNJ11) and SUR1 (ABCC8) are a common cause of neonatal diabetes mellitus. Here we investigate the molecular mechanism by which two heterozygous mutations in the second nucleotide-binding domain (NBD2) of SUR1 (R1380L and R1380C) separately cause neonatal diabetes. SUR1 is a channel regulator that modulates the gating of the pore formed by Kir6.2. K(ATP) channel activity is inhibited by ATP binding to Kir6.2 but is stimulated by MgADP binding, or by MgATP binding and hydrolysis, at the NBDs of SUR1. Functional analysis of purified NBD2 showed that each mutation enhances MgATP hydrolysis by purified isolated fusion proteins of maltose-binding protein and NBD2. Inhibition of ATP hydrolysis by MgADP was unaffected by mutation of R1380, but inhibition by beryllium fluoride (which traps the ATPase cycle in the prehydrolytic state) was reduced. MgADP-dependent activation of K(ATP) channel activity was unaffected. These data suggest that the R1380L and R1380C mutations enhance the off-rate of P(i), thereby enhancing the hydrolytic rate. Molecular modeling studies supported this idea. Because mutant channels were inhibited less strongly by MgATP, this would increase K(ATP) currents in pancreatic beta cells, thus reducing insulin secretion and producing diabetes.

TI	Counting human somatic cell replications: methylation mirrors endometrial stem cell divisions.
PG	17739-44
AB	Cell proliferation may be altered in many diseases, but it is uncertain exactly how to measure total numbers of divisions. Although it is impossible to count every division directly, potentially total numbers of stem cell divisions since birth may be inferred from numbers of somatic errors. The idea is that divisions are surreptitiously recorded by random errors that occur during replication. To test this &quot;molecular clock&quot; hypothesis, epigenetic errors encoded in certain methylation patterns were counted in glands from 30 uteri. Endometrial divisions can differ among women because of differences in estrogen exposures or numbers of menstrual cycles. Consistent with an association between mitotic age and methylation, there was an age-related increase in methylation with stable levels after menopause, and significantly less methylation was observed in lean or older multiparous women. Methylation patterns were diverse and more consistent with niche rather than immortal stem cell lineages. There was no evidence for decreased stem cell survival with aging. An ability to count lifetime numbers of stem cell divisions covertly recorded by random replication errors provides new opportunities to link cell proliferation with aging and cancer.

TI	Disruption of the imprinted Grb10 gene leads to disproportionate overgrowth by an Igf2-independent mechanism.
PG	8292-7
AB	To investigate the function of the Grb10 adapter protein, we have generated mice in which the Grb10 gene was disrupted by a gene-trap insertion. Our experiments confirm that Grb10 is subject to genomic imprinting with the majority of Grb10 expression arising from the maternally inherited allele. Consistent with this, disruption of the maternal allele results in overgrowth of both the embryo and placenta such that mutant mice are at birth approximately 30% larger than normal. This observation establishes that Grb10 is a potent growth inhibitor. In humans, GRB10 is located at chromosome 7p11.2-p12 and has been associated with Silver-Russell syndrome, in which approximately 10% of those affected inherit both copies of chromosome 7 from their mother. Our results indicate that changes in GRB10 dosage could, in at least some cases, account for the severe growth retardation that is characteristic of Silver-Russell syndrome. Because Grb10 is a signaling protein capable of interacting with tyrosine kinase receptors, we tested genetically whether Grb10 might act downstream of insulin-like growth factor 2, a paternally expressed growth-promoting gene. The result indicates that Grb10 action is essentially independent of insulin-like growth factor 2, providing evidence that imprinting acts on at least two major fetal growth axes in a manner consistent with parent-offspring conflict theory.

TI	Mutations in the small heterodimer partner gene are associated with mild obesity in Japanese subjects.
PG	575-80
AB	Mutations in several genes encoding transcription factors of the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) cascade are associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), a monogenic form of early-onset diabetes mellitus. The ability of the orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP, NR0B2) to modulate the transcriptional activity of MODY1 protein, the nuclear receptor HNF-4alpha, suggested SHP as a candidate MODY gene. We screened 173 unrelated Japanese subjects with early-onset diabetes for mutations in this gene and found five different mutations (H53fsdel10, L98fsdel9insAC, R34X, A195S, and R213C) in 6 subjects as well as one apparent polymorphism (R216H), all present in the heterozygous state. Interestingly, all of the subjects with the mutations were mildly or moderately obese at onset of diabetes, and analysis of the lineages of these individuals indicated that the SHP mutations were associated with obesity rather than with diabetes. Therefore, an additional group of 101 unrelated nondiabetic subjects with early-onset obesity was screened for mutations in the SHP gene. Two of the previously observed mutations (R34X and A195S) and two additional mutations (R57W and G189E) were identified in 6 subjects, whereas no mutations were identified in 116 young nondiabetic lean controls (P = 0.0094). Functional studies of the mutant proteins show that the mutations result in the loss of SHP activity. These results suggest that genetic variation in the SHP gene contributes to increased body weight and reveal a pathway leading to this common metabolic disorder in Japanese.

TI	Type 2 diabetes: evidence for linkage on chromosome 20 in 716 Finnish affected sib pairs.
PG	2198-203
AB	We are conducting a genome scan at an average resolution of 10 centimorgans (cM) for type 2 diabetes susceptibility genes in 716 affected sib pairs from 477 Finnish families. To date, our best evidence for linkage is on chromosome 20 with potentially separable peaks located on both the long and short arms. The unweighted multipoint maximum logarithm of odds score (MLS) was 3.08 on 20p (location, chi = 19.5 cM) under an additive model, whereas the weighted MLS was 2.06 on 20q (chi = 57 cM, recurrence risk,lambda(s) = 1. 25, P = 0.009). Weighted logarithm of odds scores of 2.00 (chi = 69.5 cM, P = 0.010) and 1.92 (chi = 18.5 cM, P = 0.013) were also observed. Ordered subset analyses based on sibships with extreme mean values of diabetes-related quantitative traits yielded sets of families who contributed disproportionately to the peaks. Two-hour glucose levels in offspring of diabetic individuals gave a MLS of 2. 12 (P = 0.0018) at 9.5 cM. Evidence from this and other studies suggests at least two diabetes-susceptibility genes on chromosome 20. We have also screened the gene for maturity-onset diabetes of the young 1, hepatic nuclear factor 4-a (HNF-4alpha) in 64 affected sibships with evidence for high chromosomal sharing at its location on chromosome 20q. We found no evidence that sequence changes in this gene accounted for the linkage results we observed.

TI	Effect of maternal diet on the epigenome: implications for human metabolic disease.
PG	64-72
AB	The rapid increase in the incidence of chronic non-communicable diseases over the past two decades cannot be explained solely by genetic and adult lifestyle factors. There is now considerable evidence that the fetal and early postnatal environment also strongly influences the risk of developing such diseases in later life. Human studies have shown that low birth weight is associated with an increased risk of CVD, type II diabetes, obesity and hypertension, although recent studies have shown that over-nutrition in early life can also increase susceptibility to future metabolic disease. These findings have been replicated in a variety of animal models, which have shown that both maternal under	and over-nutrition can induce persistent changes in gene expression and metabolism within the offspring. The mechanism by which the maternal nutritional environment induces such changes is beginning to be understood and involves the altered epigenetic regulation of specific genes. The demonstration of a role for altered epigenetic regulation of genes in the developmental induction of chronic diseases raises the possibility that nutritional or pharmaceutical interventions may be used to modify long-term cardio-metabolic disease risk and combat this rapid rise in chronic non-communicable diseases.

TI	Epigenetics and maternal nutrition: nature v. nurture.
PG	73-81
AB	Under	and over-nutrition during pregnancy has been linked to the later development of diseases such as diabetes and obesity. Epigenetic modifications may be one mechanism by which exposure to an altered intrauterine milieu or metabolic perturbation may influence the phenotype of the organism much later in life. Epigenetic modifications of the genome provide a mechanism that allows the stable propagation of gene expression from one generation of cells to the next. This review highlights our current knowledge of epigenetic gene regulation and the evidence that chromatin remodelling and histone modifications play key roles in adipogenesis and the development of obesity. Epigenetic modifications affecting processes important to glucose regulation and insulin secretion have been described in the pancreatic beta-cells and muscle of the intrauterine growth-retarded offspring, characteristics essential to the pathophysiology of type-2 diabetes. Epigenetic regulation of gene expression contributes to both adipocyte determination and differentiation in in vitro models. The contributions of histone acetylation, histone methylation and DNA methylation to the process of adipogenesis in vivo remain to be evaluated.

TI	Periconceptional nutrition and the early programming of a life of obesity or adversity.
PG	307-14
AB	Women entering pregnancy with a high body weight and fat mass have babies at increased risk of becoming overweight or obese in childhood and later life. It is not known, whether exposure to a high level of maternal nutrition before pregnancy and exposure to a high transplacental nutrient supply in later pregnancy act through similar mechanisms to program later obesity. Using the pregnant sheep we have shown that maternal overnutrition in late pregnancy results in an upregulation of PPARgamma activated genes in fetal visceral fat and a subsequent increase in the mass of subcutaneous fat in the postnatal lamb. Exposure to maternal overnutrition during the periconceptional period alone, however, results in an increase in total body fat mass in female lambs only with a dominant effect on visceral fat depots. Thus the early programming of later obesity may result from 'two hits', the first occurring as a result of maternal overnutrition during the periconceptional period and the second occurring as a result of increased fetal nutrition in late pregnancy. Whilst a short period of dietary restriction during the periconceptional period reverses the impact of periconceptional overnutrition on the programming of obesity, it also results in an increased lamb adrenal weight and cortisol stress response, together with changes in the epigenetic state of the insulin like growth factor 2 (IGF2) gene in the adrenal. Thus, not all of the effects of dietary restriction in overweight or obese mother in the periconceptional period may be beneficial in the longer term.

TI	Pathways linking the early environment to long-term health and lifespan.
PG	323-36
AB	The intrauterine environment is a major contributor to normal physiological growth and development of an individual. Disturbances at this critical time can affect the long-term health of the offspring. Low birth weight individuals have strong correlations with increased susceptibility to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in later-life. These observations led to the Thrifty Phenotype Hypothesis which suggested that these associations arose because of the response of a growing fetus to a suboptimal environment such as poor nutrition. Animal models have shown that environmentally induced intrauterine growth restriction increases the risk of a variety of diseases later in life. These detrimental features are also observed in high birth weight offspring from mothers who were obese or consumed a high fat diet during gestation. Recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have elucidated several potential candidates for the long-term effects of the early environment on the function and metabolism of a cell. These include: (1) Epigenetic alterations (e.g. DNA methylation and histone modifications), which regulate specific gene expression and can be influenced by the environment, both during gestation and early postnatal life and (2) Oxidative stress that changes the balance between reactive oxygen species generation (e.g. through mitochondrial dysfunction) and antioxidant defense capacity. This has permanent effects on cellular ageing such as regulation of telomere length. Further understanding of these processes will help in the development of therapeutic strategies to increase healthspan and reduced the burden of age-associated diseases.

TI	Assisted reproduction and its neuroendocrine impact on the offspring.
PG	161-74
AB	Assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) have been widely used during the last three decades and progressively more children are born with the help of such methods. There is now evidence that ARTs may be associated with slight epigenetic modifications in the expression of several genes that could have a long-term impact on the health of the offspring. Also, a clear association between such techniques and genomic imprinting abnormalities has been reported. The neuroendocrine impact of ART on the offspring includes slight elevations of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), as well as increased circulating triglyceride concentrations, in children born after ART, especially in those with rapid catch-up growth in weight during early childhood. However, the postnatal growth of most children after ART is normal and no increased incidence of the full metabolic syndrome has been observed in these children and adolescents. Moreover, the pace and timing of puberty of such children is normal and no increased incidence of premature adrenarche could be discerned in ART children in the absence of restricted fetal growth. Finally, a slight modification of the set point of thyroid stimulating hormone sensitivity was observed in ART children, without an apparent impact on thyroid hormone secretion. This has been attributed to epigenetic changes. Questions remain to be answered regarding the future reproductive capacity of children born after ART, as well as their cardiovascular risk in later adult life. Long-term prospective studies should be performed to provide robust evidence.

PG	330-9
AB	Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a genetic disease predisposing to the development of various tumours (haemangioblastomas of the neuraxis and retina, tumours of the membranous labyrinth, renal clear cell carcinomas or cysts, phaeochromocytomas, pancreatic cysts or tumours, epididymal cystadenomas), affecting one in 36,000 people. Renal cancer constitutes one of the main causes of death. The VHL gene, situated at 3p25-26, is a tumour suppressor gene which plays a major role in regulation of VEGF transcription and expression. The germ cell mutation can be identified in 70% of patients. Somatic mutations of the VHL gene are also responsible for sporadic clear cell carcinomas. In the urological setting, any patient presenting with &quot;sporadic&quot; bilateral clear cell renal cancer or detected at an early age, or bilateral epididymal cystadenomas, should be investigated for the presence of VHL disease.

TI	No association between the PPARG gene and schizophrenia in a British population.
PG	273-7
AB	It has consistently been reported that patients with schizophrenia have an increased risk of type-2 diabetes. To investigate a genetic link between these two diseases, the combined effects of the PLA2G4A, PTGS2 and PPARG genes were tested among 221 British nuclear families consisting of fathers, mothers and affected offspring with schizophrenia. A total of 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested and the likelihood-based association analysis for nuclear families was used to analyse the genotyping data. Eight SNPs detected across the PPARG gene did not show allelic association with schizophrenia; a weak association was detected at rs2745557 in the PTGS2 locus (chi2=4.19, p=0.041) and rs10798059 in the PLA2G4A locus (chi2=4.28, p=0.039) but these associations did not survive after 10,000 permutations to correct the p-value (global p=0.246). The gene-gene interaction test did not show any evidence of either cis-phase interactions for the PLA2G4A and PTGS2 combinations or a trans-phase interaction for the PLA2G4A and PPARG combinations. The PPARG gene has been reported to be strongly associated with type-2 diabetes, but the present study did not support the hypothesis that the PPARG gene may also play an important role in the development of schizophrenia.

TI	A proteomic approach for the characterization of C677T mutation of the human gene methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase.
PG	5350-61
AB	Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) catalyzes the conversion of methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH2H4folate) to methyltetrahydrofolate (CH3H4folate). The C677T mutation is a common polymorphism of the human enzyme that leads to the replacement of Ala222Val, thermolability of MTHFR, and mild elevation of plasma homocysteine levels. A mild hyperhomocysteinemia is known to be risk factor for cardiovascular and thrombotic diseases, ischemic stroke, neural tube defects, late on-set dementia, and pregnancy complications. Human plasma of subjects carrying the C677T mutation in the MTHFR gene has been investigated for their protein pattern in order to identify novel molecular hallmarks. 2-D analysis of the plasma protein allowed the identification of a specific pattern associated with the TT mutant genotype. Noteworthy, we found one spot shifted to a more basic pI in mutant individuals, and MS identification corresponded to vitamin D-binding protein (DBP or group component (Gc) globulin). MS/MS peptide sequencing allowed to discriminate different allelic variants in the investigated clinical groups. These data confirmed by molecular genetic analysis highlight the novel association between the C677T MTHFR genotype with the Gc2 polymorphism of the DBP. Moreover, we found a quantitative reduction of Apolipoprotein A-I in mutant individuals, which was associated, in previous studies by others to an increased cardiovascular risk.

TI	[The evaluation of level of epigenetic indicator--5-methylcytosine in smoking and non-smoking patients with mild essential hypertension].
PG	695-7
AB	5-methylcytosine (m5C, 5mC) is a nucleotide occurring naturally in genomic DNA and play an important role in regulation of genes expression. Methylation of cytosine in DNA is an epigenetic modification and different intrinsic and extrinsic factors can influence on its level. For example, it is subject to modification and/or degradation by the free radicals which are commonly present in environment of human, among others the cigarette smoke. The reactions of m5C with free radicals lead to origination of many products which effect is decrease of level of m5C in DNA (hypomethylation) and excessive expression of genes inducing development of different diseases, especially cardiovascular system diseases. The aim of the study was statement if exist differences of level of 5-methylcytosine in DNA between smoking and non-smoking patients suffering from mild essential hypertension. The study group was composed of 30 patients suffering from mild essential hypertension (21 females and 40 males) aged from 18 to 55 years (32.4+/-10.3 years). The group of smoker was composed of 13 patients (5 females and 8 males) and the group of non-smokers was composed of 17 patients (7 females and 10 males). 3-5 ml of blood was sampled on EDTA and then thin-layer chromatography analysis of 5-methylcytosine level in DNA after previous enzymatic hydrolysis of DNA and radioactive phosphorus labeling [32p] was performed. The mean level of 5-methylcytosine (m5C) were 1.30+/-0.56 [%] in non-smoking patients, and 1.28+/-0.42 [%] in smoking patients suffering from mild essential hypertension. There is no significant statistically differences between non-smoking and smoking patients (p&gt;0.4). In the study the following conclusion was drawn: the level of m5C in DNA of patients suffering from mild essential hypertension in the study is independent of smoking (p&gt;0.4) in patients with mild essential hypertension. However it supposes, out of regard for theoretic datum suggestive such influence, the study should be performed in more frequent group of patients.

PG	32-6
AB	AIM: The aim of the study was to evaluate an association between ACE genotypes and blood pressure (BP) disturbances in children and adolescents withType 1 diabetes mellitus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 126 normo-albuminuric, type 1 diabetic children and adolescents at the age 10.5-19.7 years, and duration of diabetes 2.0-17.8 years, were included in the study. All patients were clinically normotensive and normoalbuminuric. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory BP monitoring was undertaken in all patients. The values of systolic BP, diastolic BP, mean arterial BP blood pressure and diurnal variation in BP were estimated. Prehypertension was diagnosed as BP values between 90pc or 120/80 mmHg and 95pc. ACE genotypes were assessed using polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: In 48 individuals (38.1%) prehypertension was diagnosed. ACE genotypes distributed in patients were as follow: 31 (24.6%) genotype II, 45 (35.7%)--ID, and 50 (39.7%)--DD. Patients with DD genotype had higher nocturnal systolic BP (104 vs. 101 mmHg; p=0.029), diastolic BP (54 vs. 52 mmHg, p=0.003) and mean arterial BP (71 vs. 68 mmHg, p=0.003) as compared to carriers of the I allele (group ID + II). In the group DD in compare to the group ID + II lower nocturnal depletion in diastolic BP (18.0 vs. 20.5 mmHg, p=0.024) and mean BP (14.8 vs 16.6 mmHg, p=0.049) was observed. 14% patients of the DD group were non-dipper and 1.32% in the group ID + II (p=0.01). There was no differences in the prevalence of prehypertension between genotype groups (II+ID vs. DD: 38.2 vs. 38.0%, ns). CONCLUSIONS: Genotype DD is associated with nocturnal BP abnormalities in normotensive and normo-albuminuric children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. There is no relationship between frequency of prehypertension and ACE gene polymorphism.

TI	The MTHFR 677C-&gt;T polymorphism and the risk of congenital heart defects: a literature review and meta-analysis.
PG	743-53
AB	BACKGROUND: Periconceptional folic acid supplementation may protect against congenital heart defects (CHDs). Identification of candidate genes in folate metabolism has suggested that the 677C--&gt;T polymorphism in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene may be particularly associated with the risk of CHDs. AIM: To assess the relationship between MTHFR 677C--&gt;T and CHDs by literature review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Studies were identified by searches of electronic literature for papers focussing on MTHFR 677C--&gt;T and the risk of any type of CHD. Both case-control comparisons and transmission-disequilibrium tests (TDTs) in family-based designs were included. RESULTS: We found 13 eligible studies. Of 10 case-control studies, four focused on the fetal polymorphism, two studied the maternal polymorphism, and a further four investigated both. Three further publications used a family-based association study to assess the effect of the T allele on cardiac development. Overall analysis yielded odds ratios of 1.3 (95%CI 0.97-1.73) and 1.2 (95%CI 0.83-1.74) for fetal and maternal MTHFR TT genotypes, respectively. TDTs revealed no association between fetal 677T allele and CHDs. DISCUSSION: This relatively small meta-analysis found no substantial evidence of increased CHD risk in individuals with MTHFR 677CT and TT genotypes. Heterogeneity regarding population background, study design and type of heart defects complicates the pooling and comparison of the studies. The effect of modification by periconceptional folic acid intake should be taken into account. Further larger studies and well-defined phenotypic subcategory analyses are needed to decide whether the MTHFR 677C--&gt;T polymorphism of the affected child and/or their mother is truly a risk factor for the development of CHDs.

TI	The heritability of plasma homocysteine, and the influence of genetic variation in the homocysteine methylation pathway.
PG	495-9
AB	BACKGROUND: The extent of genetic influence on plasma homocysteine, a risk factor for ischaemic heart disease, is uncertain. Many association studies have investigated common polymorphisms and their role in hyperhomocysteinaemia, but only the thermolabile variant of methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) has shown an association (small but robust). AIM: To estimate the heritability of plasma homocysteine and the contributions of well-studied common SNPs in the three main candidate genes in the homocysteine methylation pathway. DESIGN: Twin study. METHODS: We studied 216 monozygotic and 790 dizygotic pairs of twins; all were women. Blood was collected after overnight fasting for measurement of homocysteine, folate, vitamin B12, and extraction of DNA. Heritability was estimated by structural modelling, including correction for known environmental influences, particularly serum folate. The frequency of a common coding SNP in MTHFR and methionine synthase (MTR), and two coding SNPs in methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) were measured in dizygotic twins by ABI 7700 Sequence Detection, and the contribution of each to homocysteine variance was determined. RESULTS: The heritability of homocysteine was 57% (95%CI 51-63%). The highest contribution to homocysteine was serum folate, accounting for 10.13% of variance. This was twice the total genetic contribution of 4.56%, and only the C1763T SNP of MTRR showed significant association with homocysteine. DISCUSSION: Homocysteine has one of the highest heritabilities of common risk factors for ischaemic heart disease. This is not accounted for by the commonly studied SNPs in MTHFR, MTR and MTRR.

TI	Polymorphisms in the ACE and ADRB2 genes and risks of aging-associated phenotypes: the case of myocardial infarction.
PG	13-21
AB	Multiple functions of the beta2-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) genes warrant studies of their associations with aging-related phenotypes. We focus on multimarker analyses and analyses of the effects of compound genotypes of two polymorphisms in the ADRB2 gene, rs1042713 and rs1042714, and 11 polymorphisms of the ACE gene, on the risk of such an aging-associated phenotype as myocardial infarction (MI). We used the data from a genotyped sample of the Framingham Heart Study Offspring (FHSO) cohort (n = 1500) followed for about 36 years with six examinations. The ADRB2 rs1042714 (C--&gt;G) polymorphism and two moderately correlated (r(2) = 0.77) ACE polymorphisms, rs4363 (A--&gt;G) and rs12449782 (A--&gt;G), were significantly associated with risks of MI in this aging cohort in multimarker models. Predominantly linked ACE genotypes exhibited opposite effects on MI risks, e.g., the AA (rs12449782) genotype had a detrimental effect, whereas the predominantly linked AA (rs4363) genotype exhibited a protective effect. This trade-off occurs as a result of the opposite effects of rare compound genotypes of the ACE polymorphisms with a single dose of the AG heterozygote. This genetic trade-off is further augmented by the selective modulating effect of the rs1042714 ADRB2 polymorphism. The associations were not altered by adjustment for common MI risk factors. The results suggest that effects of single specific genetic variants of the ADRB2 and ACE genes on MI can be readily altered by gene-gene or/and gene-environmental interactions, especially in large heterogeneous samples. Multimarker genetic analyses should benefit studies of complex aging-associated phenotypes.

TI	Epigenetic regulation during mammalian oogenesis.
PG	74-80
AB	The advent of the epigenetic era has sparked a new frontier in molecular research and the understanding of how development can be regulated beyond direct alterations of the genome. Thus far, the focal point of epigenetic regulation during development has been chromatin modifications that control differential gene expression by DNA methylation and histone alterations. But what of events that alter gene expression without direct influence on the DNA itself? The present review focuses on epigenetic pathways regulating development from oogenesis to organogenesis and back that do not involve methylation of cytosine in DNA. We discuss target components of epigenetic modification such as organelle development, compartmentalisation of maternal factors and molecular mediators in the oocyte and how these factors acting during oogenesis impact on later development. Epigenetic regulation of development, be it via cytosine methylation or not, has wide-ranging effects on the subsequent success of a pregnancy and the intrinsic health of offspring. Perturbations in epigenetic regulation have been clearly associated with disease states in adult offspring, including Type II diabetes, hypertension, cancers and infertility. A clear understanding of all epigenetic mechanisms is paramount when considering the increased use of assisted reproductive techniques and the risks associated with their use.

TI	The associations between maternal and fetal angiotensinogen M235T polymorphism and pregnancy-induced hypertension in Chinese women.
PG	640-4
AB	This study was to investigate whether the maternal and fetal angiotensinogen (AGT) M235T polymorphism were associated with the risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) in Chinese Han ethnic women. Using a case-control mother-baby dyads study, a total of 226 maternal/offspring pairs were recruited at Anyang Maternal and Child Health Hospital from January 2008 to December 2009. Genomic DNA was extracted from maternal venous and cord blood. We genotyped the AGT M235T polymorphism by using PCR-RFLP assay and examined the association with PIH using logistic regression analysis. In the current study, the maternal AGT M235T polymorphism showed no effect on the risk of PIH (P = .786) while the fetal AGT M235T polymorphism is significantly associated with PIH in Chinese Han ethnic women (P = .004). The fetus carrying TT genotype is a protective factor in developing PIH in the study population (OR = .28, 95% CI = .14-0.59).

TI	Angiotensin-converting enzyme and adducin-1 polymorphisms in women with preeclampsia and gestational hypertension.
PG	819-26
AB	The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism and the Adducin-1 (ADD1) G460W nonsense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) have previously been associated to hypertension, whereas their association with preeclampsia (PE) and gestational hypertension (GH) is still controversial. We genotyped ACE I/D, ADD1 G460W, and ADD1 S586C polymorphisms in 672 unrelated pregnant women: 204 PE (81/204 mild PE), 56 GH, and 412 controls, evaluating both their single and combined effects on these pathologies. The genotype combination of the 3 polymorphisms was not statistically different in cases versus controls, nor were ACE and ADD1 polymorphisms in GH. Nevertheless, the distribution of ACE genotypes was different in PE. This was confirmed in mild PE, whereas no significance was found in severe PE. This could suggest that different factors may lead to mild and severe PE, with ACE polymorphism playing a more important role in the mild form.

TI	Perinatal exposure of rats to Bisphenol A affects fertility of male offspring--an overview.
PG	359-62
AB	Endocrine disruptors (ED) induce both functional and behavioral reproductive abnormalities. Bisphenol A (BPA) is a known ED that leaches from polycarbonate plastics, as such human exposure is common. Maternal BPA exposure has been shown to have negative effects on the fertility of male offspring. Pregnant rats exposed perinatally to environmentally relevant doses of BPA gave birth to offspring with significantly impaired spermatogenesis and fertility. Perinatal exposure had deleterious effects on the male germ line which manifested as impairments in the fertility of F(1) male offspring and subsequent F(2) and F(3) generations. This overview is an attempt to summarize the currently available data in the literature with regards to perinatal BPA exposure and male fertility.

TI	6q24 transient neonatal diabetes.
PG	199-204
AB	Transient Neonatal Diabetes (type 1) is the commonest cause of diabetes presenting in the first week of life. The majority of infants recover by 3 months of age but are predisposed to developing type 2 diabetes in later life. It is associated with low birth weight but rapid catch up by 1 year of life. The condition is usually due to genetic or epigenetic aberrations at an imprinted locus on chromosome 6q24 and can be sporadic or inherited. Early diagnosis alters medical treatment strategies and differentiates it from other types of early onset diabetes. In some individuals, diabetes may be the initial presentation of a more complex imprinting disorder due to recessive mutations in the gene ZFP57 and may be associated with other developmental problems.

TI	Maternal nutrition, intrauterine programming and consequential risks in the offspring.
PG	203-11
AB	It is traditionally believed that genetic susceptibility and adult faulty lifestyle lead to type 2 diabetes, a chronic non-communicable disease. The &quot;Developmental Origins of Health and Disease&quot; (DOHaD) model proposes that the susceptibility to type 2 diabetes originates in the intrauterine life by environmental fetal programming, further exaggerated by rapid childhood growth, i.e. a biphasic nutritional insult. Both fetal under nutrition (sometimes manifested as low birth weight) and over nutrition (the baby of a diabetic mother) increase the risk of future diabetes. The common characteristic of these two types of babies is their high adiposity. An imbalance in nutrition seems to play an important role, and micronutrients seem particularly important. Normal to high maternal folate status coupled with low vitamin B(12) status predicted higher adiposity and insulin resistance in Indian babies. Thus, 1-C (methyl) metabolism seems to play a key role in fetal programming. DOHaD represents a paradigm shift in the model for prevention of the chronic non-communicable diseases.

TI	Metabolic programming in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance.
PG	105-13
AB	This review focuses on different animal models of nutrient perturbations, inclusive of restrictive and excessive states mimicking human situations during pregnancy and lactation that cause aberrations in the offspring. These aberrations consist of diminished insulin sensitivity in the presence of defective insulin production. These phenotypic changes are due to altered peripheral tissue post-insulin receptor signaling mechanisms and pancreatic beta-islet insulin synthesis and secretion defects. While these changes during in utero or postnatal life serve as essential adaptations to overcome adverse conditions, they become maladaptive subsequently and set the stage for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Pregnancy leads to gestational diabetes with trans-generational propagation of the insulin resistant phenotype. This is in response to the metabolically aberrant maternal in utero environment, and tissue specific epigenetic perturbations that permanently alter expression of critical genes transmitted to future generations. These heritable aberrations consisting of altered DNA methylation and histone modifications remodel chromatin and affect transcription of key genes. Along with an altered in utero environment, these chromatin modifications contribute to the world-wide epidemic of type 2 diabetes mellitus, with nutrient excess dominating in developed and nutrient restriction in developing countries.

TI	[The transgenerational mechanisms in developmental programming of metabolic diseases].
PG	41-52
AB	Human epidemiological and experimental animal studies have shown that suboptimal environments in the womb and during early neonatal life alter growth and may program offspring susceptibility to lifelong health problems. One of the most interesting and significant feature of developmental programming is the evidence that adverse consequences of altered intrauterine environments can be passed from first generation to second generation offspring. To obtain the transgenerational phenotype, a negative environment is required during fetal or early neonatal life, the physiologic phenotype or disease can be transmitted through the germ line and the subsequent generations are not directly exposed to the environmental factor. The hypothesis has become well accepted by compelling animal studies that define the outcome of specific challenges such as: 1) nutrient restriction or overfeeding during pregnancy and lactation; 2) uterine blood flow restriction; 3) fetal exposure to inappropriately high levels of glucocorticoids, and 4) experimental maternal diabetes. Maternal protein restriction in the rat adversely affects glucose metabolism of male and female second generation offspring in a gender and developmental time window-specific manner. Other studies have proved transgenerational passage of effects resulting from treatment of pregnant rats with dexamethasone by either maternal or paternal lines. First generation female diabetic offspring of F0 rats treated with streptozotocin during pregnancy had F2 offspring with altered glucose and carbohydrate metabolism. The studies suggest that the mechanisms involved in developmental programming are likely epigenetic rather than due to DNA sequence mutations. Many individuals all over the world experience undernutrition, stress, hyperglycemia and other negative environmental factors during pregnancy and/or lactation. Insult during this critical period of development may induce malprogramming and adversely alter not only the F1 generation but also future generations. Preventing or treating these conditions will help to minimize the risk of transmission of metabolic diseases to future generations.

TI	[Molecular diagnosis of Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes: methylation, cytogenetics and FISH analysis].
PG	367-74
AB	BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes is difficult, since their phenotypic manifestations are variable and unspecific. The study of the methylation state of DNA in 15(q11-q13) using polymerase chain reaction, called methylation test, allows the diagnosis of most patients with Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes, irrespective if the underlying molecular alteration is a deletion, uniparental disomy or a punctual imprinting mutation. AIM: To assess the effectiveness of methylation test in the diagnosis of Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty seven cases with a presumptive diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome and 25 with the presumptive diagnosis of Angelman syndrome were studied. Methylation test was done in genomic DNA obtained from peripheral lymphocytes. RESULTS: Methylation test confirmed the clinical diagnosis in 11 of 37 patients with Prader Willi (30%) and 6 of 25 patients with Angelman syndrome (24%). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical criteria overestimate the diagnosis of Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes. The initial diagnosis should be confirmed with the methylation test and, if necessary, with FISH that will detect most deletions in the region.

TI	[Epigenetic origin of diabetes and growth disorders].
PG	533, 535-7
AB	The understanding of genomic imprinting has made us realize that maternal and paternal contributions to the embryo are different. Disturbances during the imprinting process may lead to different pathologies due to an imbalance of gene expression either maternally or paternally derived. Known epigenetic diseases such as neonatal diabetes, growth retardation or overgrowth syndromes as well as cancer are better understood. It has become clear that environmental factors can be at the origin of such epigenetic changes. Careful analysis and diagnosis of epigenetic diseases are important for patient treatment and outcome.

TI	[The phenomenon of genomic &quot;imprinting&quot; and its implications in clinical neuropediatrics].
PG	69-73
AB	OBJECTIVE: We comment on the most important advances related to the phenomenon of genomic 'imprinting' in clinical paediatric neurology. DEVELOPMENT: Initially, we review the biological findings related to this subject and establish various concepts. Later, we attempt to clarify the different mechanisms of expression of the phenomenon 'imprinting' and its application in clinical practice. We give a detailed review of the various neurological disorders in which this genetic phenomenon has been involved to date. Finally, we attempt to determine when this genetic alteration should be suspected and which molecular biology techniques should be used to confirm the diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: 1. Clinical diagnosis suspecting that the presence of genomic 'imprinting' may be the mechanism causing a particular pathology should be based on a family tree showing that both sexes and all generations are affected and that the severity of the same disease varies among different members of the same family; 2. Study strategy includes studying the methylation pattern of the DNA. If there are changes in this, PCR should be done to show the exact pattern of the alteration.

TI	Angiotensin converting enzyme DD genotype is associated with development of rheumatic heart disease in Egyptian children.
PG	17-21
AB	Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene polymorphism was previously studied in some cardiovascular diseases. There are only few studies which investigated this polymorphism in patients with rheumatic heart disease (RHD). The results of these investigations are inconsistent. Furthermore, gene polymorphism distribution is different in various ethnic populations. We conducted this study to demonstrate this gene polymorphism in Egyptian children with RHD. Leukocytes DNA was extracted from 139 patients with RHD and 79 healthy control children. After amplification by the PCR, the products were separated by electrophoresis in 6% polyacrylamide gel and visualized after ethidium bromide staining with UV light. The PCR product is a 190-bp fragment in the absence of the insertion (D allele) and a 490-bp fragment in the presence of the insertion (I allele). Gene polymorphism was as follows: DD gene when lane contains only 190-bp fragment, II gene when lane contains only 490-bp fragment and ID gene when lane contains both fragments. We found that gene polymorphism in both control and patients groups followed the following order of distribution from highest to lowest: ID, II, DD gene. The frequency in control group was 49.4, 36.7, and 13.9%, respectively. In patients groups, the gene frequency was 42.5, 30.9, and 26.6%, respectively. DD gene frequency differs significantly between the two groups. We concluded that patients with RHD have a higher ACE-DD genotype than normal control. ACE-DD genotype may be a risk factor for RHD in Egyptian children.

TI	[The genetic application for Japanese patients with coronary artery diseases using restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) of apolipoprotein gene].
PG	101-6
AB	We applied restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) for apolipoprotein (apoAI, apoCIII, apoAIV, apoCI, and apoB) genes to analyze differences between Japanese and Caucasian in allele frequencies as well as those between normal Japanese subjects and patients with coronary artery disease confirmed with coronary arteriography. Although the allelic fragment sizes in the two racial groups showed complete correspondence, the allelic frequencies of these markers detected by the combination of probes and restriction enzymes showed 60% difference in Japanese and Caucasian. There was a significant (p &lt; 0.01) difference between the normal subjects (with arteriographically-confirmed absence of stenosis in all coronary branches) and those with severe coronary artery disease (50 to 100% stenosis in at least one branch) in plasma levels of apoAI, apoB, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol. RFLP analysis for 13 markers, however, revealed no significant difference between these groups when analyzed in subjects of all ages (range, 12 to 82 years; N = 306). However, when analysis was restricted to data for 12-to 50-year-olds, a significant (p &lt; 0.02) difference between the normal control group and the severe coronary artery disease group in 3' apoB probe and EcoRI enzyme test results. An acquired and environmental factors were assumed to be involved in this disease because the correlation between allelic frequencies and coronary artery disease status showed dilution when the subject age distribution included older subjects.

TI	Strong association of insulin gene INS-VNTR polymorphisms with type 1 diabetes in the Romanian population.
PG	313-23
AB	Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) is a common, chronic disease with autoimmune pathogeny, conditioned by genetic factors. Class II HLA DR and DQ and insulin gene polymorphisms encode for most of the T1DM genetic susceptibility. We have previously shown that class I alleles of the insulin gene INS-VNTR locus are strongly associated with T1DM in the Romanian population. The aim of our study was to confirm the contribution of INS-VNTR to T1DM genetic susceptibility in Romania. For this we typed the insulin gene -23HphI A/T polymorphism (an accurate marker for the INS-VNTR alleles) on 219 Romanian T1DM families using Taqman. Allele transmission to diabetics and unaffected siblings was assessed using the Transmission Disequilibrium Test (TDT). We found a significantly increased transmission of -23HphI A allele to diabetics (78.31% transmission, pTDT = 2.4 e-07) which confirms our previous findings. Combined with the data from the first 204 Romanian T1DM families, the transmission of -23HphI A allele to diabetics is almost 80% (79.78%, pTDT = 2.8 e-15). This percentage indicates the same level of predisposition as for the most diabetogenic HLA's. In conclusion, our results indicate an exceptionally strong association of the class I INS-VNTR alleles with T1DM for the Romanian population.

TI	Insulin gene variable number of tandem repeats is associated with increased fat mass during adolescence in non-obese girls.
PG	163-8
AB	Obesity and related disorders have become a major health problem. Understanding the interaction between genetic and environmental factors influencing the susceptibility to develop obesity is important when pinpointing people at risk. In a longitudinal study of 256 non-obese adolescents, the influence of the insulin gene (INS) variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) on anthropometric measures and fat mass was investigated. The adolescents were examined at the age of 12.4 (2.3) (mean, SD) and 16.2 (2.3) years, and at follow-up with dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) for measurement of body composition. INS VNTR classes I and III alleles were investigated using the -23T/A single nucleotide polymorphism as a surrogate marker. There was a non-significant trend towards increased body mass index (BMI) and fat mass with the class III allele in girls. Homozygotes for the INS VNTR class III allele had a greater increase in BMI compared with those that were homozygous or heterozygous for the class I allele (3.8 (1.6) versus 2.4 (1.9) kg/m2, p = 0.03), and they had higher fat mass (36.4 (3.9) versus 31.3 (6.8)%, p = 0.02) at follow-up. Our finding that homozygosity of the INS VNTR class III allele seems to predispose to increased weight gain and fat mass raises the possibility that this genotype may be one of the important factors in the gene-environment interaction that eventually results in overweight and insulin resistance.

TI	Polymorphic analysis of the human MHC-linked heat shock protein 70 (HSP70-2) and HSP70-Hom genes in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM).
PG	491-5
AB	In the present study we characterized the frequencies of two polymorphisms within the MHC-linked heat shock protein (HSP) 70 genes in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) (n = 114) and healthy control individuals (n = 110). Significant differences in genotype and allelic frequencies were observed for both polymorphisms between randomly selected patients and controls. However, for the HSP70-2 polymorphisms this was solely due to linkage disequilibrium with DR3. The rate HSP70-Hom 2-allele was significantly more frequent in controls than in patients. It showed strong association with certain tumour necrosis factor (TNF) (class III) and HLA-B and -A (class I) alleles independent of HLA-DQ and -DR alleles. By typing 257 individuals from 55 IDDM multiple-case families two extended MHC-haplotypes, including class II-, TNF	and class I-markers, carrying the rare HSP70-Hom allele were defined. One was only transmitted to diabetic offspring, whereas the other was only transmitted to unaffected offspring. The functional implication of the polymorphism in the heat shock-inducible HSP70-2 gene was analysed by studying HSP70-2 mRNA expression after heat shock in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from individuals with different HSP70-2 genotypes. Preliminary data showed that individuals homozygous for the PstI 8.5-kb allele consistently had slightly lower expression than heterozygous and 9.0-kb homozygous individuals.

TI	Monocyte function in IDDM patients and healthy individuals.
PG	297-311
AB	Interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) may be pathogenetically important in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), which is associated with genes of the HLA region. Since a regulatory role of HLA region genes on monokine production may exist, we looked for an association between the monokine and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) responses of monocytes (Mo) from 20 healthy males (18-50 years) with HLA-DR types relevant for IDDM susceptibility and resistance (DR1,2, DR1,3, DR1,4, DR3,4). Monokine assays were established and evaluated and the secretions of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and PGE2 measured in Mo cultures (2h, 6h, 20h) prepared by endotoxin-free techniques and stimulated by low-dose E. coli lipopolysaccharides (LPS). There were no significant associations between Mo responses and HLA-DR phenotype. Likewise, Mo from DR2 (n = 5) and DR4 (n = 5) homozygous healthy males demonstrated no significant differences in monokine and PGE2 responses of Mo. In the HLA class III region a diallelic TNF-beta gene NcoI polymorphism consisting of alleles of 5.5 kb and 10.5 kb was recently described and associated with susceptibility to autoimmune diseases including IDDM. We report that IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha responses of Mo from TNF-beta 10.5 kb homozygous healthy individuals were significantly higher than for TNF-beta 5.5/10.5 kb heterozygotes. IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha responses of Mo from males (18-35 years) with newly diagnosed (n = 10) and long-standing IDDM (n = 10) and from age	and HLA-DR-matched healthy males (n = 10) were studied. LPS, gamma interferon (IFN), and TNF-alpha-stimulated Mo cultures were investigated. No significant differences were found between Mo responses of IDDM patients and controls. IFN (1000 U/ml) in the presence of LPS significantly potentiated LPS-stimulated Mo TNF-alpha secretion and reduced the levels of IL-1 beta immunoreactivity in Mo lysates. IFN and TNF-alpha did not have any effects on LPS-stimulated Mo secretion of IL-1 beta immunoreactivity. We conclude that Mo IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha production is normal in patients with recent-onset and long-standing IDDM. The interindividual differences in monokine responses may be accounted for by the diallelic human TNF-beta gene polymorphism rather than by HLA class II genes. This observation may be important for understanding the association of certain HLA haplotypes with autoimmune phenomena and disease.

TI	Overexpression of alpha2A-adrenergic receptors contributes to type 2 diabetes.
PG	217-20
AB	Several common genetic variations have been associated with type 2 diabetes, but the exact disease mechanisms are still poorly elucidated. Using congenic strains from the diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rat, we identified a 1.4-megabase genomic locus that was linked to impaired insulin granule docking at the plasma membrane and reduced beta cell exocytosis. In this locus, Adra2a, encoding the alpha2A-adrenergic receptor [alpha(2A)AR], was significantly overexpressed. Alpha(2A)AR mediates adrenergic suppression of insulin secretion. Pharmacological receptor antagonism, silencing of receptor expression, or blockade of downstream effectors rescued insulin secretion in congenic islets. Furthermore, we identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the human ADRA2A gene for which risk allele carriers exhibited overexpression of alpha(2A)AR, reduced insulin secretion, and increased type 2 diabetes risk. Human pancreatic islets from risk allele carriers exhibited reduced granule docking and secreted less insulin in response to glucose; both effects were counteracted by pharmacological alpha(2A)AR antagonists.

TI	Patient-specific embryonic stem cells derived from human SCNT blastocysts.
PG	1777-83
AB	Patient-specific, immune-matched human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are anticipated to be of great biomedical importance for studies of disease and development and to advance clinical deliberations regarding stem cell transplantation. Eleven hESC lines were established by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) of skin cells from patients with disease or injury into donated oocytes. These lines, nuclear transfer (NT)-hESCs, grown on human feeders from the same NT donor or from genetically unrelated individuals, were established at high rates, regardless of NT donor sex or age. NT-hESCs were pluripotent, chromosomally normal, and matched the NT patient's DNA. The major histocompatibility complex identity of each NT-hESC when compared to the patient's own showed immunological compatibility, which is important for eventual transplantation. With the generation of these NT-hESCs, evaluations of genetic and epigenetic stability can be made. Additional work remains to be done regarding the development of reliable directed differentiation and the elimination of remaining animal components. Before clinical use of these cells can occur, preclinical evidence is required to prove that transplantation of differentiated NT-hESCs can be safe, effective, and tolerated.

AB	DNA sequence and annotation of the entire human chromosome 7, encompassing nearly 158 million nucleotides of DNA and 1917 gene structures, are presented. To generate a higher order description, additional structural features such as imprinted genes, fragile sites, and segmental duplications were integrated at the level of the DNA sequence with medical genetic data, including 440 chromosome rearrangement breakpoints associated with disease. This approach enabled the discovery of candidate genes for developmental diseases including autism.

TI	O-GlcNAc cycling: emerging roles in development and epigenetics.
PG	646-54
AB	The nutrient-sensing hexosamine signaling pathway modulates the levels of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) on key targets impacting cellular signaling, protein turnover and gene expression. O-GlcNAc cycling may be deregulated in neurodegenerative disease, cancer, and diabetes. Studies in model organisms demonstrate that the O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT/Sxc) is essential for Polycomb group (PcG) repression of the homeotic genes, clusters of genes responsible for the adult body plan. Surprisingly, from flies to man, the O-GlcNAcase (OGA, MGEA5) gene is embedded within the NK cluster, the most evolutionarily ancient of three homeobox gene clusters regulated by PcG repression. PcG repression also plays a key role in maintaining stem cell identity, recruiting the DNA methyltransferase machinery for imprinting, and in X-chromosome inactivation. Intriguingly, the Ogt gene resides near the Xist locus in vertebrates and is subject to regulation by PcG-dependent X-inactivation. OGT is also an enzymatic component of the human dosage compensation complex. These 'evo-devo' relationships linking O-GlcNAc cycling to higher order chromatin structure provide insights into how nutrient availability may influence the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. O-GlcNAc cycling at promoters and PcG repression represent concrete mechanisms by which nutritional information may be transmitted across generations in the intra-uterine environment. Thus, the nutrient-sensing hexosamine signaling pathway may be a key contributor to the metabolic deregulation resulting from prenatal exposure to famine, or the 'vicious cycle' observed in children of mothers with type-2 diabetes and metabolic disease.

TI	Effects of maternal obesity on fetal growth and body composition: implications for programming and future health.
PG	113-8
AB	Since the hypothesis linking low birth weight and poor fetal growth with future risk of cardiovascular disease was first proposed, there has been much interest in the early origins of disease. As rates of obesity increase and as maternal obesity has become common, interest has been directed towards the early origins of obesity. It is likely that a complex interaction of inherited gene effects and in-utero environment may interact in the developing fetus to programme pathways leading to future obesity. It is clear that maternal metabolism is disturbed in pregnancy in obese women, and that offspring of obese mothers have a higher percentage of body fat and are insulin resistant. This review discusses the ideas contributing to the current working concept of obesity programming, and discusses several potential mechanisms that may underlie obesity programming and susceptibility to future metabolic and vascular disease.

TI	Intrauterine growth restriction--genetic causes and consequences.
PG	371-8
AB	Intrauterine growth restriction is known to be associated with many medical problems for the baby, both before and after delivery. The mechanisms involved in fetal growth are not well understood, with an increasing range of metabolic diseases being implicated. Several key genes involved in normal embryonic and fetal growth and development are now known to be imprinted. Disruption of this parent-specific mono-allelic expression causes phenotypic changes, many of which are important for growth and development. Two growth disorders, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and Silver-Russell syndrome, are discussed in detail as they represent well-characterized phenotypes that arise as a consequence of disrupted imprinting. These human models will allow us to elucidate key genes and mechanisms important in normal fetal growth.

TI	Assisted reproductive technology, epigenetics, and long-term health: a developmental time bomb still ticking.
PG	409-16
AB	Live birthrates following assisted reproduction account for 1 to 3% of pregnancies in developed countries, and these figures seem set to rise. Concerns regarding the safe use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) for the treatment of infertility have been voiced for several years, yet, to date, the vast majority of children conceived using these techniques are apparently normal. Controversy surrounding reports of epigenetic alterations to genomic imprinting following human ART in recent years has fueled the ongoing debate. In contrast, both the incidence and severity of such anomalies are more apparent following ART in comparative animal species. The reasons for this are not known. By and large, the confounding effects of infertility and advanced maternal age do not apply to animal studies, which report better pregnancy rates following embryo transfer. Perhaps the incidence of imprinting disorders is increased when procedures such as ovarian stimulation, in vitro maturation, or both are used in conjunction with extended periods of embryo culture; this frequently occurs in animal but rarely in human ART. The focus of attention on imprinting, however, may have served to distract the scientific community from more subtle epigenetic modifications to nonimprinted loci in gametes and the preimplantation embryo, with health-related consequences that do not manifest until adulthood. Accumulating evidence from animal studies indicates that such effects, not yet apparent in human subjects, exist; and this may ultimately transpire to be the true developmental legacy of human ART. This article discusses these issues in the context of epigenetic and developmental abnormalities following ART in animals.

TI	Developmental origins of health and disease: brief history of the approach and current focus on epigenetic mechanisms.
PG	358-68
AB	&quot;Barker's hypothesis&quot; emerged almost 25 years ago from epidemiological studies of birth and death records that revealed a high geographic correlation between rates of infant mortality and certain classes of later adult deaths as well as an association between birthweight and rates of adult death from ischemic heart disease. These observations led to a theory that undernutrition during gestation was an important early origin of adult cardiac and metabolic disorders due to fetal programming that permanently shaped the body's structure, function, and metabolism and contributed to adult disease. This theory stimulated interest in the fetal origins of adult disorders, which expanded and coalesced approximately 5 years ago with the formation of an international society for developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD). Here we review a few examples of the many emergent themes of the DOHaD approach, including theoretical advances related to predictive adaptive responses of the fetus to a broad range of environmental cues, empirical observations of effects of overnutrition and stress during pregnancy on outcomes in childhood and adulthood, and potential epigenetic mechanisms that may underlie these observations and theory. Next, we discuss the relevance of the DOHaD approach to reproductive medicine. Finally, we consider the next steps that might be taken to apply, evaluate, and extend the DOHaD approach.

TI	The preimplantation embryo: handle with care.
PG	175-85
AB	The past decade has seen considerable advances in our understanding of intrinsic developmental mechanisms associated with gametogenesis and embryogenesis and accompanying applications in the fields of reproductive medicine, embryonic stem cell biology, and nuclear reprogramming. However, a new focus has recently emerged concerning the homeostatic regulation of embryonic cells, how this is set, and how it may influence the longitudinal progression and optimization of the developmental program and indeed the phenotype of the offspring. Attention has been drawn to the preimplantation stage of development as a sensitive &quot;window&quot; when in vitro and in vivo manipulations, such as culture conditions or maternal diet, may have critical consequences. In this article, we review how changes in environmental conditions, mediated via a range of epigenetic, cellular, and metabolic mechanisms in the preimplantation embryo, may alter the pattern of cell division, gene expression, morphology, and potential. We consider how fetal and postnatal phenotype may become susceptible to the plasticity of the preimplantation embryo and the risks for adult health and physiology.

TI	Epigenetics and assisted reproductive technologies: human imprinting syndromes.
PG	143-52
AB	With the rise in use of assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs), there has been an increased awareness of potential genetic problems that may be initiated or propagated using these techniques. Several population studies have suggested a small but significantly increased risk of imprinting disorders like Angelman syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, and possibly transient neonatal diabetes in children born through ARTs. Although the absolute risk appears to be very small, this association logically leads to the question of how ARTs affect gene imprinting. Studies investigating culture medias, timing of embryo transfer, intracytoplasmic sperm injection, and type of infertility have not yielded an association. There is evidence that the period of gamete development and the period during which imprinted genes must maintain methylation are vulnerable points at which errors may occur. Further evidence linking aberrant methylation to subfertility and superovulation make epigenetics and ARTs an area that requires additional research.

TI	Absence of factor V Arg306--Thr and low factor V Arg306-&gt;Gly mutation prevalence in Thai blood donors.
PG	450-2
AB	Thrombosis among the Thai population is much lower than in western countries. The Thai population is protected to some extent against familial thrombophilia as by the very low prevalence of factor V Leiden, G20210A prothrombin and C677T methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase mutations. The present study reports the prevalence of two mutations of the factor V gene involving the codon for Arg 306 among 500 healthy adult voluntary blood donors (males 285, females 215) and 30 children (boys 20, girls 10) experiencing a total of 36 thrombotic episodes. The blood donors' ages ranged from 18 to 60 years while the children's ages ranged from 9 months to 15 years. The allelic frequencies of the factor V gene mutation of G1091C and A1090G among blood donors were 0% and 0.4%, respectively. Additionally, both mutations were not present in any of the 30 children with thrombosis. The low prevalence of factor V gene mutations in the codon Arg 306 may be relevant to the low rate of thrombosis among the Thai population.

TI	Molecular markers for diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome in thai patients by fish.
PG	881-6
AB	Paternal microdeletion of chromosome 15 at q11-q13 has been reported in 75% of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) patients in western countries. Diagnosis of PWS in Thailand is mainly based on clinical observation and, in some cases, confirmed by conventional cytogenetic analysis. Loss of a tiny segment in this region (microdeletion) has made it difficult to discriminate from the normal karyotype. An attempt to solve this problem has been made by using a high resolution chromosome culture. However, this method is a tedious and time-consuming technique which is suitable for only experienced cytogeneticists. We report molecular cytogenetic analysis for PWS in Thai patients using FISH in addition to standard GTG	banding chromosome analysis. Nine Thai patients clinically diagnosed or with a suspicion of PWS were investigated. The FISH probes consist of the region-specific probes (SNRPN or D15S10 probe) and two chromosome 15-specific control probes (D15Z1 centromeric and PML chromosome 15 long arm probe). Bright field and FISH programs of an automatic karyotyper were applied to facilitate the efficiency of the chromosome analysis. We found that 2 out of 9 patients showed a deletion at 15q11-q13 region by standard GTG chromosome analysis while 4 out of 9 patients showed a delation in this region by FISH. Consistent losing of SNRPN and D15S10 signals in FISH was observed in these patients. This forty-four per cent deletion is considerably lower than those reported from western countries. We propose that DNA methylation at SNRPN promoter as well as structural abnormalities in other chromosome regions might also play a role in the etiology of this disorder in Thais, which should be investigated further.

TI	Relation of candidate genes that encode for endothelial function to migraine and stroke: the Stroke Prevention in Young Women study.
PG	e550-7
AB	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Migraine with aura is a risk factor for ischemic stroke, but the mechanism by which these disorders are associated remains unclear. Both disorders exhibit familial clustering, which may imply a genetic influence on migraine and stroke risk. Genes encoding for endothelial function are promising candidate genes for migraine and stroke susceptibility because of the importance of endothelial function in regulating vascular tone and cerebral blood flow. METHODS: Using data from the Stroke Prevention in Young Women study, a population-based case-control study including 297 women aged 15 to 49 years with ischemic stroke and 422 women without stroke, we evaluated whether polymorphisms in genes regulating endothelial function, including endothelin-1 (EDN), endothelin receptor type B (EDNRB), and nitric oxide synthase-3 (NOS3), confer susceptibility to migraine and stroke. RESULTS: EDN SNP rs1800542 and rs10478723 were associated with increased stroke susceptibility in whites (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1-4.2 and OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1-4.4; P=0.02 and 0.02, respectively), as were EDNRB SNP rs4885493 and rs10507875, (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.7 and OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.4-4.3; P=0.01 and 0.002, respectively). Only 1 of the tested SNP (NOS3 rs3918166) was associated with both migraine and stroke. CONCLUSIONS: In our study population, variants in EDN and EDNRB were associated with stroke susceptibility in white but not in black women. We found no evidence that these genes mediate the association between migraine and stroke.

TI	Promoter polymorphisms in the nitric oxide synthase 3 gene are associated with ischemic stroke susceptibility in young black women.
PG	1848-51
AB	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Endothelial nitric oxide exerts a variety of protective effects on endothelial cells and blood vessels, and therefore the nitric oxide synthase 3 gene (NOS3) is a logical candidate gene for stroke susceptibility. METHODS: We used the population-based Stroke Prevention in Young Women case-control study to assess the association of five NOS3 polymorphisms in 110 cases (46% black) with ischemic stroke and 206 controls (38% black), 15 to 44 years of age. Polymorphisms included 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region (-1468 T&gt;A, -922 G&gt;A, -786 T&gt;C), 1 SNP in exon 7 (G894T), and 1 insertion/deletion polymorphism within intron 4. RESULTS: Significant associations with both the -922 G&gt;A and -786 T&gt;C SNPs with ischemic stroke were observed in the black, but not the white, population. This association was attributable to an increased prevalence of the -922 A allele (OR=3.0, 95% CI=1.3 to 6.8; P=0.005) and the -786 T allele (OR=2.9, 95% CI=1.3 to 6.4; P=0.005) in cases versus controls. These 2 SNPs were in strong linkage disequilibrium (D'=1.0), making it impossible to determine, within the confines of this genetic study, whether 1 or both of these polymorphisms are functionally related to NOS3 expression. Two sets of haplotypes were also identified, 1 of which may confer an increased susceptibility to stroke in blacks, whereas the other appears to be protective. CONCLUSIONS: Promoter variants in NOS3 may be associated with ischemic stroke susceptibility among young black women.

TI	Polymorphisms of coagulation factor XIII subunit A and risk of nonfatal hemorrhagic stroke in young white women.
PG	2580-6
AB	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although family studies have suggested a genetic influence on hemorrhagic stroke, the underlying genetic risk factors remain poorly defined. Coagulation factor XIII, which is involved in hemostasis, fibrinolysis, vascular remodeling, and tissue repair, represents a candidate gene for hemorrhagic stroke. We assessed the potential role of 3 factor XIII subunit A coding-sequence polymorphisms, along with a promoter polymorphism of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1, which is also involved in fibrin stabilization and vascular remodeling), in young white women with hemorrhagic stroke. METHODS: Genotype analysis for factor XIII subunit A Val34Leu, Tyr204Phe, and Pro564Leu and for PAI-1 -675 4G/5G was performed in a population-based case-control study of 42 white women aged &lt;45 years with nonfatal hemorrhagic stroke and 345 demographically similar control subjects. RESULTS: Compared with the respective homozygous wild-type genotypes, the Tyr204/Phe204 genotypes (age-adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.9, 95% 95% CI 1.1 to 7.5) and the Leu564/Leu564 genotype (OR 4.3, 95% CI 1.4 to 13.7) were each associated with an increased risk of nonfatal hemorrhagic stroke. The risk estimate associated with the Phe204 variant was highest in women with subarachnoid hemorrhage and in nonsmokers, whereas the risk estimate of the Leu564/Leu564 genotype was highest in women with intracerebral hemorrhage and in smokers. Women who carried either the Phe204 allele or the Leu564/Leu564 genotype in combination with the PAI-1 5G/5G genotype had a nearly 20-fold increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke (OR 18.9, 95% CI 3.8 to 95.1). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the Phe204 and Leu564 variants of coagulation factor XIII may be markers for genetic susceptibility to hemorrhagic stroke in women aged &lt;45 years.

TI	Association between the Glu298Asp polymorphism in the endothelial constitutive nitric oxide synthase gene and brain infarction. The GENIC Investigators.
PG	1634-9
AB	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Nitric oxide (NO) synthesized by endothelial constitutive NO synthase (ecNOS) plays a key role in vascular regulation and atherosclerosis. Little is known concerning the role of the ecNOS gene (NOS3) as a risk factor for brain infarction (BI). Our aim was to investigate the relation between the Glu298Asp polymorphism in exon 7 of NOS3 with BI and its subtypes. METHODS: Patients (n=460; cases) with BI were consecutively recruited and classified into etiological subtypes. Control subjects (n=460; controls) without a history of stroke were recruited among individuals hospitalized at the same institutions and individually matched on age, sex, and center. Genotypes of the polymorphism were determined by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The distribution of genotypes was significantly different between cases and controls (P=0.008); the GG genotype was more frequent in cases (46.1%) than in controls (35.4%; OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.19 to 2.04). Among subtypes, the frequency of the GG genotype was significantly higher in cases than in controls in the lacunar subtype (OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.05 to 3. 80); in this group, the relation between BI and LDL level was stronger among carriers of the GG genotype than among noncarriers (P for interaction, 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Homozygosity for the G allele of the Glu298Asp polymorphism in NOS3 was associated with BI, and especially with lacunar stroke. Our findings suggest that genetic susceptibility and LDL cholesterol have a synergistic relation. Although these findings should be replicated in a larger sample of subjects and the functionality of the Glu298Asp polymorphism has not been established, these results may help us to understand the cause of the arteriolopathy underlying lacunae and have future implications in their treatment and prevention.

TI	[Genetic determinants of hereditary thrombophilia in pathogenesis of venous thrombosis].
PG	78-80
AB	AIM: To study the role of genetic determinants of hereditary thrombophilia in pathogenesis of various clinical manifestations of venous thrombosis in the citizens of the North-West Region of Russia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Mutations of the genes of factor V (FV Leiden), prothrombin (G20210-A) and polymorphism C677-T in the gene of methylentetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) were detected using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with a following restriction analysis of PCR product in 183 patients with venous thrombosis (115 with isolated thrombosis of the deep veins and 68 with thromboembolism of the pulmonary artery). RESULTS: It was established that mutation FV Leiden is a significant risk factor of deep vein thrombosis in the legs and postthrombotic disease, but this mutation is weakly associated with pulmonary artery thromboembolism (PAT). An essential PAT risk factor is carriage of the variant prothrombin G20210A. CONCLUSION: Determination of prothrombotic genotypes is a key factor of treatment efficacy and prevention of life-threatening thromboembolic complications.

TI	Microsatellites proximal to leptin and leptin receptor as risk factors for spina bifida.
PG	231-5
AB	Several recent studies have observed an association between neural tube defect risk and prepregnant obesity. This association was generally stronger for spina bifida and was observed irrespective of additional maternal factors, including periconceptional intake of vitamin supplements. Other studies have identified mutations within the genes that code for leptin (LEP) and its receptor (LEPR), which have been linked to obesity in mice and humans. We investigated the potential association between nucleotide variation at the LEP and LEPR loci, and increased risk of spina bifida. We searched specifically for allelic association at a pair of highly polymorphic microsatellites closely linked to either the LEP or LEPR gene. Data were derived from a population-based case-control study that had previously identified an association between a woman's prepregnant obesity and her risk of delivering an infant with spina bifida. A total of 56 spina bifida case infants and 126 nonmalformed control infants were genotyped for 10 microsatellite alleles closely linked to the LEP gene, and 49 cases and 125 controls were genotyped for 10 microsatellite alleles closely linked to the LEPR gene. In general, alleles were not observed to be exclusively associated with substantially greater spina bifida risk in the body mass index (BMI) category (obese) of &gt;29 kg/m(2) compared with the BMI category (nonobese) of &lt;/=29 kg/m(2). Thus, these particular infant allelic variants did not appear to explain the previously reported elevated risk observed for women whose prepregnant BMI exceeded 29 kg/m(2). A modest elevated spina bifida risk, irrespective of maternal BMI, was observed for two LEP microsatellite alleles (257 and 271). These estimates, however, were imprecise. Compared with those infants who did not have either of these alleles and whose mother's prepregnant BMI was &lt;/=29 kg/m(2), we computed odds ratios for (1) having either the 257 or 271 allele and maternal BMI &gt;29 kg/m; (2) having either allele and BMI &lt;/=29 kg/m(2); and (3) not having either allele but BMI &gt;29 kg/m(2). The odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for these comparisons were: for allele 257, 4.5 (1.1-19.4), 1.9 (0.5-6.3), and 2.9 (1.3-6.4), respectively, and for allele 271, 6.7 (1.6-30.4), 2.7 (0.7-10.9), and 2.7 (1.2-5.9), respectively. Owing to the exploratory nature of this investigation, the significance of these latter results is unclear.

TI	Short	and long-term adverse effects of cocaine abuse during pregnancy on the heart development.
PG	7-16
AB	The effect of cocaine on the developing fetus is a topic of considerable interest and debate. One of the potential effects of fetal cocaine exposure is damage to the developing heart. This review provides an overview of the current understanding of the short	and long-term effects of fetal cocaine exposure on the heart in both humans and animal models. Human studies are still preliminary but have suggested that fetal cocaine exposure impacts on the developing heart. Studies in animal models provide strong evidence for a programming effect resulting in detrimental long-term changes to the heart induced by fetal cocaine exposure. In the rat model, fetal cocaine results in apoptosis in the term heart, left ventricular remodeling and myocyte hypertrophy, as well as increased sensitivity to ischemia/reperfusion injury in the adult male offspring. The rat model has also shown evidence of epigenetic modifications in response to intrauterine cocaine. Increased DNA methylation of promoter regions leads to a long-term decrease in the expression of the cardioprotective gene, PKCepsilon. The current data shows fetal cocaine exposure has significant immediate and long-term cardiac consequences in animal models and while human studies are still incomplete they suggest this phenomenon may also be significant in humans exposed to cocaine during development.

TI	Early-onset ischaemic stroke: analysis of 58 polymorphisms in 17 genes involved in methionine metabolism.
PG	231-42
AB	The hypothesis underlying this study is that variations in genes involved in methionine metabolism may contribute to genetic susceptibility for early-onset ischaemic stroke. We investigated 58 polymorphisms in AHCY, BHMT, BHMT2, CBS, ENOSF1, FOLH1, MTHFD1, MTHFR, MTR, MTRR, NNMT, PON1, PON2, SLC19A1, SHMT1, TCN2, TYMS genes on genomic DNA from 501 young patients who survived ischaemic stroke and 1,211 sex and age comparable controls. Genotype distribution was significantly different between patients and controls for the following SNPs: rs10037045 BHMT, rs682985 BHMT2, rs1051319 CBS, rs202680 FOLH1, rs2274976 MTHFR, rs1979277 SHMT1, rs20721958 TCN2. On multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted for traditional risk factors, rs10037045 BHMT, rs682985 BHMT2, rs1051319 CBS, and rs202680 FOLH1 remained independent risk factors for stroke. After haplotype reconstruction, generalised linear model analyses adjusted for traditional risk factors and using the FDR multiple testing correction showed significant associations between ischaemic stroke and BHMT, CBS, FOLH1, MTR, PON2, TCN2 and TYMS haplotypes. This study identifies significant genetic associations between premature ischaemic stroke and haplotypes in BHMT, CBS, FOLH1, MTR, PON2, TCN2 and TYMS genes involved in methionine metabolism.

TI	Genetic deletion of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) in APOE3-Leiden mice reduces progression of cholesterol-induced atherosclerosis.
PG	710-6
AB	During recent years it has become increasingly recognized that the plasmin activation system is involved in the development of atherosclerosis. In this paper, we have studied the contribution of the plasminogen activation system in the development of atherosclerosis by cross-breeding apoE3-Leiden mice, which have a human-like lipid profile, with mice deficient in PAI-1 (plasminogen-activator inhibitor-1), u-PA (urokinase plasminogen activator), and t-PA (tissue plasminogen activator). Genetic compound offspring was used to evaluate the progression of atherosclerotic lesions after they were fed a variant atherogenic diet for 12 weeks. Lesion area of plaques in the aortic valve was not significantly different in apoE3-Leiden:PAI -/	and apoE3-Leiden:u-PA -/	mice as compared to apoE3-Leiden mice. In contrast, a significant 70% reduction of the lesion area was observed in apoE3-Leiden:t-PA -/	mice as compared to control group apoE3-Leiden mice. In addition the early, regular fatty streaks and mild plaques increased in apoE3-Leiden:t-PA -/	mice, whereas the severe plaques (type IV and V) decreased in these animals. A lower deposition of collagen was observed in the atherosclerotic lesions of apoE3-Leiden:t-PA -/	mice as compared with apoE3-Leiden mice. Our results indicate for the first time that t-PA deficiency delayed the atherosclerotic process in this mouse model.

TI	The deletion polymorphism in the angiotensin-converting enzyme gene is a moderate risk factor for venous thromboembolism.
PG	847-52
AB	ACE displays potent vasoconstrictive effects, attenuation of fibrinolysis, and platelet activation and aggregation, thus possibly promoting venous thromboembolism (VTE). The ACE gene contains an insertion (I) or deletion (D) polymorphism accounting for 50% of the variation in serum ACE concentration. To evaluate the role of the I/D polymorphism in VTE, its prevalence was determined in 931 patients with VTE and 432 blood donors. The prevalence of the DD genotype was 27.6% in patients and 21.3% in controls (OR 1.4; p &lt; 0.02). In multivariate analysis there was a trend of the DD genotype to be an independent risk factor (OR 1.4; p = 0.08). No differences in DD genotype prevalence according to exogenous risk factors were found. Coinheritance of FV G1691A, PT G20210A mutation, and PS deficiency with the DD genotype increased the relative risk of VTE. Thus, the ACE DD genotype is a moderate risk factor of hereditary thrombophilia. Exogenous risk factors did not alter the manifestation of VTE among carriers of the DD genotype, whereas coinheritance of the DD genotype with the aforementioned defects increased the risk for VTE considerably.

TI	Inherited thrombophilia as a risk factor for the development of ischemic stroke in young adults.
PG	229-33
AB	INTRODUCTION: Several recent studies have analyzed a possible effect of thrombophilia risk factors such as factor V Leiden, the prothrombin variant (allele 20210 A), and homozygosity for thermolabile methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR-T) on the development of ischemic stroke (IS). In the present study, we determined the role of these prothrombotic polymorphisms in the early onset of arterial IS or cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) in a group of young Brazilian adults of Caucasian and African descent. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 167 survivors of IS (153 patients with arterial IS and 14 cases of CVT; 66 men: 101 women; 124 of Caucasian and 43 of African origin; median age: 32.6 years; range: 15 to 45 years) and compared the prevalence of inherited thrombophilia risk factors with a control group of 225 sex and age matched individuals of the same ethnic background. To determine the interaction with atherogenic risk factors, the following diagnoses were considered: hypertension, hyperlipoproteinemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking status and use of oral contraceptives. RESULTS: In the arterial IS group, no significant variation was found between patients and controls of Caucasian origin regarding the prevalence of factor V Leiden (P = 0.92), the prothrombin variant (P = 0.13) or homozygosity for MTHFR-T (P = 0.61). Among Brazilians of African descent, 10.3% were homozygous for MTHFR-T, which was significantly elevated, odds ratio of 5.9 (95% CI: 0.88 to 49.15). In the CVT group, two Caucasian patients (20%) were heterozygous for the prothrombin variant, odds ratio of 9.7 (95% CI: 0.95 to 89.71) and one patient was carrier of factor V Leiden (P = 0.49). No prothrombotic polymorphism was identified in patients with CVT of African descent. All women in the CVT group were in use of oral contraceptives or in the post-partum state. DISCUSSION: Inherited thrombophilia risk factors were not found to increase the risk of arterial IS among young patients of Caucasian descent. However, a potential role of homozygosity for MTHFR-T was observed in a small group of patients of African origin. The analysis of patients with CVT revealed an increased risk due to the prothrombin gene variant or oral contraceptive use. Further studies including all incoming patients with IS are necessary to evaluate the impact of inherited thrombophilia risk factors on early mortality.

TI	The role of vitamin B12 in fasting hyperhomocysteinemia and its interaction with the homozygous C677T mutation of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene. A case-control study of patients with early-onset thrombotic events.
PG	563-70
AB	Total fasting plasma homocysteine (tHcy), homozygosity for the C677T mutation of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene and for the A2756G mutation of the methionine synthase (MS) gene, vitamin B12 and folate plasma levels were evaluated in 170 consecutive patients (89 M, 81 F; mean age 41 +/	12 yrs) with documented early-onset thrombosis (89 venous, 69 arterial, 12 both; mean age at first episode 36 +/	11 yrs), and in 182 age	and sex-matched healthy control subjects. Moderate hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy, tHcy &gt;19.5 microM in men and &gt;15 microM in women) was detected in 45 patients (26.5%) and in 18 controls (9.9%, Mantel-Haenszel OR and 95% C.I. after stratification for arterial or venous thrombosis: 3.25, 1.78-5.91). The 677TT MTHFR genotype was not significantly more prevalent in patients (27.6%) than in controls (21.4%, RR = 1.42: 0.84-2.41), and markedly contributed to HHcy (Mantel-Haenszel RR after stratification for case/control status: 8.29, 4.61-14.9). The 2756GG MS genotype, observed in 4 patients (2.4%) and 8 controls (4.4%), was not associated to HHcy. tHcy was negatively correlated to folate and vitamin B12 levels, with better correlation found in subjects with the 677TT mutation (r = -0.42 and -0.25) than with the 677CC or CT MTHFR genotype (r = 0).37 and -0.11). However, folate was similar in patients and controls and vitamin B12 was higher in patients (460 +/	206 vs. 408 +/-185 pg/ml, p = 0.011). In a generalized linear model, 44% of the variation in tHcy levels was explained by folate and vitamin B12 levels, the MTHFR genotype, gender, and by the interaction of the MTHFR genotype with folate (p &lt; or =0.028); the interactions of vitamin B12 with the MTHFR genotype, gender and patient/control status also significantly contributed to the variation in tHcy levels (p &lt; or =0.028). A 4-week administration of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (15 mg/day) markedly lowered plasma tHcy in 24 patients with MTHFR 677TT genotype, but the response to treatment correlated with vitamin B,2 levels (p = 0.023). Subjects carrying the MTHFR 677TT genotype have higher folate and vitamin B12 requirements irrespective of the A2756G polymorphism of the MS gene. Yet unidentified abnormalities of MS or of any of the enzymes participating in the synthesis of methylated vitamin B12 may play an important role in the phenotypic expression of moderate hyperhomocysteinemia.

AB	To identify whether genotype contributes to the difference in PAI-1 levels in type 1 and type 2 diabetic subjects and whether genotype relates to the development of retinopathy, a Hind III restriction fragment length polymorphism and two dinucleotide repeat polymorphisms were studied. In 519 Caucasian diabetic subjects (192 type 1, 327 type 2) and 123 Caucasian control subjects there were no differences in the frequency of the Hind III restriction alleles (type 1 vs type 2 vs control: allele 1 0.397 vs 0.420 vs 0.448; allele 2 0.603 vs 0.580 vs 0.552) nor in the allelic frequency at either dinucleotide repeat sequence. In 86 subjects with no retinopathy at 15 years or more from diagnosis of diabetes and 190 subjects with diabetic retinopathy there was no difference in the frequency of Hind III restriction alleles (retinopathy present vs retinopathy absent: allele 1 0.400 vs 0.467; allele 2 0.600 vs 0.533) nor in the allelic frequencies at either dinucleotide repeat sequence. The results indicate that there is no or minimal influence of the PAI-1 gene on either PAI-1 levels or the development of diabetic retinopathy in patients with diabetes mellitus.

TI	Prevalence of factor V Leiden, FII G20210A, FXIII Val34Leu and MTHFR C677T polymorphisms in cancer patients with and without venous thrombosis.
PG	171-4
AB	Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common complication in patients with malignant disease. In addition to well-established acquired risk factors for VTE, several genetic risk factors, mainly related to the haemostatic system, are known to influence thrombotic risk. However, the contribution of gene abnormalities to thrombotic tendency in cancer patients remains poorly explored. We performed a prospective study to evaluate the prevalence and clinical significance of four gene variations (factor V Leiden [FVL], factor II G20210A, factor XIII Val34Leu and MTHFR C677T) in cancer patients, with and without VTE. Enrolled were 211 unrelated and unselected patients (M/F ratio 0.5, mean age 57 years, range 12-91 years) with a diagnosis of cancer, admitted to two University Oncology Clinics in the city of Sao Paulo, Southeastern Brazil. After admission, all patients were evaluated for the presence of symptoms and signs of VTE. Sixty-four patients (30.3%) had an episode of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), which has been objectively verified; 147 patients (69.7%) had no evidence of VTE. FVL was found with a frequency of 1.5% and 2.7% in the VTE and non-VTE group, respectively (odds ratio [OR] for VTE 0.6, 95% CI: 0.06-5.3). FII G20210A was found in 1.5% and 1.3% of thrombotic and nonthrombotic patients, respectively, yielding an OR of 1.2 (95% CI: 0.1-13.1). FXIII Val34Leu was detected in 29.6% of the thrombotic patients and in 28.5% of the non-thrombotic patients (OR 1.1, 95% CI: 0.5-2). MTHFR 677T was present in 53.1% and 60.5% of patients with and without thrombosis, respectively (OR 0.8, 95% CI: 0.4-1.4). The present data do not point to an association between the four polymorphisms here investigated and the risk of VTE in cancer patients.

TI	Genetic determinants of fasting and post-methionine hyperhomocysteinemia in patients with retinal vein occlusion.
PG	7-12
AB	INTRODUCTION: Moderate hyperhomocysteinemia is considered a risk factor for both venous and arterial thrombosis. A prevalence of up to 30% of fasting hyperhomocysteinemia has been recently reported in patients with retinal vein occlusion (RVO) whereas conflicting data exist on the role of C677T polymorphism of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene as a risk factor for RVO. No report has been published on cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) 844ins68 polymorphism (another genetic determinant of blood Hcy levels) in RVO patients. Moreover, scarce information is available on the usefulness of measuring homocysteine also after methionine loading to increase the diagnostic efficacy of hyperhomocysteinemia in RVO patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 55 consecutive patients with diagnosis of RVO and 65 matched controls, plasma fasting total homocysteine (Hcy) levels and CBS and MTHFR polymorphisms were evaluated. In patients with normal fasting Hcy levels, post-methionine Hcy levels were determined. RESULTS: Moderate fasting hyperhomocysteinemia was detected in 18/55 patients (32.7%). In the remaining 37 patients, Hcy was measured again post-methionine loading (PML). Only 3/37 (8.1%) patients had PML hyperhomocysteinemia. Thus, the total prevalence of moderate hyperhomocysteinemia in this cohort of RVO patients was 21/55 (38.2%). The prevalence of homozygosity for C677T MTHFR genotype, but not that of heterozygosity for CBS844ins68, was significantly higher in RVO patients than in controls. CONCLUSIONS: Differently from what has been reported for arterial and/or venous thrombosis, a single fasting Hcy measurement is able to detect most of RVO patients (85.7%) with moderate hyperhomocysteinemia. C677T MTHFR, but not CBS 844ins68, genotype may play a role as risk factor for RVO.

TI	Prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia and the MTHFR C677T polymorphism in patients with arterial and venous thrombosis from North Western Russia.
PG	351-6
AB	Conflicting data from Western European and USA population studies led us to investigate hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T polymorphisms and thrombotic disease in North Western Russia. Plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) levels, MTHFR C677T genotype, selected life style determinants and haemostatic factor activity were determined in patients with arterial (n = 33), venous (n = 40), arterial + venous (n = 11) thrombosis and healthy controls (n = 30). We found raised median tHcy levels in all patient groups vs. controls (p &lt; 0.05), with odds ratios (95% CI) for vascular disease among patients with HHcy (defined as &gt; 15 micromol/l) of 3.9 (0.6	14.3), 4.8 (1.2	18.8) and 15.8 (2.8	87.3) respectively. tHcy levels were a function of MTHFR C677T genotype, and all patients with tHcy levels &gt; 30 micromol/l had the MTHFR C677T homozygous substitution. Elevated tHcy levels (p &lt; 0.05) were identified in smokers and coffee drinkers, with the degree of elevation dependent on MTHFR C677T genotype. Of the studied haemostatic parameters increased factor VIII activity and vWF antigen and activity was observed in HHcy subjects. We conclude that HHcy and MTHFR C677T genotype are positively associated with arterial and venous thrombotic disease in the population of North Western Russia.

TI	Hyperhomocysteinemia and venous thromboembolism: a risk factor more prevalent in the elderly and in idiopathic cases.
PG	121-5
AB	Fasting plasma homocysteine level and the related clinical findings were analysed in 240 consecutive patients with venous thromboembolism. Hyperhomocysteinemia, defined as a plasma level above 20 micromol/l (corresponding to the percentile 95th in the controls), was present in 11.2% of the patients. Plasma homocysteine level was similar in patients presenting with either deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism or both conditions. It was significantly higher in patients with primary (unprovoked) VTE than in patients with secondary disease (associated with at least one risk factor): 12.3 vs. 9.55 micromol/l (p &lt; 0.005). Mean homocysteine was higher in male than in female patients (14.51 vs. 12.9 micromol/l, p &lt; 0.05) and increased significantly with age. Hyperhomocysteinemia was more frequent in patients with relapsing disease (14 of 76, 18.4%) than in those presenting with a single episode (13 of 164, 7.9%) (p = 0.034). Furthermore, hyperhomocysteinemia was correlated with reduced protein C level (p = 0.013). In a multivariate analysis, two factors were significantly associated with hyperhomocysteinemia: older age (p &lt; 0.0001) and idiopathic occurrence (p &lt; 0.02). Since the frequency of homozygous MTHFR thermolabile variant was rather similar in patients and controls, testing for C677T mutation was not helpful in screening VTE patients. However, the homozygous mutation was significantly more prevalent among hyperhomocysteinemia patients, confirming its role in the genesis of hyperhomocysteinemia. According to its prevalence, to the putative role in venous and arterial disease and the availability of an effective and low-cost corrective therapy, hyperhomocysteinemia deserves interest, especially in the elderly and in the patients with idiopathic VTE disease.

TI	Effect of polymorphism in insulin locus and HLA on type 1 diabetes in four ethnic groups in Israel.
PG	33-8
AB	This study examined a possible association of the insulin (INS) gene with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in patients and controls from four ethnic groups in Israel. We analyzed the distribution of -23HphI single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) T/A alleles that correspond to INS variable number of tandem repeat short class I alleles (26-63 repeats) and class III alleles (141-209 repeats), respectively. The -23HphI T/T genotype was found to be positively associated with T1D in three Jewish groups (Yemenites: 93.9% patients vs 68.8% controls, P = 0.0002; Ashkenazi: 80.6% vs 50.8%, P &lt; 10(-4); Ethiopians: 75% vs 40.5%, P = 0.002). The Yemenite healthy controls have the highest frequency of T allele from all Jewish groups studied (83.5% vs 68.8% in Ashkenazi and 64.3% in Ethiopians). The high frequency of a susceptibility allele in the Yemenites is in line with the high incidence of T1D in this population. No association was observed between T1D and the INS gene in Israeli Arabs studied (70.6% vs 66.7%). Variable incidence of T1D among different ethnicities in Israel is largely attributed to heterogeneous genetics. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) results of our previous studies describing the susceptibility and protective haplotypes were used for combined analysis to determine possible interaction between the HLA and INS loci. Only in the Ashkenazi group such interaction was presented with statistical significance.

TI	Association and interaction of the TNF-alpha gene with other pro	and anti-inflammatory cytokine genes and HLA genes in patients with type 1 diabetes from North India.
PG	557-67
AB	Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a multifactorial autoimmune disorder where major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes and the insulin-linked polymorphic region have been shown to play major roles. We report here an integrated effect of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha with other cytokine genes. The TNF-alpha-308 GA and AA (high secretor) polymorphisms were significantly increased in the patients with T1D (n = 235) [P &lt; 7 x 10(-6), odds ratio (OR) = 3.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.8-5.3] compared with the controls (n= 128). The variants of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) (A(+874)T), interleukin (IL)-6 (G(-174)C), IL-10 (A(-1082)G, T(-819)C, C(-592)A) and transforming growth factor (TGF) beta1 (T(cdn10)C, G(cdn25)C) did not show a significant difference between patients and controls. However, simultaneous presence of TNF-alpha-308 GA+AA along with both high and low secretor genotypes of IFN-gamma (P &lt; 0.003) was significantly increased in patients. Simultaneous presence of TNF-alpha-308 GA + AA along with high secretor genotypes of IL-6 (P &lt; 0.0001, OR = 2.61, 95% CI = 1.5-4.56), IL-10 (P &lt; 0.0001, OR = 4.26, 95% CI = 1.9-10.1) and TGF-beta1 (P &lt; 0.00004, OR = 2.8, 95% CI = 1.6-4.86) was also significantly increased in patients with T1D. Low secretor genotype of TNF-alpha-308 GG along with low secretor genotypes of IFN-gamma (P &lt; 0.001, OR = 0.465, 95% CI = 0.28-0.77), high secretor genotypes of IL-6 (P &lt; 0.000004, OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.227-0.621) and TGF-beta1 (P &lt; 0.000006, OR = 0.336, 95% CI = 0.198-0.568) was protective. The TNF-alpha-308 G allele was in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*0801-DRB1*0301 haplotype, while TNF-alpha-308 A allele was in LD with the HLA-B*5001-DRB1*0301 and B*5801-DRB1*0301 haplotypes, suggesting that the effect of TNF-alpha -308 A allele is not because of its being in LD with any HLA alleles, but because of its functional role and its integrated effect with other cytokines.

TI	Insulin gene VNTR, CTLA-4 +49A/G and HLA-DQB1 alleles distinguish latent autoimmune diabetes in adults from type 1 diabetes and from type 2 diabetes group.
PG	121-7
AB	Recent research has underlined the need to explore pathogenic, genetic and clinical spectrum of adult onset autoimmune diabetes, also known as latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). We aimed to investigate whether genetic factors that are associated with type 1 diabetes (T1D) susceptibility, namely HLA-DQB1 alleles, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 gene (CTLA-4) and insulin gene (INS) polymorphisms, are also associated with an atypical subset of patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The case-control study included 70 T1D, 305 T2D and 252 nondiabetic controls. The T2D group was divided into atypical T2D (LADA, n = 61) or typical T2D (n = 244) subgroups based on the presence of at least one pancreas-specific antibody. Our data suggested that HLA-DQB1 alleles of all three risk classes, INS variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) I/I and CTLA-4 +49 GG or AG genotypes, were independent risk factors for developing LADA and could be used as a diagnostic tool to discriminate between LADA and T2D. Additionally, there was an increased association between LADA and CTLA-4 diabetes-susceptibility genotypes and decreased association with INS VNTR and high-risk HLA-DQB1 alleles, compared with T1D. Our study suggested the need for further investigation into the genetic background and functional genomics of LADA in comparison with T1D and T2D.

TI	Insulin-like growth factor 1 promoter polymorphism influences insulin gene variable number of tandem repeat-associated risk for juvenile onset type 1 diabetes.
PG	568-71
AB	Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) plays an important role in the development and function of pancreatic beta-cells and contributes to infant growth, which we recently reported to be associated with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Here, we studied an IGF1 microsatellite in 206 families with T1D and its interaction with the polymorphism near the insulin (INS) gene variable number of tandem repeats. The IGF1 microsatellite was associated with T1D (P = 0.045), which was mainly caused by a protective effect of the 194 bp allele (36% transmission to affected offspring). Interestingly, co-segregation of this IGF1 194 bp allele affected the risk of INS alleles. These results provide the first evidence for an association of IGF1 with T1D and imply that co-inheritance of these functional genetic variants of IGF1 and insulin predispose to T1D.

TI	Molecular basis of predisposition to develop type 1 diabetes mellitus in North Indians.
PG	145-55
AB	Type 1 diabetes (T1D) mellitus is a multifactorial autoimmune disease where more than 90% of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells are destroyed before the clinical manifestations, warranting a need to identify the children predisposed to get the disease. Of the 20 genomic intervals implicated for the risk to develop T1D, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region on chromosome 6p21.31 (IDDM1) has been the major contributor, followed by 5' regulatory region of the insulin (INS) gene on chromosome 11p15.5 (IDDM2). MHC has a role in antigen presentation and IDDM2 has been shown to have a role in transcription of insulin in the thymus. Hence, alleles of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1, DQB1, and insulin-linked variable number of tandem repeats (INS-VNTR) were studied in 110 T1D patients and 112 healthy controls using polymerase chain reaction and hybridization with sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes (PCR-SSOP) and PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), respectively. HLA-DRB1*0301 was significantly increased in the T1D patients along with associated DQB1*0201 followed by DRB1*0401 and DRB1*0405. DRB1*0701 was observed to be the most protective allele followed by DRB1*0403 and DRB1*0404. Although DQB1*0302 which is associated with both the protective and susceptible DR4 alleles was not significantly increased, heterozygous DQB1*0201, *0302 was significantly increased in the TID patients. Because INS-VNTR class I homozygosity was also significantly increased in the patients, simultaneous presence of DRB1*0301 along with homozygous INS-VNTR class I, gave a relative risk (RR) of 70.81. However, a similar analysis of DQB1*0201 and *0302 along with INS-VNTR alleles did not give such high RRs. Thus, the two independently assorting alleles at two loci i.e., DRB1*0301 and INS-VNTR class I, on two different chromosomes may have the potential to predict a prediabetic in North India.

TI	Susceptible locus for obese type 2 diabetes mellitus in the 5'-flanking region of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene.
PG	449-52
AB	We have identified three novel polymorphisms in the promoter/enhancer region of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha gene. In this study we investigated the role of the polymorphisms in predisposition to Type 2 diabetes. The allele frequency of C--&gt;T substitution at -857 tended to be higher in obese patients with diabetes than in lean subjects with normal glucose tolerance (0280 vs. 0.190). This tendency was due to a significantly higher ratio of -857T homozygotes in the obese patients with diabetes (15%) than in lean subjects with normal glucose tolerance (4%). There was no significant association between polymorphisms at positions -863 or -1,013, and diabetes. The homozygous -857T allele may be associated with genetic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in obese subjects.

TI	HLA and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) polymorphisms in ocular Behcet's disease.
PG	264-72
AB	The role of HLA-B*51 and other major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes in Behcet's disease (BD) remains unknown. We have performed HLA and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) polymorphism analysis in BD and evaluated their contribution to ocular disease. In this study, 102 patients and 115 controls of Middle Eastern descent were investigated by HLA and B*51 subtyping using novel primers, and by LT alpha NCo 1 and TNF 308 promoter polymorphism analysis. The frequency of the HLA-B*51 family of alleles was raised in patients compared to controls (66% vs. 15%, Pc=2.5x10(-12), OR=10.9). The odds ratio (OR) of this group of alleles for subgroups of patients was as follows: non-ocular patients 7.8, all ocular patients 12.6, blind patients &gt;22. HLA-B*51 subtyping detected B*5101, 07, 08 and 09 alleles, with a similar frequency among patients and controls. HLA-Cw*1602 was associated with B*5108, but was not an independent risk factor for disease. The LT alpha (TNFB*2) allele was associated with HLA-B*51 among patients and the frequency of this allele was significantly higher among completely blind patients compared to both non-ocular patients (P=0.048, OR &gt;3.6) and to healthy controls (P=0.022, OR &gt;4.3). The rare TNF-2 polymorphism at the TNF -308 promoter position was associated with HLA-B*50 (not B*51), and was not associated with BD. Thus, in this population the HLA*B51 family of alleles is a strong risk factor for BD, and in particular the development of ocular disease. HLA-B*51 subtyping did not define new markers for BD. A primary role for TNF gne polymorphisms in BD was not identified, but co-expression of the TNFB*2 allele with HLA-B*51 may contribute to severity of ocular disease.

TI	Genetic variations within the insulin gene region are associated with accelerated fetal growth.
PG	27-34
AB	Size at birth has been proposed to be associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease later in life. It is, however, unclear whether this association is attributed to an unfavorable intrauterine environment or to specific genotypes predisposing both altered fetal growth and common diseases in adult life. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between the neonatal birth size and the genotypes of polymorphic loci within the insulin gene (INS) region, which is susceptible to diabetes mellitus. We analyzed the genotypes of two polymorphic loci; -23HphI and HUMTH01, in 520 pairs of normal Japanese mothers and their neonates, and compared with the somatoscopic characteristics at birth converted into standard deviation scores (SDS) according to sex, parity and gestational weeks at delivery. It was revealed that neonatal -23HphI T allele and HUMTH01 allele10, which are linked to the INS variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) class III allele, were associated with increased weight, head circumstance, and length at birth. These associations confirmed that variation within the INS region, most probably at the INS-VNTR, influences fetal growth. Furthermore, the finding that the paternally transmitted -23HphI T allele was exclusively correlated with increased size at birth indicates the involvement of an imprinting mechanism. In conclusion, the INS-VNTR class III allele might accelerate fetal growth in a parent-specific manner.

TI	Epigenetic priming of the metabolic syndrome.
PG	353-61
AB	The metabolic syndrome (MetS) represents a cluster of cardiometabolic risk factors, including central obesity, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, hyperinsulinemia and microalbuminuria, and more recently, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and atherosclerosis. Although the concept of the MetS is subject to debate due to lack of a unifying underlying mechanism, the prevalence of a metabolic syndrome phenotype is rapidly increasing worldwide. Moreover, it is increasingly prevalent in children and adolescents of obese mothers. Evidence from both epidemiological and experimental animal studies now demonstrates that MetS onset is increasingly likely following exposure to suboptimal nutrition during critical periods of development, as observed in maternal obesity. Thus, the developmental priming of the MetS provides a common origin for this multifactorial disorder. Consequently, the mechanisms leading to this developmental priming have recently been the subject of intensive investigation. This review discusses recent data regarding the epigenetic modifications resulting from nutrition during early development that mediate persistent changes in the expression of key metabolic genes and contribute toward an adult metabolic syndrome phenotype. In addition, this review considers the role of the endogenous molecular circadian clock system, which has the potential to act at the interface between nutrient sensing and epigenetic processing. A continued and greater understanding of these mechanisms will eventually aid in the identification of individuals at high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes, and help develop therapeutic interventions, in accordance with current global government strategy.

TI	Impact of thrombophilic gene mutations and graft-versus-host disease on thromboembolic complications after allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation.
PG	911-8
AB	BACKGROUND: Hemostatic events in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) increase the morbidity and mortality in this cohort. Little is known about the impact of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) or of thrombophilic gene mutations/polymorphisms on these complications. STUDY DESIGN: Eighty-nine allogeneic stem-cell recipients and their donors were evaluated prospectively for the presence of the factor V G1691A mutation, the prothrombin G20210A mutation, the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate-reductase (MTHFR) C677T mutation, the glycoprotein IIIa PI(a1/a2) polymorphism, the fibrinogen-beta-chain 455G/A polymorphism, the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 -675 4G/5G polymorphism, and the angiotensin-converting enzyme intron 16 I/D polymorphism. These mutations/polymorphisms and GvHD parameters were correlated to hemostatic and toxic complications after transplantation. The data were compared with those of 128 healthy controls. RESULTS: The PAI-1 4G/4G polymorphism increases the risk for catheter thrombosis after HSCT 5.7-fold (32.2% vs. 71.4%, P&lt;0.05). In patients with hepatic veno-occlusive disease, the frequency of the PAI-1 4G allele is also increased (83.3% vs. 55.1%, NS). Thrombophilic mutations/polymorphisms in donors do not influence complications in the corresponding recipients. The MTHFR TT genotype does not modify severity and duration of mucositis and aplasia in patients receiving methotrexate prophylaxis. Patients with chronic GvHD have a higher risk of thromboembolism (12.9% vs. 1.7%, P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: Thrombophilic gene mutations have only a moderate influence on hemostatic complications in patients undergoing HSCT. This may be because of the overwhelming immunologic impact of GvHD on hemostasis in the allogeneic transplantation setting.

TI	Imprinting in Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes.
PG	194-200
AB	Imprinted genes are marked in the germline and retain molecular memory of their parental origin, resulting in allelic expression differences during development. Abnormalities in imprinted inheritance occur in several genetic diseases and cancer, and are exemplified by the diverse genetic defects involving chromosome 15q11-q13 in Prader-Willi (PWS) and Angelman (AS) syndromes. PWS involves loss of function of multiple paternally expressed genes, while mutations in a single gene, UBE3A, which is subject to spatially restricted imprinting, occur in some AS patients. Identification of mutations in the imprinting process in PWS and AS has led to a definition of an imprinting center (IC), involving the promoter (in PWS) or an alternative transcript of the SNRPN gene (in AS). The IC regulates initiation of imprint switching for all genes in a 2 Mb imprinted domain during gametogenesis. Imprinting mutations define a novel mechanism of genetic disease because they have no direct effect in the affected patient but, rather, it is the parental germline effect of an IC mutation that leads to disease in the offspring.

TI	Epigenetic mechanisms of perinatal programming of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function and health.
PG	269-77
AB	Environmental effects on the materno-foetal interaction determine birth outcomes that predict health over the lifespan. Thus, maternal undernutrition or stress associate with low birth weight, leading to an increased risk of metabolic and cardiovascular illness in the offspring. We argue that these effects are, in part, mediated by direct and indirect effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis such that (i) the effect of maternal adversity on foetal growth is mediated by adrenal glucocorticoids and (ii) environmental adversity alters maternal physiology and behaviour, which then programs HPA activity in the offspring.

TI	HNF-4alpha: from MODY to late-onset type 2 diabetes.
PG	521-4
AB	Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a rare subtype of type 2 diabetes that is characterized by autosomal-dominant inheritance and can be caused by mutations in hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF-4alpha). Odom and colleagues have combined chromatin immunoprecipitation with promoter microarrays to identify numerous promoters occupied by HNF-4alpha in the human liver and islet, suggesting a very broad role for HNF-4alpha in glucose homeostasis. This notion is supported by recent genetic studies linking HNF-4alpha to the much more common late-onset type 2 diabetes.

TI	Effects of angiotensinogen and angiotensin II type I receptor genes on blood pressure and left ventricular mass trajectories in multiethnic youth.
PG	393-402
AB	The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of variations of the angiotensinogen (AGT) and angiotensin II type I receptor (AGTR1) genes on progression of blood pressure (BP) and left ventricular mass (LVM) in multiethnic youth. The study was longitudinal involving 581 European American (EA) and African American (AA) youth with 12 assessments over a 15-year period. AGT M235T and three AGTR1 polymorphisms (C-521T, L191L and A1166C) were genotyped and individual growth curve modeling analyses were conducted. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analyses found a significant 3-way interaction between M235T, ethnicity and gender on BP levels. Systolic BP (SBP) levels were 5.8 mmHg (p = .00003) and diastolic BP (DBP) levels were 2.6 mmHg (p = .005) lower in carriers versus noncarriers of the M235 allele in AA males only. Furthermore, the AGTR1 L191 allele showed a SBP lowering effect in subjects with a high socioeconomic status (SES;p = .048) and a DBP lowering effect in AAs (p = .038). Haplotype analyses identified a protective haplotype (C-521, 191L and A1166) for LVM levels (p = .03). LVM in individuals homozygous for this haplotype was 12.9 g lower than those homozygous for the most common haplotype (-521T, 191L and A1166). No significant interactions were found between the AGT M235T polymorphism and any of the single SNPs or haplotypes of the AGTR1 gene. Our results in multiethnic youth uncover an ethnicity and gender-specific effect of the AGT M235T polymorphism and a SES or ethnicity-specific effect of the AGTR1 L191L polymorphism on the progression of hypertension risk. A protective AGTR1 haplotype for LVM was also identified.

TI	DNA hypomethylation and methyltransferase expression in atherosclerotic lesions.
PG	5-11
AB	Arterial smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration and proliferation are central features in atherogenesis. Altered gene expression and cell proliferation in atherosclerotic lesions have some similar characteristics with certain solid tumors and thus might have similar mechanisms that lead to SMC proliferation. Among cancer cells common features are genome-wide hypomethylation which correlates with transformation and tumor progression, and coincident overexpression of methyltransferase (MTase). The purpose of the present study was to analyze whether alterations in DNA methylation and MTase expression are present in atherosclerotic lesions. A significant reduction in genomic 5-methylcytosine content was detected in advanced human atherosclerotic lesions and in lesions of ApoE knock-out mice. SMC were shown to develop hypomethylation in vitro during transformation from a contractile to synthetic phenotype. Balloon denudation of New Zealand White rabbit aorta caused proliferation of intimal SMC with concomitant genomic hypomethylation in the thickened intima. By using in situ hybridization the overall transcriptional activity was found to be increased in clusters of lesion SMC. Marked heterogeneity was seen in MTase mRNA expression in various types of atherosclerotic lesions among intimal and medial SMC. These findings show that (1) genomic hypomethylation occurs during atherogenesis in human, mouse and rabbit lesions and that it correlates with increased transcriptional activity; (2) MTase is expressed in atherosclerotic lesions; and (3) hypomethylation is present in advanced lesions at the same level as in malignant tumors and may affect cellular proliferation and gene expression in atherosclerotic lesions.

TI	[Molecular genetic aspects of arrhythmias].
PG	768-72
AB	The sequencing of human genome was completed in 2001. The position of particular DNA base is established-i.e. we know all &quot;letters&quot; in the &quot;book&quot; but we understand only limited number of &quot;words&quot; i. e. only limited number of genes was identified. And the human genome consists of about 30,000 genes from which through the mechanism of alternative RNA splicing more than 100,000 genes can be derived. All the genes of one individual form the genotype. The expression of genotype in particular environment forms the phenotype. What is not present in genotype can neither be present in phenotype. In the last decade a substantial progress was achieved in understanding of membrane processes mostly due to research of relatively rare inherited monogenous arrhythmic syndromes--first of all the long QT syndrome. It is caused by mutations in ion channel genes and it provides a model of arrhythmogenesis on molecular level. Ventricular arrhythmias are important cause of mortality in patients with cardiovascular diseases. New studies have provided strong evidence for familial sudden cardiac death (SCD) aggregation and therefore also genetic influence. Parental history of SCD increases the relative risk of SCD for offspring to 1.8. In the case of both maternal and paternal SCD events the risk for offspring is a remarkable 9.4. There are 3 pathways by which genetic variation may contribute to risk for SCD: 1. alterations in electrogenesis and conduction, 2. formation and stability of atherosclerotic plaque, thrombogenesis and ischemia within the coronary circulation, 3. control of myocardial excitability and vascular motorics. The main objective of both today and future research is identification of inheritable &quot;molecular&quot; risk factors of arrhythmias. Understanding of this level of pathophysiological processes will subsequently lead to new generation of both diagnostic and therapeutic methods.

TI	[The mechanism of TBX5 abnormal expression in simple congenital heart disease].
PG	374-80
AB	To explore the mechanism of TBX5 abnormal expression in simple congenital heart disease (CHD), 100 CHD venous blood, 50 CHD heart tissues, and 5 non-CHD heart tissues were involved in this study. The mutation and methylation in the 1 200 bp region upstream of TBX5 gene were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease (MS-RE), respectively. The binding site of NKX2-5 to Tbx5 predicted by P-MATCH software was validated by EMSA (Electrophoretic mobility shift assay). Tbx5 gene expression in mouse cardiac muscle cell H9C2(2-1) transfected with NKX2-5 expression vector was evaluated. No mutation was found in all patients. Both non-CHD and CHD heart tissues had the same methylation in the two CpG islands. Exogenous Nkx2-5 efficiently activated the transcription of the endogenous Tbx5 gene in H9C2 (2-1) cells. EMSA showed that the special binding band appeared when Nkx2-5 existed. These results indicates that the down expression of TBX5 might not be caused by mutation and methylation in the 1 200 bp region upstream of gene, and might be regulated by abnormal expression of NKX2-5 gene in heart muscle of CHD.

TI	[Diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome by methylation-specific PCR].
PG	485-8
AB	OBJECTIVE: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex, multisystem disorder, which is difficult to be diagnosed based on clinical symptoms and the purpose of this study is to establish methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR) assay for the diagnosis of PWS, and evaluate its use in clinical cases. MS-PCR assay has been developed abroad for 10 years, and it is efficient, fast, specific and sensitive but it has not yet been used in clinical diagnosis in our country. METHODS: Forty-four subjects were assigned to 3 groups: normal controls (n=16), typical PWS patients (n=7) and suspected PWS patients (n=21). Genome DNA was extracted by salt fractionation method and treated with CpGemone Fast Modification Kit. Using unmodified genome DNA as system control, the modified DNA was amplified by PCR with two primer pairs (M and P), and separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: All normal controls showed both 174 bp (M) and 100 bp (P) products, while all of the seven typical PWS patients demonstrated only 174 bp (M) product. In the 21 suspected patients, two cases were confirmed with PWS by MS-PCR, while others were excluded from PWS. CONCLUSIONS: MS-PCR appears to be a specific, efficient and convenient assay for the diagnosis of PWS.

TI	[The study of mutation in exon 17 of insulin receptor gene in essential hypertensive pedigrees].
PG	83-8
AB	Using the molecular scanning technique of single-stranded conformational polymorphism, we examined the exon 17 of the insulin receptor (INSR) gene in 44 subjects of 6 essential hypertensive pedigrees and 2 normotensive pedigrees. In addition the serum levels of glucose and insulin during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT); blood lipid, and plasma angiotension II and angiotensinogen were done on these pedigrees. Upon direct sequence analysis, 5 individuals were found a single nucleotide substitution at the codon 1058 (CAC--&gt;CAT), which didn't change the amino acid sequence. Among the five individuals 4 of them were from the families with history of hypertension, only one was from normotensive pedigree. Compared with those without the mutation, the individuals with the mutation had a lower ratio of fasting blood glucose to fasting serum insulin level (P &lt; 0.01) and an elevated plasma Ang II concentration. (There was no significant difference, P &gt; 0.05, probably due to the mutant cases which we studied were small). Thus, we conjectured that the mutation in codon 1,058 of the INSR gene might be related with the insulin resistance in hypertensive patients and subjects with the positive hypertensive history.

TI	[Prader-Willi syndrome and genomic imprinting].
PG	453-6
AB	OBJECTIVE: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is an example of a human genetic disorder that involves imprinting genes on the proximal long arm of chromosome 15 and SNRPN gene as a candidate gene for this syndrome. The purpose of this study was to show the molecular genetic defects and genomic imprinting basis in Chinese PWS patients and to evaluate the clinical applications of a differential diagnostic test for PWS. METHODS: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and methylation-specific PCR (MSPCR) techniques were applied for 4 clinically suspected PWS patients. Using three probes, including SNRPN probe for identification of the critical locus in PWS region, D15Z1 and PML control probes for identification of the 15p arm and 15q arm, the authors detected the deletions 15q in PWS. MSPCR was based on sodium bisulfite treatment of DNA and PCR primers specific for the maternal and paternal allele. RESULTS: When hybridized with mixed probes, it was found in 2 patients that the central specific signal was absent, but both the flanking control signals were retained, indicating SNRPN gene deletion of chromosome 15q11-13. Bisulfite-modified DNA from all PWS children amplified with methylated allele-specific primer pair showed only maternal 131bp PCR product, indicating the maternal uniparental disomy (UPD15). CONCLUSION: Genomic imprinting plays an important role in the molecular pathogenesis of PWS that caused by paternal microdeletions of 15q11-q13 or maternal UPD of chromosome 15. The basic defect seemed to be an absence of function of PWS genes that are normally expressed only from the paternal chromosome 15. MSPCR is a rapid and simple PCR-based assay compared with other cyto-molecular tests and its results were consistent with the clinical diagnosis of PWS, so it seems to be a reliable diagnostic method for PWS patients who show abnormal methylation at SNRPN. The genetic differential tests for PWS are important in determining familial recurrence risk.

TI	[The correlation between Kawasaki disease and polymorphisms of Tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-10 gene promoter].
PG	598-602
AB	OBJECTIVE: Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute febrile vasculitic syndrome of unknown etiology that preferentially affects coronary artery. It has been suggested that proinflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) are key players during acute KD. Recently, the polymorphisms relative to major transcriptional start site of TNF-alpha and IL-10 gene were shown to influence the level of TNF-alpha and IL-10 production in vitro. This study was aimed to investigate the genetic association of TNF-alpha and IL-10 promoter polymorphisms in juvenile patients of Han nationality with KD, and to investigate the possible associations with clinical manifestations of the disease. METHODS: Four polymorphism sites of TNF-alpha and IL-10 gene promoter regions from 96 children with KD were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). One hundred and sixty age-matched normal children of the Han nationality were used as control. All patients accepted Doppler echocardiography examination in order to differentiate coronary artery lesions. RESULTS: There was significant difference in allele frequencies of -308 (A/G) site of the TNF-alpha gene between children of the Han nationality and those of Japanese and Caucasian in America. There were significant differences in the allele frequencies of -1082 (G/A), -819 (C/T) and -592 (A/C) of IL-10 gene between children of the Han nationality and their British Counterparts (P &lt; 0.01). There was no significant difference in allele frequencies of -308 (A/G) site of TNF-alpha gene between children with KD and normal controls. There was no significant difference in the haplotypes and the allele frequencies of the above three sites of IL-10 between the two groups. However, when clinical features were examined, the genotype frequency of TNF-alpha-308A was significantly higher in IVIG-resistant KD patients than that of TNF-alpha-308G genotype (67% vs 5%, chi(c)(2) = 90.48, P &lt; 0.01). The genotype of TNF-alpha-308A was closely associated with IVIG-resistant KD (P &lt; 0.01, relative risk 42.25, 95% confidence interval 15.81-112.88). The haplotype frequency of IL-10 -1082A/-819T/-592A was also higher in patients with coronary artery lesion (CAL) caused by KD than those of Non-ATA haplotype (52% vs 20%, chi(2) = 18.36, P &lt; 0.01). The haplotypes of IL-10 -1082A/-819T/-592A was significantly associated with CAL caused by KD (P &lt; 0.01, relative risk 4.26, 95% confidence interval 2.20-8.25). CONCLUSION: The genotype of TNF-alpha-308A is one of the important factors that probably influence the therapeutic effect of KD. The haplotypes (-1082/-819/-592) of IL-10 gene promoter might be related to the pathogenesis of coronary artery complication of KD and -1082A/-819T/-592A haplotypes might be regarded as a genetic marker of risk factor for coronary artery lesion in KD.

TI	[Genotype discrepancy between maternal and fetal Pro12Ala polymorphism of PPARG2 gene and its association with gestational diabetes mellitus].
PG	170-3
AB	OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the influence of fetal genotype in both non-diabetic gravidas and pregnant women on gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) through analysis of the genotype discrepancy between maternal and fetal Pro12Ala single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 2 (PPARG2) genes. METHODS: Pregnant women, who delivered in the Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University from October 2005 to February 2007, and their newborn babies were selected, and were divided into GDM and control group. The GDM group consisted of 55 gravidas with GDM and 40 newborns born to the GDM mothers, and the control group consisted of 173 healthy gravidas and their 50 neonates. Polymerase chain reaction-denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography was applied to detect the distribution of PPARG2 Pro12Ala alleles in all subjects. The concentrations of plasma fasting blood sugar (FBS) and several bio-markers of lipids, including total cholesterol, triglyceride, apoprotein A, high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein, were also tested for the mothers. RESULTS: (1) No significant difference was found in the frequencies of Pro/Pro genotype between the GDM mothers and control mothers (94.6% vs 90.8%, P &gt; 0.05), nor between the GDM offspring and control offspring (95.0% vs 94.0%, P &gt; 0.05) or between the GDM mothers and GDM offspring (P &gt; 0.05). The same was shown in the frequencies of Pro/Ala genotype both between the GDM mothers and control mothers (5.5% vs 9.2%, P &gt; 0.05) and between the GDM offspring and control offspring (2.5% vs 3.0%, P &gt; 0.05). (2) Within both GDM and control group, the maternal FBS and various lipids concentrations of Pro/Pro genotype gravidas showed no significant difference compared to those of Pro/Ala genotype mothers (P &gt; 0.05). (3) Based on the four possible PPARG2 genotype pairs between the mothers and fetuses, Pro/Pro mother and her Pro/Pro fetus, Pro/Ala mother and her Pro/Ala fetus, Pro/Ala mother and her Pro/Pro fetus, and Pro/Pro mother and her Pro/Ala fetus, less Pro/Pro pairs and more Pro/Ala pairs were found in the GDM group than in the control (72.5% vs 92.0%, P = 0.014; 27.5% vs 6.0%, P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Neither the maternal nor the offspring's Pro/Ala genotypes is associated with the genesis of GDM. However, the discrepancy of PPARG2 Pro12Ala polymorphism between mother and her fetus implies a possible cause of GDM.

PG	309-14
AB	OBJECTIVE: To study the mechanism of marcosomia by investigating insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF(2))imprinting status, expression level and the promoter usage in the placenta of macrosomia. METHODS: We selected heterozygous cases for Apa I polymorphism in exon 9 of IGF(2) gene and then analyzed its imprinting status in 168 placentas of macrosomia and normal pregnancies. IGF(2) transcription levels and promoter usages in macrosomic and normal placenta were evaluated by using semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay. RESULTS: Thirty specimens of macrosomic placenta and 30 of normal placenta were identified as heterozygous for IGF(2). All of the heterozygous specimens showed maintenance of imprinting. The expression of placental IGF(2) mRNA (2.2 +/	1.2) was significantly higher in macrosomia than that of normal weight group (1.6 +/	0.6, P &lt; 0.05). Of four promoters, P4 was the most powerful, P3 was the second, and P2 was weakest. Transcripts from P1 were the fewest, and they were only detected in two specimens. The value of P4 was 2.06 +/	1.26, P3 0.99 +/	0.72, P2 0.20 +/	0.20 in macrosomia group and P4 2.05 +/	1.27, P3 0.98 +/	0.80, P2 0.19 +/	0.17 in normal group. There were no significant differences between two groups (P &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: It is possible that over expression of IGF(2) in placenta contributes to macrosomia while the promoter usage and imprinting status are not associated with macrosomia.

PG	390-3
AB	OBJECTIVE: To study the genetic mechanism of Liddle's syndrome in a family and help the diagnosis (specially ante-natal) and treatment of Liddle's syndrome clinically. METHODS: (1) Physical examination and measurement of serum potassium, plasma aldosterone and renin activity respectively by biochemical and radioimmunological assays were made for the member of the family. (2) Venous blood samples were collected from the members of the family and total genomic DNA was prepared. One set of specific primers was used for direct polymerase chain reaction, for amplifying C terminus of beta-subunit of epithelial sodium channel (hbetaENaC). Polymerase chain reaction products were subjected to single-strand conformation polymorphism and direct DNA sequence analysis. RESULTS: A new frameshift mutation (1bp, INS, 600G) of the gene of C terminus of beta-subunit of hbetaENaC was found in the Liddle's syndrome family. This mutation introduced a new stop codon at position 605 and deleted the last 34 normal amino acids from the C teminus of hbeta ENaC. Eight genetically affected subjects had severe hypertension and suppressed levels of plasma aldosterone and plasma renin activity; half of them had hypokalemia. CONCLUSION: The frameshift mutation (1bp, INS, 600G) of hbetaENaC gene is the likely cause of Liddle's syndrome in this Chinese family.

RESULTS: The methylation rates of P(15)(INK4B) were 84%, 0, 50% and 75%, respectively, for 25 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 15 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), 16 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and 12 multiple myeloma (MM). P(15)(INK4B) gene was frequently methylated in patients with high risk MDS and early stage of MM. CONCLUSION: Hypermethylation of P(15)(INK4B) gene is one of the main causes of its inactivation. Hypermethylation of CpG island was closely related to the development of malignant hematopoietic diseases.

PG	664-7
AB	OBJECTIVE: To diagnose and detect the molecular defect in a suspected patient with Prader-Willi syndrome. METHODS: Genetic diagnosis and molecular genetic analysis were performed by using chromosome karyotype analysis, methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR), and linkage analysis using short tandem repeat (STR). RESULTS: The karyotype of the patient was 45, XX, der(5), t(5;15)(q35;q13), -15, and the parents were 46, XY and 46, XX, respectively, implying that the unbalanced translocation t(5;15) in the patient was de novo. Furthermore, MS-PCR and STR linkage analysis confirmed that the patient's 15q11-13 deletion was resulted from unbalanced translocation on paternal chromosome 15. CONCLUSION: Genetic analysis should be applied in suspected patients with Prader-Willi syndrome to confirm the diagnosis. Cytogenetic and molecular techniques would be helpful in clinical diagnosis, genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis.

PG	717-22
AB	OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship between the polymorphism of the variable number of tandem repeats region 3' of the apolipoprotein B gene (3'APOB-VNTR) and serum lipid levels in the Guangxi Heiyi Zhuang population. METHODS: A total of 548 people of Heiyi Zhuang nationatity were surveyed by a cluster sampling. Epidemiological data were collected and serum lipid and apolipoprotein levels were measured. The genotypes and alleles of the 3' APOB-VNTR were determined by polymerase chain reaction combined with gel electrophoresis, and then analyzed by direct sequencing in the most common alleles. The results were compared with those in 496 people of Han nationality also live in that district. RESULTS: There were 19 alleles of the 3'APOB-VNTR in both ethnic groups. They were hypervariable elements (HVEs) 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62 and 64, but HVEs 56 and 58 in Heiyi Zhuang nationality and HVEs 48 and 62 in Han nationality were not be detected. The most common allele is HVE32 in Heiyi and Zhuang nationality (25.9%), and HVE34 in Han nationality (27.2%). The frequencies of HVEs 26, 30, 46, heterozygote, and short alleles (&lt; 38 repeats, S) were higher in Heiyi Zhuang nationality than in Han nationality, whereas the frequencies of HVEs 34, 38, 40, homozygote, and long alleles (&gt;or= 38 repeats, L) were lower in Heiyi Zhuang nationality than in Han nationality. The levels of total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoprotein (apo) B in Heiyi Zhuang nationality were higher in VNTR-LS (carrier of one long and one short alleles) than in VNTR-LL genotypes (the individual carrying two long alleles) genotypes. The levels of TC, triglycerides, HDL-C and apo B in Heiyi Zhuang nationality were also higher in homozygotes than in heterozygotes. There were no significant differences in the detected lipid parameters between the VNTR-SS (carrier of two short alleles) and VNTR-LS or VNTR-LL genotypes in both ethnic groups. CONCLUSION: The 3'APOB-VNTR polymorphism is found to be significant difference between Heiyi Zhuang nationality and Han populations, and is associated with the serum lipid levels in Heiyi Zhuang nalionality but not in Han nationality.

TI	[Detection of Prader-Willi syndrome by methylation-specific PCR].
PG	54-6
AB	OBJECTIVE: Using a faster and more efficient method to diagnose Prader-Willi syndrome(PWS). METHODS: Differential DNA methylation at several sites in the PWS critical region where the maternal homologue is unmethylated and transcriptionally active. Methylation-specific PCR(MSPCR) is based on sodium bisulfite treatment of DNA, which converts unmethylated but not methylated cytosine residues to uracil, and PCR primers specific for the maternal and the paternal allele. Methylation analysis by Southern blot is made to validate the MSPCR result. RESULTS: Bisulfite-modified DNA from PWS patients amplified only with methylated allele-specific primer pair showed only maternal 174bp PCR product. MSPCR and PW71B methylation studies showed an abnormal pattern consistent with the clinical diagnosis of PWS. Untreated DNA does not produce a PCR product. CONCLUSION: MSPCR can be used to detect all presently testable causes of PWS (deletion, uniparental disomy, and imprinting mutation) in an efficient first step for stepwise diagnostic testing, compared with either Southern blot analysis which is more timeconsuming, or fluorescence in situ hybridization(FISH) which can not detect uniparental disomy or imprinting mutation.

PG	1313-7
AB	OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of polymorphisms in the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) promoter 4G/5G polymorphisms in Chinese Han population and to investigate whether they are associated with pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE). METHODS: Samples of peripheral venous blood were collected from 101 patients with PTE diagnosed by high probability of lung ventilation/perfusion scan and/or multi-slice CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) as well as medical history and clinical manifestations, 67 males and 34 females, aged 48 +/	15, and 101 age and sex-matched healthy controls from the same geographic area as controls. The genome DNA was extracted from the whole blood using potassium iodide-phenol-chloroform method. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC), and sequence analysis were used to screen the single nucleotide polymorphisms and the genotype distribution of -675 4G/5G located in the promoter region of the PAI-1 gene. RESULTS: The frequencies of the allele 4G of PAI-1 gene in the controls were 0.495, significantly lower than in the PTE patients (0.733, chi(2) = 24.060, P &lt; 0.01). The frequencies of the allele 5G of PAI-1 gene in the controls were 0.505, significantly higher than that in the PET patients. The genotype frequency of 4G4G of the PET patients was 57.4%, significantly higher than that of the controls (30.7%, P = 0.000). The genotype frequencies of 4G5G and 5G5G of the PET patients were 31.7% and 10.9% respectively, not significantly different from those of the controls (37.6 and 31.7% respectively). The presence of 4G allele of PAI-1 gene was found to be a greater risk factor for PTE. In comparison with the controls, the OR of 4G4G + 4G5G, 4G4G, and 4G5G in the PET patients were 3.794 (1.786	8.060), 5.443 (2.416	12.260), and 2.450 (1.067	5.623) respectively with the P values of 0.001, 0.000, and 0.035 respectively. CONCLUSION: The 4G/5G and 4G/4G genotypes are associated with the pathogenesis of PET.T.

TI	[Study of correlationship between congenital heart disease and 5, 10-methylenetetra hydrofolate reductase gene's polymorphism or folacin intakes].
PG	700-4
AB	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlationship between congenital heart disease and 5, 10-methylenetetra hydrofolate reductase (MTHFR)'s C677T or folacin intakes, and to study the interaction of them in the occurring of congenital heart disease. METHODS: We used case-control study (case = 104, control = 208) method. Cases and controls were chosen by age, sex and other conditions. The MTHFR C677T genotype distribution was analyzed by using polymerase chain reaction restricted fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), and non-conditional and multi-conditional logistic regression analysis were also used to analyze the correlationship and interaction of the factors. RESULTS: In case group, the number of people in low folacin intake level was 38 (36.54%), which in control group was 21(10.10%). The intake level of folacin during pregnancy was related to congenital heart disease (chi(2) = 31.614, nu = 1, P &lt; 0.0001). The value of OR was 1.417 with 95%CI 1.216	1.651, indicating that the low level of folacin intakes was a risk factor to the congenital heart disease. In case group, the number of TT genotype was 46 (44.24%), the number of CT genotype was 42 (40.38%), the number of CC genotype was 16 (15.38%). In control group, the number of TT genotype was 39 (18.75%), the number of CT genotype was 114 (54.81%), the number of CC genotype was 55 (26.44%). A significant genotype distribution difference was identified between case and control group (chi(2) = 23.13, nu = 2, P &lt; 0.0001). Genotype MTHFR 677TT was a risk factor of congenital heart disease and the OR value was 3.437 (95%CI: 2.042	5.784). The interaction analysis suggested that the low level of folacin intakes and the MTHFR 677TT genotype had a positive adding effect in the occurring of congenital heart disease. After adjusted some factors such as the ages of parents, fetus age and sex, the effect values of interaction were 13.343 and 15.911 respectively, and the percentages of attributable interaction effects were 0.619 and 0.612. The percentages of effect values of interaction between pure factors were 0.649 and 0.637 and the population attributable risks were 25.26% and 27.82% according to the estimated exposure rate of population risk factors. CONCLUSION: The low level of folacin intakes during pregancy should be a risk factor to congenital heart disease and the MTHFR 677TT genotype be correlated to congenital heart disease. There is interaction between folacin intakes and the MTHFR 677TT genotype. Increasing the intakes of folacin among MTHFR 677TT genotype people might decrease the incidence rate of congenital heart disease.
